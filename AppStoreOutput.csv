Bring back Gandhi plssss | Love Max but man can y‚Äôall please stop taking Harry Potter away. Ya girl can‚Äôt keep jumping streaming services. These are mad times we live in, MAD TIMES. | The app does not find any of my devices. It's the only app that does this and nobody wants to watch movies on the phone. Thanks | Movies, TV shows, and sporting events with high resolution - WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT? | I‚Äôm constantly being told I need to sign in on the Apple TV app. This wouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal except for the following:

1. Prompted to log in to Apple TV app
2. Use WiFi to authenticate on my phone 
3. Apple TV app shows as logged in
4. Try to play something 
5. Get prompted to login
6. Repeat forever. It will never work. 

What I then need to do to get it to work is delete the app and reinstall it. 

I can then login as expected and play something. This will work for a day day or two until I need to do it all over again, delete the app and re-login.  It wasn‚Äôt always like this, but it has been happening for a long time now. | Amazing work and amazing company | This app is so bad.  I think the current rating is fake.  With SO MANY bad reviews and my own personal experience.  It is hands down the WORST streaming app of them all.  Netflix is 1000x better.  Stop messing with the app.  I dont even know why I pay for the service with how bad it is.

I can‚Äôt even watch a show without it constantly reverting back to the beginning or some earlier point and then I have to find my spot again.  This issue has been going on for months.  I have reinstalled it. Same thing.  I don‚Äôt know how you guys made a mediocre streaming app into absolute GARBAGE and continually make it worse | Add more police series | I really hope a developer reeds this and responds. Please üôè. Max is one of my favorite tv streaming service!
It‚Äôs great and the design is great! Also you can watch Friends on there! If you don‚Äôt know what Friends is then watch it

But I have one thing (and it‚Äôs kinda stupid) you should add more profile pictures. You don‚Äôt have a wide variety.

GREAT APP!! | Consider business and partner up with The Walt Disney Company ! | It‚Äôs a very amazing app, so easy to use. But! , it we‚Äôll be great if you add more Spanish audio options on the movies, i like to use this app with my family and there‚Äôs sometimes that our favorites movies or the must greatest movies are not in other languages‚Ä¶ this makes me choose other streaming apps options so; if there ware a way to add more audio or subtitles with different languages (Spanish on this case) that should be awesome ! (I mean, if I‚Äôm paying to use it, I think I can express this comment and suggestion‚Ä¶ ) and  I will rate with 5 stars. So it‚Äôs that! The app it‚Äôs very good ! 
I recommended ! 8) | Not sure where the well known HBO app went, but this Max app is weird and when I tell people about a show on the app, I say ‚ÄúMax‚Äù and they say ‚Äúwho?‚Äù Changing to Max was a bad move. Also, STOP SHOWING ME COMMERCIALS FOR AN APP I ALREADY PAY MONEY FOR!! I get it, ads are a thing, but forcing me to watch Max ads? I‚Äôm already paying, I know I‚Äôm paying aging for the version with ads, why are you advertising yourself? Anyway, would give 0 stars if I could. The content is great, delivery is shockingly bad. | Since last one month or so login takes long time. And system asking to login multiple time during the week. | Wont let me speak to a person and has terrible and limiting options when looking for troubleshooting help | A lot of glitches in the app. Shows don‚Äôt start where I left off | Not many shows or movies only and handful and most not something worth watching but every now and than I hope for a new movie or show once a month! | Doesn‚Äôt work with Chromecast. I‚Äôve tried every troubleshooting tip I could find on the internet. All of my other apps cast with no issue. | Max has great sports, really good movies and tv shows, that are certainly worth watching. I was watching HBO when it first came to cable in the late 70s and my loyalty is certainly deserving‚ù§Ô∏è | I really like this one very much | I would VERY much like to have a custom option to BLOCK all the stupid shows and movies I don‚Äôt want to see repeatedly on my option screen 

Like a option were I can block anything that I don‚Äôt want to look at and then not have it show up anymore‚Ä¶ 90% of most stuff on every streaming service I don‚Äôt want to watch or look at | Just not a lot on and especially new have to see shows. Netflix and others keep pounding them out monthly so kind of disappointed with the subscription so far | I‚Äôve had it for a couple years and this is my first review on anything amazing movies amazing shows I watch. Literally almost everything on here. It‚Äôs a definite get | When you‚Äôre watching the show on your phone, most of the time it gets locked into it and it‚Äôll keep playing so you don‚Äôt notice anything is wrong, but then you go to pause or do anything and it‚Äôs not responsive to the touch, so it just keeps playing until you have to completely close out of the app. THEN it‚Äôll keep playing the sound for at least 10 more seconds so your phone is just speaking the movie lines. THEN you go back into the app to go to the episode you‚Äôre still on and it doesn‚Äôt have a record of it. So instead of picking up where you left off by clicking ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù you have to click on the small buttons and navigate to the correct episode in which is starts all over and then you have to watch the ads all over again. It‚Äôs awful. | Me entretengo mucho y tiene pel√≠culas muy padres | It seems like a lot of shows that are newer are not on here and the older shows are just OK | Really? Get out of here with your fake answer. You broke your app. Fix it. This is not a user error. This is you screwing up entries in your library. Fix your platform. don't condescend to me with your garbage canned answer. | i <3 young sheldom | It‚Äôs the best streaming service platform for the thinking person. HBO, with the Wire, Sopranos, Curb, Veep, Insecure and so many other cult shows, dominate in terms of TV library. Plus they have new episodes of Game of Thrones, the White Lotus, so many good things. Movie wise, selection rotates but has so much cool stuff, from the Dark Knight and action movies to classics to dramas. They don‚Äôt really do a great job with comedy, but besides that they‚Äôre so solid. The app itself is good, not a great app but fairly reliable. Download speed is pretty good, interface is easy enough to understand. 9.2/10 | I mostly want good movies. Make more of them everyone. Fun times at the movies. | Got to Hawaii on the first day of NCAA tournament and Max was the only option. It just worked üí™üèªüèùÔ∏è | Hdur | I have gone in literal circles trying to figure out how to log in after purchasing the subscription through regular Amazon. I can‚Äôt figure it out and just wanted $10. Nothing on either Amazon nor max website was any help. | My favorite movie! | Way better than Netflix | Easy to setup and very large selection
Highly recommended !!! | Does anyone else have a problem watching things on Max on their Chromebook? my screen constantly flashes black when I turn a movie or show on. it has never done it to me with any other streaming service or any app in general, it‚Äôs a new brand new computer (had it for maybe 2 weeks). I make sure my computer and Max is updated and I even uninstalled+reinstalled Max but it still does it. | Cki | Cacca | cacao | Gage | Amazing content. Reliable platform. Boom. | Happy I get to watch my shows | This is the best I can watch Deadpool | They have the original Wizard of Oz so now I can introduce it to my daughter. Good stuff | Terrible. Downloads always disappear as soon as i try to open them on the plane. No logic to home page or which shows it promotes. Bad algorithm. | I‚Äôm happy for the people that like sports. I however, do not. Please give me a way to ignore sports on the Home Screen! | Add more new and older movies the horror section is a little boring. | Sin duda tienen los mejores estrenos me encanta su resoluci√≥n y

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what‚Äôll be trending tomorrow.

Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

‚ñ† Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

‚ñ† Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you‚Äôre interested in.

‚ñ† Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you‚Äôve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we‚Äôre enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically.

From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it‚Äôs about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

‚ñ† Open social networking ‚Äì coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

So far I am appreciative that this App seems more informative and topic related. Not meaningless viral stuff with constant prompts to buy Advertising, Likes and Followers. Will be more active once I get more free time. | Yeah wow | This is a scam app that will steal hundreds from your Apple account. | How do I remove it? | Unfortunately not a good replacement for Twitter due to the weird promotion of sports and entertainment and the inhibition of politics. What can we expect from the oligarchy though. | So far so good! Kind of nice to have fresh and newüëç | The Threads team hit it out of the park. It is genuinely a better experience than ‚Äúthe other place‚Äù. Keep it up! | ü§© | Stop forcing everyone to do what YOU want on this freaking app. Not being able to remove this badge from the tops of our accounts and FORCING us to download the app to remove notifications is STUPID. Having the badge and notifications is incredibly annoying. | I love Threads and the content that shows up on my thread. ü´∂üèæ | The latest update has made Threads almost impossible to enjoy. Posts seem to be presented in no logical order. It‚Äôs difficult to find the accounts that I follow as they seem to be mixed with random other accounts. What‚Äôs going on Meta? | I love to write & communicate in brief carefully worded notes through text& email, this is a fun addition for me. | I am having major problems with this app. I have downloaded it a couple of times and each time it freezes. I can‚Äôt get it. Nothing!!!! I updated and nothing. It just freezes up. | Man yall gotta do better | It‚Äôs not user friendly.  Confusing. | Watching my cat stack stacks on the racks tip toeing on tacs | Threads When you‚Äôre in the all tab and when Account adjust to you so like the app is just new account. Can you please bring a feature? We can turn that off in that section so if you don‚Äôt want that on and you just want it on in a different section in the app that would be great. so in the app recommends you certain accounts you might be interested in. Can you please bring a feature that you want it in a different tab you don‚Äôt want it in that section in the app. | There‚Äôs nothing to do on this dumb app it‚Äôs literally like instagram and facebook I absolutely don‚Äôt recommend this app it‚Äôs a waste of your time and a waste of your storage. | The best social network ever!üíï | Enjoying threads | Buenos d√≠as | This app was good for about a week,  then I couldn‚Äôt see any comments in any of the accounts that I follow. | Removing the Following Feed was the most colossally stupid thing to do. Why do you think we follow accounts? So we can hunt for them in a feed you‚Äôve decided we can see? You‚Äôre making the app unusable to the point of pointlessness with this change. | Ive been using Threads since it 1st started and the growth has been tremendous. 

I‚Äôve enjoyed the user interface and how easy to use it is. The community that I‚Äôve gravitated too has been NBA Threads. The discourse of fandom along with high lQ basketball convos has been awesome. 

I also love the connection with my IG account too along with networking with bigger accounts. Love it! | Be been loving this app, and the people I‚Äôve met on it. I use it daily, and find it easy. They update regularly to add new features, and the community seems largely supportive. This last update has ruined it. It now makes my eyes strain far more than it used to, and other apps don‚Äôt have the same issue. This is a big issue, and will definitely minimize my use of the app. | Pru√©balo esta bueno | Threads stands out as a sanctuary for artistic souls, offering impeccable curation of diverse talents. Every scroll unveils captivating content, from intricate illustrations to breathtaking landscapes. The platform fosters a vibrant community of like-minded individuals passionate about art, fostering engaging discussions and support.

Temu has great stuff for a reasonable price & you don‚Äôt have to wait to long for your package to arrive | I play all these games and have only 1c left and it always wants new friends and then you have to keep adding them not fair to people who don‚Äôt have any and can‚Äôt share to get some free stuff.its frustrating when the share you need and to get that 1 little point you have to add a new friend and they have to accept.Temu might have to start doing it differently. | One of the few complaints I have with Temu is the complete absence of large size clothing. There are a few exceptions but really, there are people in the world with waist sizes larger than 38 inches. | I got my stuff | I got my order exactly like it said on the website for really cheap and everything came exactly as expected | En los juegos nunca llegan al final son infinitas personas la ms que hay q invitar ufff | I thought it was gonna be better than Amazon for the prices we‚Äôre good a scam to the little game so we keep probably or when you invite people to the app not getting nothing returned. You can‚Äôt even get your items I say, until they fix that problem the going back is the chances of me and Kim Kardashian on a date | I love this app. I have loved everything that I have bought from Temu. Recommend to everyone. | Me gusta mucho | Meilleure vente en ligne | This has been an incredible discovery!! I lost enough weight that my clothes are now at alterations! I have quality taste.. classic designer style and have filled my closets.. to the brim with dresses.. and tops-and delightful clothing for my classic style! Yet.. fun- pretty.. for an incredibly low price! For top -top -top quality! I‚Äôve also purchase items one can‚Äôt really find anywhere else!. I‚Äôm so very pleased! Incredibly speedy delivery‚Äôs! And the jewelry.. rings‚Ä¶ really beautiful quality.. and so low, I buy many gifts now! Thank you Temu ‚Ä¶ for all this pleasure! First class right at my door! | But don‚Äôt like your shipping method. Many things have come damaged or smushed. | Estoy muy agradecida y complacida con todos los productos adquiridos | Thought it was fake turns out it wasn‚Äôt | Loved it | Just takes long to ship | Very nice. | Don‚Äôt bother even using the games, their very laggy just want you to share to others and it‚Äôs completely impossible to win the free stuff your playing the game for. I have been on it for 3 weeks straight everyday feeding my fish and my crops and yet the game does not want you to win next thing you know you need a dollar and it only takes 20¬¢ off of a dollar. This game is a definition of catfish, if your going broke jus say that. Also rating is a 1 if the creator tries to change it like they did with the other bad reviews. | Excelente | Leaked some of my information | I like buying random things and this helps keep my spending amount to a minimum | Funciona buenos precios | Love Temu, I do pretty good and I‚Äôm happy with the majority of my orders!  Every now and again I get a dud ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Temu is a great site for cool little stuff. Great prices, good deals. Ships quick and no return hassle's. Highly recommended! | S√∫per bien variedad de art√≠culos con excelente calidad y sus precios son razonables | Temu has everything for cheep and is very nice and free shipping 100/10 for sureü§© | The wait most definitely a good wait for there items | Very happy w service | It has been almost a month and I still have not received my order so give me my $46 back | I love shopping on the site it is extremely easy to find the right size color, shape, etc. there‚Äôs a wide variety of items I highly recommend shopping on this site | Awesome company   Fast shipping  Aaaaa+ company. Customer service is the best I ever seen thanks again (TEMU) | I love Temu just wish it did not take so long to get the shipments but over all good thank you Temu | Awesome thanks for the info | Temu is addicting to shop! Some items are amazing while others are a ‚Äúget what you pay for‚Äù quality. Returns are extremely easy. Playing the games to get ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù is impossible though. They want you to continuously invite new people over and over, which becomes rather annoying. | I love Temu. I find items that I can‚Äôt find anywhere else and they are handy and affordable. | Deber√≠an de regalar o dar descuentos cuando haces varias compras ya e echo varias en menos de un mes y no me dan descuentos favorables ni mucho menos regalos deber√≠an de dar regalos por hacer varias compras en menos de un mes | Icould shop here all day if only Ihad more money. But Ionly get pay every 20days | Just need to get better at when you purchase something and you tell the customer if you buy three items you get this then you pop up with $200 coupon bundle never got that brought something else gave me a 200 bond added an extra hundred which supposed to be $300 bond never got that because y‚Äôall have so many pop ups is difficult, pressing the button because it comes up so fast other than that your site is awesome with deals on clothing everything A+ | There are so many things that Temu has. I like buying things . | after ordering on temu for the first time, i started getting random charges, 30 some from apple, 10 something from pandora, random 3 dollar one, which none of those have been me. i did not order from anywhere else but from amazon. (which i do all the time with no random charges) i got refunded for my apple one because it was on someone elses apple account under the name kylie. i have to order new card now, i would be more optimistic If I didn‚Äôt hear about this happening to other people, and if it didn‚Äôt happen to my mom. she ordered a few things from temu for christmas, and then she started getting a few random charges, I remember one was a 10 dollar donation to the Red Cross, and temu was the only place she ordered from. I‚Äôm giving it two stars because besides all that, I did get the products I ordered but the quality was hit or miss though. | I ordered from Temu when the package arrived I had missing items so I contacted Temu to ask for a refund 6 times and I have been denied Temu is a fraud and a scam ! | Temu has the lowest prices and great quality items. I‚Äôm always excited when I know I‚Äôm getting a delivery that day! My kids love their clothes too they also sell
Furniture and everyday items so dirt cheap you have to hear on this! | Great deals | Everything I‚Äôve bought has been in excellent condition.

I can't see my recent history | I really like the news aggregation of the app. However, as I am scrolling and reading through news stories it will randomly update the whole feed and I lose the other interesting articles on my feed. This happens so randomly it‚Äôs quite annoying. Sometimes when I am reading or if I leave the app for 1 second to take care of another notification. When I come back I watch as the app decides it needs a refresh and watch all the news stories disappear in front of me.

Is it a glitch in the app or is there something in settings to correct this that I‚Äôm not finding?

Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google‚Äôs business model is advertising based.

Now you have to login to cable provider. Every time you open the app‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. | Show randomly quit displaying or get stuck in the repeat mode‚Ä¶terrible situation | It‚Äôs just a score board if you don‚Äôt have a TV provider. ‚ÄúFree‚Äù to watch is free for now but not in 20 minutes. Google does the same. | I love that I can watch all the games from one source, but please fix this issue I am having with full screen. Example: when I rotate my phone clockwise to full screen, the screen will rotate clockwise like normal, but then do a complete 180¬∞ flip to the other side. It does this all the time. The video is always upside down! | This app crashes ALOT. It makes you re-authenticate all the time, and each time you do, adds adds adds. That‚Äôs another thing, constant adds. You log in, ADDS. You switch games, ADDS. You re-authenticate, all the time, ADDS. Then the crashing, the only reason I‚Äôm writing this and not watching is because you guessed, it crashed, again. | Doesn‚Äôt let me watch games just loads | This app is the worst. It never plays the games just keeps playing ads. I press play and expect to see the game. I‚Äôm signed in same everything but the app won‚Äôt show the game. | There are several technical glitches in this app. When you‚Äôre watching a live game and it goes to commercial and then come back to live game sometimes it goes to black screen and you have to reboot the entire broadcast to get to the live game. This happened three times in the past 45 minutes today.
They‚Äôre also a lot of freezes during the live game, and you have to reboot the stream to start it again | Right now the app is good | Connecting takes way too long. When it does connect it plays briefly before disconnecting. Rinse. Repeat. | What‚Äôs with this one shining moment video?üóëÔ∏è | Everyone 2 minutes there is a error and I have to reconnect the whole process over again | Amazing app | Both the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs tournaments use the moniker ‚ÄúMarch Madness.‚Äù This app explicitly excludes the women‚Äôs tournament and no equivalent app is offered. It‚Äôs almost as if the NCAA has a history of underselling women athletes‚Ä¶oh wait | It‚Äôs 2024. Give women equal due. How hard is it to put in a toggle between the tournaments. (It‚Äôs otherwise a great app, my go-to in March.) | Where the ladies at? Sexist developers think they don't have to label this ""Men's NMML,"" but everhone is as sexist as them and we'll just know it excludes women. If it's just men, call it that, because this is NOT NMML if it does NOT include women. | Am I missing something? Can‚Äôt get to women‚Äôs brackets! | You‚Äôd think by now they would have updated the app to include the women‚Äôs games and brackets. Most of the way they advertise this app is College Basketball NCAA March Madness‚Ä¶. There are two parts to that. Men and women. Just funny that the NCAA continues to not care about the women‚Äôs sport even though it is on a meteoric rise and could gain so many more viewers if they made games more easily accessible. 

But I guess only the men‚Äôs games matter. | Great game last night. So glad I got to watch thanks to this app. | Can‚Äôt sign into Tv Provider.  Just like last year.  Amazing the NCAA sticks with this technologically inept group. | Add the ability to cast to local network devices back on the app you cowards | Love it | Glitches every time I try to gain access to watch games. Embarrassing that this app wasn‚Äôt ready for this time of year. | It kicked me off despite having signed in before and being on my home wi-fi. Also, it only allows me to tilt my phone to one side to watch. If I try to flip it to the other side, the picture flips upside down after about 30 seconds | Not a single option on the app to watch the women‚Äôs games. I don‚Äôt see an alternate app either. Very disappointed in NCAA once again. | This is a GREAT app! Some of my favorite parts are coloring scores on my Lock Screen & many parts of this app are free! | Spinning ‚Äúsunburst of death.‚Äù Works on iPad, but not iPhone. Sad day. | I love the whole tournament with all of my heart and I want to watch every game. But for whatever reason it won‚Äôt let me sign in with my tv provider on the app. It works just fine on the website and I can sign in there but for whatever reason it will not let me sign in on the app. ITS SO FRUSTRATING!! So please fix this issue soon!!! | Only lets me watch it for 9 minutes | It is easy to use and you can look at what you need but sometimes you can‚Äôt watch the games . | The games will play and the screen then goes black and plays just audio of games already played | Had to delete the app because I could click to connect to my TV Provider (Xfinity), and the app would just spin and spin. Tried everything. Forced quit. Delete and re-download. Doesnt work. 

Going to just use NCAA.com instead | Well noted! Thank you | GREAT APP!!! But i rly wish that we didn‚Äôt have to have a subscription because it would be wayyyyyy more easier and more people would have the app üôÉ | Can‚Äôt log in with my tv had issues for 2 years now | This could be the worst app in the App Store. It may be good for personal use with your devices but the minute you try to stream it to you your TV it craps out constantly. Then, to get it working again, you have to watch 2-3 commercials before you get back to the game‚Ä¶. this cycle repeats every 5-10 minutes. Horrible experience. Not worth your time if you plan on streaming. | But the teams that I picked to win aren‚Äôt winning | We all want one full screen split into 4 quad so we can watch all 4 games at one allowing to switch sound by touch | Love it. Comes in handy to keep up. | Keeps spinning and spinning. Restart app, on WiFi, off wifi. 
Now to the bigger issue, as others have said: no women‚Äôs bracket?!? Seriously?!? In todays day and age? | March madness includes women‚Äôs basketball, women‚Äôs hockey and men‚Äôs hockey but none of that is here. | I was pleasantly surprised that this app was offered up.  The first time I used it, the screen would randomly switch to a different game, which was annoying.  Eventually, it stopped happening so that was a relief.  I really like the feature where I can watch 4 games at once.  But, where in the heck are the Women‚Äôs games?  I thought maybe there was a different app for the women but ‚Ä¶ nope. This wasn‚Äôt just annoying.

It shows the word continue I press it and nothing happens | The App took my name and falsely stated that I was arrested for a crime committed by my son. | I‚Äôve been trying to use chat gpt to help me with my algebra. However I cannot use algebraic symbols and a symbol keyboard is not supported. I would love to see this added in an update from developers | Incredible tool that will only get better. | Thank you AI for helping me understand the world around me in simplified terms. I use this to read legal documents that otherwise confuse me. It has helped verbalize what I want to say in a clear manner. I can also rely on, mostly accurate information. 

It has literally enhanced my life. | ChatGPT has been an incredibly useful tool for me. Whether I need quick answers to questions, assistance with brainstorming, or just want to engage in interesting conversations, ChatGPT delivers every time. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, and I appreciate the diverse range of topics and information available. The responses are consistently helpful and well-articulated. Overall, I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile AI companion. | Sing in failed ? Why | Its so good for homework | app works great, fantastic.. but can't control & protect privacy security settings nor featuresüò§ | Constantly gives inaccurate, redundant and often even outrightly imaginary answers to basic prompts. Never had this issue in earlier versions of this app. It seems to have reduced its capabilities? | ChatGPT is a bit like having your very own J.A.R.V.I.S (Iron Man reference) in the palm of your hand. Ask it almost anything and it will answer with the closest thing to a perfect answer, if not already perfect. I‚Äôve even named mine JARVIS üòÜ Exceeds expectations with amazingly detailed, informative, and swift returns. Literally the A.I. we used to see in futuristic movies growing up, but in an app. Definitely recommend giving it a try. It has helped quite a lot in my personal life as well as in my career! | Used to be great, but lately the app doesn‚Äôt refresh to show latest history even if I refresh it, kill the app and even reinstall the app. The web version is what i use now. The app is non-functional. | I love this app. Sometimes when I‚Äôm stuck or need a brainstorming session, I just type in my thoughts and in return get amazing ideas! This is so helpful when I am a solo entrepreneur and don‚Äôt have anyone to brainstorm ideas with. Highly recommend this app!! | I like it | I love this!! | I‚Äôm really enjoying using this AI so far. It‚Äôs amazing what you can converse about with it. | Almost unusable. Audio is constantly interrupting, has no adjustable time delay, and replies back with very long replies so you have to wait forever to tell chatgpt that it misunderstood yoi. This causes a loss of train of thought as you fight with chatgpt, that doesn‚Äôt even realize it has a text to voice feature. 

Generally ChatGPT seems to be getting worse as a product. It‚Äôs still a usable tool, but as soon as something equivalent or better comes out I‚Äôm dumping my paid service. | What a fantastic breakthrough!  OpenAI really did a good job! | After I subscribed to plus, the company banned my account and did not refund, cheating. | üéØüôè | ŸÅŸàŸÑ ŸàÿπŸÑŸä | Im gonna get rich thanks to Chat Gpt!
Thank you Open Ai! | ChatGPT 4 makes ChatGPT 3.5 look like a Palm TX. I'm still new to the app, but I've used it on both my Macbook and my iPhone. The iPhone version does not include some of the features available on the desktop version, such as editing a prompt after it has already been submitted. Otherwise, I think it's very easy to use and extremely handy. It's difficult to think of a reason why I would give it less than five stars. | It cool | It‚Äôs a great app | very incredible he liked it a lot 5 stars plus my 10 stars very good the creator of the app for iOS I thank you for helping a lot with the app I am grateful for you there are many interested in helping users gratitude for my presence
best application I have used to date, world the world, with that I thank you so much | Even though it makes mistakes, it more often surprises me with its thorough and thoughtful responses that go above and beyond a search engine. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun simply to ask it questions and then a follow up question to see what it shows. Even when it misses the mark, I see something cool.  The future might not be here yet, but it‚Äôs good to see we‚Äôre heading in that direction. | I love this app it helps me be creative and work by helping me like an personal assistant.
Would recommend!
üëç | The latest update released to the web, ios, and android, completely broke ChatGPT for coders. Coding a responsive Navbar with a navbar slider does not work now. And trying to get most codes to work fails now. Please don't go full Gemini on us. | Every time I ask ‚Äúmake a essay about space‚Äù it says ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù

ITS SO ANNOYING! FIX YOUR APP | Chatgpt is really smart and trained.  But when I ask make Dwayne Johnson in ChatGPT  I have ChatGPT 4 | This app is good. It always gives trust worthy answers and would totally recommend!! | It‚Äôs soooo goood get it NOW!!! | This is a great personal assistance for anyone to have | I don‚Äôt recommend put in my email and password & it was the same one I use for google and all my accounts got hacked almost immediately. They sell your information to 3rd parties and the app is not secure. | Sign in failed
An error occurred during fetching values for the user. 403 | Saved me so much time | The AI seems to be unable to change the way it types. When asked to make a typo or not use exclamation marks, it was unable to, tho it still thinks it could (ironically with a ! at the end of each message). 
When asked to form pictures from text, it struggles greatly. Tho it can somewhat do it, the picture can be unrecognizable at times. 
You cannot be in a low-wifi area or the AI simply wont respond, so I can only sometimes use it during school. 
It is very clear that it is programmed with certain biases, even if it can be made to admit that the biases it has are baseless. Like in one conversation I asked the AI about it being considered alive, and that even biological organisms technically have ‚Äúcoding‚Äù. It was very bent on saying that it was absolutely in no way ever possible of being considered living, despite admitting that that it is an ongoing debate and that nothing on the subject is definitive and proven to be true. 
I also think it would be cool if the speaker that can read the text to you, could be manipulated so that it can talk faster or slower. To me, the speaker speaks terribly slowly for the essays the messages tend to become. 
I also notice that sometimes it does get information wrong, but that it can be corrected most of the time by asking it to fix itself, tho it is strange to have to need to ask it to check its answers, I feel there should already be a system where it checks its answers BEFORE sending. Tho this isn‚Äôt a big problem, the amount of mistakes it has made is very small, and the mistakes are usually benign. 

Otherwise it has been extremely helpful in pretty much all things, without even needing to get any premium version. | It actuall was able to help me a lot with questions that I needed a awnser to, but the small trick sometime you have to be really specific, which still isn‚Äôt a big deal | I can do many duties in less time and solve many complex writing tasks as owner of a business. Also helps me a lot to translate same writings to other languages for clients abroad. Frankly speaking, I saved a lot of money using this app instead to hire freelancers in Upwork. | ÊàëÂ∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ª‰∏çÂºÄgpt‰∫ÜÔºåÁªô‰∫ÜÊàëÂæàÂ§öÁÅµÊÑüÂíåÊñπÊ°à„ÄÇ | ui is good and it js works | CGT is an agreed job of evolving and helping humans prepare for the largest shift in human history. It's time to Adapt! | We need the APP to support simplified Chinese! | The paid version of Open AI is worth it weight in gold! | It‚Äôs quite smoothly to be used on website, but can‚Äôt not login the app and the error message I received even can‚Äôt be searched it on Q&A page | It‚Äôs a great and all but when it comes to shape, it‚Äôs really wrong like for trapezoids I had to correct it three times and then it finally got the right answer and said I was right. you can‚Äôt find the area I don‚Äôt think he knows how you do 0.5 multiplied by a number for fractions. Sometimes it puts the wrong number in instead of the number I give it. Other than that the app is really good and please fix it. | This is data from jan 2022. Particularly difficult to ask about anything pertinent since so much political, events, law and technology has occurred since. | This app is awesome. I use it throughout the day.

Hundreds of people have been locked out of their accounts for several days including me, and Instagram posts random scheduled content as if nothing is happening. Just a terrible app with inconsistent servers which causes everyone to panic every few months when Instagram isn‚Äôt working or force locks people out of their own accounts for no reason.

Imagine having your servers shut down so much that a hashtag like that exists‚Ä¶ | I dont have it, give it to me | When it comes to certain topics, Instagram is working very hard to control the narrative and silence anyone who tries to speak truth.

This is not an app for 12+!!! Instagram is so sick! | I‚Äôm not able to login my account | Since Insta went down for thousands on March 22nd, I‚Äôve not been able to login via the app.

Please allow editing of messages for a longer time | WhatsApp is widely used to communicate internationally, thus it is bewildering that it still does not have a translation feature. Facebook, it‚Äôs parent, has translation built-in. | I decided to use the extra security and implement the 64 encryption key tool. I saved all the numbers in four different places I had copies of it. I had screenshot. I wrote all the numbers down and saved them in several places so that I would not lose my WhatsApp data.

When I had to reinstall my WhatsApp. The app told me the key was wrong. I know the key was correct. I lost all my data. I lost so much important information. I can‚Äôt begin to tell you the magnitude of  info I lost. 

Do NOT use that encryption key unless you are prepared to lose all vital data in your WHATSAPP account. | It keeps making me think people have blocked me | Que pasa? | Love who created this | I have tried to register my phone number and it kept saying try again in 1 hour.

Completely unusable. | Google maps is horrible about not giving directions until after you pass your turn or telling you right before it‚Äôs time for you to turn. I hook my phone to my car for a reason, so I don‚Äôt have to sit and continuously look at it. I almost got in a wreck because of this app. Fix this problem Google. This is why I quit using your app before. | I used to love this app but I can‚Äôt google any address without it prompting me to download the app I have already downloaded then opens the app without the location I googled. Awful when you are in a hurry. Sticking to Apple Maps. | Trying to road trip, Google maps is always reliable. This trip it keeps changing our route to another route that‚Äôs 45 minutes longer and has tolls. WHY. Also, my estimated arrival time is missing. I can‚Äôt do math across time zones to figure out what time is 12 hours 45 minutes from now. HELP. | Love the way the directions are spoken to direct me to locations. | There should be a spot on the map for those who are moving. A spot ware you tell it that you are towing and able to set a max speed such as 55mph for better time accuracy towards your destination. | App is a actually a good app to use and find places The only down side is that it leads you the far way to get to your destination otherwise it‚Äôs really good. | App seems glitchy lately.

1. Arrow gets stuck at starting point after leaving

2. Ghost routes keep popping up in areas where there isn‚Äôt a road(ie. Non existing roads going through houses) | Coco loco was amazing would homey recommend this place as long as he is here .

Their morning job was terminated so they called to move if possible 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the appointment. I could not accommodate so they cancelled an hour prior by leaving a voice message.

Stated excuse was due to the square footage of the house. If that is true they have very faulty procedural issues in screening their appointments.

I‚Äôll open the app, walk to my car and suddenly poof, it‚Äôs closed, forgotten the address and I‚Äôm back to square one as I sit in my car. Or I‚Äôll pull over on a drive to get gas, and again poof it‚Äôs gone again. It‚Äôs so dumb. 

Or and being able to copy and paste like a normal computer would be LIFE CHANGING. | This app can be dangerous to use while driving. For example, you can‚Äôt turn up the volume of the narrator at any time. You have to do it while the narrator is speaking the directions which makes you constantly taking your eyes off the road in preparation to turn up the volume. This is how it works on the iPhone. | Never lets me down. | In general, this app works very well. It gets me where I need to go, and it lets me know when there's an incident ahead and how to get around it generally. But why does it do weird things like take me off an exit, then straight through and back onto the interstate I was just on? That can be very frustrating when you don't know where you're going, and all you have is map to depend on.
Also, can you please tell me why there are praying hands on my map reviews? why would anyone be praying for me. | This is the best pizza lace on Stagecoach Rd. The staff is Amazing and completely awesome Sauce!üíúThanks for Blessing my familyüôèüíú | Ok, this is a one-off! But, based on principle I feel the need to share.

My issue is with the AMC 
Theater.  Last December I purchased a gift card from the AMC Theater at Randhurst Mall for my wife for a Xmas gift. $100
The lady who handled the transaction was clearly having a hard time‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve made her show me the money on the card before i left.  Fast forward to February 2024 when my wife and her friend went to the AMC to enjoy a movie‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs no funds available!  I‚Äôve reached out to AMC in multiple ways and they seem to not care! 
I will never step foot in an AMC theater again unless they make it right! If any of you would like to join me in my boycott of all AMC 
theaters please feel free!

They are way overpriced, I had to pay extra to get my dashboard cleaned. Left solution on my side window and I had to get someone to wipe it off. Dashboard wasn‚Äôt cleaned and I paid extra for it.

Be kind to us. | Your site is evil and unsafe for families. | It has so many options to watch and this is just me but I LOVE watching therian videos bc I am one and it‚Äôs really nice.

No other app on iOS works this poorly. Why not just use the native Apple TV app? Because it‚Äôs not installed. I don‚Äôt want my kids on it.

I recommend it ‚Ä¶100 /. | Great service Always! | I love Gmail, I always recommend people to use gmail! | If I can‚Äôt preview my email from the notification banner on my Lock Screen anymore, then I will turn off the app notifications altogether and check my emails the old fashion way. This new update that forces me to open the app every single time is anti productive. Not every email I receive needs my immediate attention, so I don‚Äôt always open them right away. However, there are a few that require special attention and I can no longer differentiate between important and nonessential emails with the new notifications system. Therefore, I am turning off notifications altogether and I will check all of my emails at the same time; which is when I get to them! Edit: Newest update fixed the problem. Google, seriously don‚Äôt do that again. That was so annoying, I even considered switching to yahoo mail (ü§Æ). There is a reason people use your service and not others, don‚Äôt ruin it for yourselves. | I am having real trouble getting back my original ‚Äúgmail‚Äù account!!! It keeps sending me to a u tube app to confirm who I am! And to tap on a code sent to me!!! But no where on u tube app does it allow for entering any codes!!! Very frustratingüò¢ | This app has always been perfectly fine, but just recently it has stopped showing the previews in my notifications of what the email is. I have not changed any of my phone‚Äôs settings and made sure they are correct, so I don‚Äôt know why this is happening, just that it is incredibly inconvenient.

This app would be five stars if not for this issue. Please do look into this. Thank you! | Love Google! | Nice to know people care about others. God Bless & Thank You | Super great at deleting critical reviews and not improving their product for 20 yrs. | Paying for the $2/month plan and i had a lapse due to forced-odd schedule for a month. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU PAY FOR STORAGE AND LOSE FOR NONPAYMENT, it is possible to NEVER receive an email sent during this period. Even after clearing space and coming back to fix payment, an important email i was expecting will now never come through. I get other emails, but I'm not getting the one i NEEDED again i guess, Sadly the site I'm needing doesn't have a ""re-send email"" option so I'm just S.O.L. there bc of a greedy corporations paywall | Ease of use makes life less stressful üòÅ | The new update eliminated the message preview on the Apple Watch rendering the app much less useful. Hopefully this will be resolved quickly or I will need to switch all my emails to another provider. | If you like looking at a giant exclamation point with the word error written below - this is the app for you! | I often get notifications on the app that aren‚Äôt actually emails. Like, it shows that there‚Äôs a message but when I click on the app everything is read. It‚Äôs confusing and they don‚Äôt usually go away unless I restart my phone. | I really like the gmail app | Newest update messed up the vertical centering/alignment of the Home Screen widget. Please fix!!!  Looks terrible. | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | This app suite ang fit may personalities | Working great. | This app works ok, I can get and send emails, but how does it not have a ‚Äúmark all read‚Äù feature in 2024?! And this is *only* an issue on the iphone version, WHY? | Every email received it adds a contact even though I disabled it on a browser.

No simple way to delete contacts. Huge pain in the butt.

Yet, app is required for authentication. Another pain. | Trying to merge old gmail accounts isn't working or it acts like nothing happened after clicking merge accounts and logging into the second account. | The browser and app reset frequently.
You lose a lot of progress on something if you do that. | Por m√°s que borro y borro correos nada que libera espacio , lo √∫nico que sale es que page m√°s y m√°s dinero cada vez | Ok | I need to clear my account mail! It‚Äôs not trashing it!! And it‚Äôs to much junk mail!! | Text hasn‚Äôt been showing randomly for emails when sent. Somehow others are seeing them. If I copy and paste it I can see it in another app. Fix this bug please! | In the latest update, they‚Äôve included a feature where you no longer can see a preview of the message on your Lock Screen, thus forcing you into the app to view any content whatsoever. 

This artificially will boost their user sessions and overall user time in app, where it hadn‚Äôt before but is a significant detriment to the overall user experience.

There seems to be no way in settings to revert it to previously, and as a result has me looking for alternative mail apps. | For the past month or so, I have had the gmail page go black and the only way I can fix it is to delete the app and redownload it! What‚Äôs going on? Don‚Äôt try to blame my internet source because this only happens with gmail! Fix it please!
After hearing from gmail support on how to take care of the problem, I‚Äôve upgraded my review.  However, it‚Äôs only been 2 days with no problems.  I hope it continues.  Thank you support. | The dark mode setting of Gmail always follows the iPhone system and cannot be turned off (I would expect options between on/off/follow system) . The fact that Gmail didn‚Äôt keep this simple and useful feature is beyond understanding. Please bring it back! | This new update is awful. Definitely pushing me towards a different platform if it doesn‚Äôt go back to being able to preview the message without accessing the app. This has to be the dumbest thing to come up with when your phone settings allow you to choose if you want a preview or not. Why did google change it. Awful!! | nice. | Stop making me open the app and let me see my email notifications | The latest update broke notifications so that they only display ‚ÄúYou have a new message,‚Äù making them functionally useless noise. | I decided to start using Gmail on my iPhone for personal emails instead of Hotmail, but have encountered problems using it that I‚Äôve never had with Hotmail. 
First, when composing an email, you can‚Äôt swipe it down to refer to another email in your inbox. You have to copy what you‚Äôve typed, tap X to cancel the new email, look at the other email to get your information and then start your email over again by pasting onto a new email because it often doesn‚Äôt save the draft of the email I started.
Second, it‚Äôs more difficult to copy a photo in the body of your email or add as an attachment. Sometimes it will do neither and ask to add it as a file or on Google Drive.
Third, and most importantly, it seems to have nowhere near the storage capacity as Hotmail. I‚Äôve used Hotmail for over ten years and never had a notification that I was running out of storage and that I should buy more. I‚Äôve only used Gmail for about five years and I‚Äôm getting the notification that I have 83% of my storage used. I also have Google Photos app, so that may have contributed to that, but I have a number of photos and recordings on Hotmail too. The storage issue is the reason I am going back to Hotmail. | ‚ÄúYou have a new message‚Äù | Google chat isn‚Äôt easy to navigate | This guy was so mad üò° and then proceeded with a video and then I was in my bed üõèÔ∏è crying üòø because of his poor posture.. | Never any space/storage yet when I try to go through my emails to delete a few, no new emails are appearing. I‚Äôve had gmail since 2017 and never had problems with storage. 

Don‚Äôt bother creating a new email because they will link it to any of your google accounts, then you have the same storage issues. Bye gmail hello yahoo. No thank you I don‚Äôt want to pay for extra storage | Since last 3-4 months, I have stopped receiving any notifications. I have to manually check all the time. Please fix. | You really gotta stay out of our business for starters | I like Gmail because it turns bits and bytes into words on my screen and because it sends packets of data through the Internet network from one location to another.

The app constantly crashes and shuts down and it freezes through every program or movie that I watch. It takes forever to upload any program. I‚Äôve tried to uninstall it & I‚Äôve tried to update it and nothing seems to help and this happens on every device I have. I really enjoyed this app at first not sure why this keeps happening. I have read multiple reviews and everyone is having  the same issues. It‚Äôs like nobody‚Äôs listening and trying to fix the issues that everybody is having. It constantly keeps showing technical difficulty messages on my screen. Not sure how much longer I‚Äôm going to continue to pay for a service I can‚Äôt even enjoy. | Today they launched the latest update to their app. It wouldn‚Äôt seem possible given the consistently poor performance, but this iteration beat expectations and is epically worse than before. Indeed it is the worst entertainment app on the market. The usual and consistent problems w/ fast forwarding, the tendency for it to jump backwards to a previous segment, and the endless, repetitive commercials one has to watch while trying to get back to the spot you were actually watching, still exist. (Advertisers would be well advised to check the numbers for accuracy, to determining me whether they‚Äôre inflated by being forced to watch the same commercial numerous times while the app jumps you back and forth). 

But the newest difficulty is that when a show is put on pause, they put a graphic up on the screen along with an advisement to hit any key to resume. Of course the graphic stayed on the screen no matter what until I fully exited the app. Anytime I tried to resume, it resumed with graphic on screen. I had to exit, start the show over, watch a series of commercials, fast forward to try to find my place, was forced to watch more commercials, before resuming. 

It defies belief that Paramount could so consistently hire coders who lack the computer literacy of a 3d grader. Or perhaps they‚Äôve decided to get into the black by designing their app so that they can bill for the multiple commercials I‚Äôm forced to watch and rewatch everytime I want to pause, fast forward, or rewind in order to watch a show. Maybe it‚Äôs time for the FTC to find answers to these questions. | Good that they have champions league and other games.
But they‚Äôve started the garbage move of making you watch 5 commercials, when you‚Äôre in the middle of watching, a f√∫tbol match. | Lost my payback position after going to background,  episode has started from the beginning and I had to watch 4 round of ads while I was seeking to position I was watching on, not to mention this is paid subscription, wasted 10 min due to app glitch. | I love watching paw patrol and the movies | Casting the app from an IPad to TV crashes every time a commercial comes up. | Want this on your PlayStation or smart tv? FORGET IT. Thing doesn‚Äôt work. You don‚Äôt dare pause a show because it‚Äôll flat out stop working, or you‚Äôll have to back out and it‚Äôll restart the episode/movie. Good luck fast forwarding to your place. You skip the intro and your CCs stop working. The only reason I have an account is because it came with my Wal-Mart+ account. | This app is horrible for playback in on iOS device. It hangs up and repeats the same part of the video constantly! It has to be restarted multiple times to watch a show. | This is absolutely the glitchiest streaming app there is. No matter if you‚Äôre watching on a smart tv or apple product. It‚Äôs absolutely infuriating. | Way too many ads! Loved this app but now its profits over customer satisfaction. Wish I could get the old version of the app where I paid for Paramount minus the Showtime and ads.

Paramount+ Response = üëéüèª | Paramount seems to have fixed their app recently.  It‚Äôs working better.  So since they have requested me to update my review, I‚Äôm updating my review to give them a more positive rating. | Ssss sde | This app is awesome and I would totally recommend it but my shows pause a lot and make me go out and back in.ü§©‚ûïüòê=üòÅ | Received an email stating that the issue with the black screen was resolved and for me it is still not fixed. Just get a never ending black screen and customer support is always‚Äùbusy‚Äù and not helpful. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money on this service all the other streaming apps work WAY better | I subscribe to paramount + mainly for Star Trek content, but have also found other shows to enjoy on the platform. I‚Äôm currently trying to rewatch all of Star Trek Discovery to prepare for the new season, but have given up because of its horrible interface. When I pause, the ad gets stuck on the screen while the show plays behind it.  I‚Äôm forced to back all the way out of the show to the Home Screen, but then the app has not been saving my place. THEN when I try to fast forward to my location the app forces me to watch a ton of ads on top of constantly sending me back to the beginning of the show several times before getting to within 5 minutes of my previous stopping point. I use the fire TV set up also, I only have these type of problems with the Paramount app there as well. I give up paramount. I may unsubscribe and find another way to watch. Please FIX YOUR STREAMING SERVICE. | I like this app a lot I think it is really cool and it has so many fun shows for me to watch! You should get this app!üòúü§™üòùüòõüòã | Even the commercials glitch and freeze. I literally haven‚Äôt been able to get through a movie or even one episode of anything because of the constant interruptions and crashes. It‚Äôs a shame because the content is great but unfortunately I can‚Äôt enjoy any of it. The Super Bowl stream was a mess and major disappointment too. I am cancelling my subscription and deleting the app, what a waste. | I have the subscription. It only works on my phone and won‚Äôt work on TV. TV shows no subscription. Then, when I try to cast to TV it will only play ‚Äú80‚Äôs for Brady‚Äù. It won‚Äôt play anything else. 
Ridiculous. Ready to cancel. | Great movies and tv shows it‚Äôs a must have if you like Nickelodeon. Great kids shows, and I can stream my favorite movie MEAN GIRLS because I can‚Äôt find it anywhere else . | Love the app use it almost daily but since the update I haven‚Äôt been able to use it üò© | Doesn‚Äôt work on anything but the first Apple TV used to sign up for it. No browser watching works. Also plays tons of unskippable superbowl or other commercials on the ‚Äúad free‚Äù plan. Customer support chat has you hold for a long time then disconnects you and Emails you saying you disconnected them. Email to them gets no response. | I‚Äôve had a lot of streaming apps, and Paramount+ is by far THE WORST. I got it to watch sports, and specifically soccer tournaments like UEFA Champions League. But Paramount redesigned the app recently and it no longer gives you the option to replay full matches. So if you miss it live, you‚Äôre out of luck. The worst part is that Paramount customer service is totally unresponsive. | Sick of trying to watch on my tv and I get 2 seconds in and the app freezes and barely works. We have no updates!!! It‚Äôs very frightening paying for something I can barely watch | For cryin‚Äô out loud! Stop trying to be cute with your comments regarding your app updates and tell me exactly what‚Äôs been fixed! EDIT: And an extra star removed for the canned response to the above request. | App seems a little bulky. Not all shows available in the app that are owned by Paramount. No support available, just a generic email response.
Update: Developer responded with more of the same their help site which doesn‚Äôt answer every question.  As of a result of their response their review is getting downgraded further because it‚Äôs a joke. | im getting like 12-18 ads per episode its ridiculous | From day one it has always been filled with glitches that you would think would get addressed and take care of but they absolutely don‚Äôt care because they got people‚Äôs money already. | Why is it every time we open this app it thinks we stopped halfway though the previous episode and in order to skip to the next episode I get to manually click through 46 seasons to find the current one because you can‚Äôt click backwards from season 1 | I hate this app. | I tolerate paying for a subscription but still having to sit through commercials, but when I tried to rewind about 30 seconds in my show to catch something I missed it made me sit through a commercial. Then when it finally went back to the show I was lost so I rewinded some more and had to sit through a commercial again. It‚Äôs been wild to see streaming be so revolutionary only for it to just turn into cable‚Ä¶ | App needs improvement | I don't understand why this app is so bad. Barely works on my phone, randomly quits on my tv and Xbox. And it's been like this for a couple years no matter where I am or what devices or network I use. | Yo > | This is truly the worst steaming app ever. I‚Äôm trying to watch season 46 of survivor and it freezes alllll dayyyyy longggg. During the show, during the commercials. It would probably take me 5 hours to watch a 1.5 hour episode. Please fix this or get a better tech team. | I would give paramount 5 stars plus if they would not cancel EVIL after this 4th season.

Paramount, you are a huge mega corporation, you can afford more seasons of that show. 

But I am super happy with Halo and Taylor Sheridan‚Äô s works also. 

As for ease of the app itself, I have had zero issues and give a 5 star rating to the developers.

Keep the bringing on new cool stuff. More Star Treks would be nice. There are countless alternative reality possibilities there. I would  incorporate more Star Trek Movies to Segway into new tv series.

Bringing back Picard and that era was a win win.

Hire Joe Neuberger as a writer. He is a master at marketing, a comedy and sci-fi genius, and he‚Äôs right there in Hollywood already. He knows what people want to see. | The content on the app is great. But this is the only streaming app that buffers during every show. | Have to reinstall too much | I use 6 other different streaming services on my wifi with no problem. This one stops to buffer every 2-3 minutes. Thank God I get it free through my credit card or I would have cancelled it immediately. | Unbelievable a company this size can‚Äôt produce a reliable app. Download if you like your streaming service

686449807,"ph.telegra.Telegraph","Telegram Messenger","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?uo=4","Pure instant messaging ‚Äî simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don‚Äôt need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

Recent (frustrating) bugs that I am experiencing:
1) When in preview of sending someone an image, the buttons on the bottom act disabled and I cannot send (they are indeed not disabled but do not perform any action when tapped)
2) App crashes unexpectedly when sending attachments. This does not happen every time, but it is getting to the point where I lost count.
3) App crashes in general when sending a message.

I have attempted to uninstall and install to perhaps bandage these issues, but it has not helped. When I first got Telegram, over 5 years ago, the quality was absolutely superb.

Also, it helps prep with job interviews, helps with resumes, and cover letters. I would like it to better understand what I am after when asking for a sentence that is professionally engaging.

I‚Äôll come back to it if there‚Äôs a fix (Yes I deleted the app and installed it back.. also restarted my phone.. same problem continues) | iOS build introduced new bug: Sign and hamburger menu is over laid where iOS clock is which makes this icons not-clickable | It is now impossible to use the menu icon nor the elipses icons at the top of the screen. I already hated that iOS has this dumb notch, now this app has forgotten to compensate for this dumb notch and its icons are now placed overlapping with the clock and the network/battery level, so I can no longer select ""Designer"" nor can I see any previous conversations | The copilot AI itself is helpful if a bit stubborn at times, however the previous conversations and settings buttons are so far in the upper corners of my screen that they can‚Äôt be pressed.

- 1 star for amateur review fee

It‚Äôs cheaper than having to uber to a restaurant, especially while traveling. However, doordash will absolutely nickel and dime you for every small thing, and they pocket so much of that rather than share with the driver. 

It serves it‚Äôs function. Any alternative; walking/driving to a restaurant or even cooking at home, is way better. Also there is always a chance your driver tampers with your food, so just cross your fingers that the driver is feeling nice. | I use the app because I‚Äôm busy. I don‚Äôt want drivers sending me messages to give them a good review. If I‚Äôm ordering on this app it means I‚Äôm busy and don‚Äôt want to be pestered. I should only be contacted if there‚Äôs a problem. Also too many illegal immigrants driving for Door Dash. I prefer to give jobs to US citizens. | After listing an order for my entire work team, the address for the location was way too far, and we couldn‚Äôt change it without re-listing everyone‚Äôs order. Additionally, it‚Äôs a scam to automatically resume dashpass for every single order without an appropriate warning. I‚Äôve lost $50+ because I kept being automatically signed back up. Good grief. | In multiple occasions my food has been not delivered and refund transaction have not connected. Wouldn't recommend 0 outta five. | DoorDash has ruined my bank account. I've spent over thousand dollars. It has ruined my life.üòÄ | DoorDash is kinda cheap it depends on what your getting but I love it cus it‚Äôs so fast and I don‚Äôt have to go all the way to somewhere and I can just DoorDash it so you should really try it! | They always make their food so good and it‚Äôs always delivered when said through door dash. Thank you Taco Bell. | On time at door Ty | This guys that‚Äôs delivering,don‚Äôt speak no English,and they steal my food twice | App is easy to use. I love the function that the driver can text especially since I am at a hospital and delivery is tricky. | It‚Äôs convenient especially when your at work. However, some dashers be taking there sweet time to get to you and by the time you get your food it‚Äôs an ice cube. There‚Äôs just some things that can‚Äôt be reheated because it would taste nasty. Also, this app is for everyone they get mad when the poor people can‚Äôt tip and some say that they shouldn‚Äôt DoorDash at all that‚Äôs not fair or right. We‚Äôre poor but still have a lil bit to get food when we‚Äôre hungry. I have a job and I have to work in whether I get tips, bonuses or not. lastly, the tracker needs to stop lying to people because your order is always on time because the longer the Dasher takes the time changes for it when it needs to arrive, it‚Äôs never late because they‚Äôre always changing the time so when it says ‚Äúarriving on time‚Äù it‚Äôs actually lying. | It‚Äôs ridiculous how different the prices are for this app just to have food delivered to you. The convenience is definitely worth it at times. | Insanity and good üëç | Es seguro y confiable | I have not experienced any problems with DoorDash . So far I appreciate the convenience of ordering from home . | So I ordered SONIC and they brought me McDonald‚Äôs, I requested a refund but it got declined, I tried to call them but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I tried again but it said I couldn‚Äôt get my money but I still didn‚Äôt get my money back | They keep double charging my bank account for the same things over and over again. | the first time i ordered never got my food | Not at school. Can‚Äôt validate driver license | I love how u can order stuff when u don‚Äôt even have too leave ur home so far it‚Äôs been great with all my orders | I have never once gotten even lukewarm food. Always cold but costs more . Just go get your own food this is such a scam and they treat their drivers like garbage. | I was ordered a food delivery in February 2024 and that‚Äôs the only once. After that I deleted the apps. 
However today when I was checking my credit card transactions report. In march 18, 2024. Someone ordered a food online and DoorDash charged me without my approval. This is totally unacceptable | Worst app there is | Most Dashers can‚Äôt find my place even though I give them specific instructions and they don‚Äôt speak my language so that‚Äôs very frustrating and some of them are very rude so I‚Äôm really tired of that and I‚Äôm gonna cancel my DoorDash after this month | Do not use this app. There are so many other delivery service apps out there just skip this one. 
Because If you order something and the driver drops it off at the wrong location you are screwed. Not only will DoorDash deny your refund but they won‚Äôt issue a reorder, they won‚Äôt tell you why they denied the refund and when you ask to speak to a ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù they will call you at 330AM in hopes that you‚Äôll miss the call. Haven‚Äôt used this app in years and this is what happens the first time I place an order. Customer service is friendly but ultimately useless. No one has answers and no one not even ‚Äúsupervisors‚Äù have any authority to help you beyond regurgitating the same information over and over again. Deleted my account and app and will be telling literally anyone who will hear it to not use this service. | So I live in a major city, and all of the restaurants around here have bad quality control - meaning I constantly have orders with missing items. DoorDash thinks I‚Äôm scamming them, so now every time I get a delivery I take a video of the dasher leaving it, me picking it up, and unpacking everything so it‚Äôs clearly visible. 

I even pay for Dash Pass, and I also used Express Delivery for this last order, which was still messed up. 

They STILL deny my claim for missing items. It‚Äôs even more infuriating because I used to be a dasher myself, so I know how the process works. 

BE CAREFUL, use other services if you can. | I‚Äôve waiting 2 and a half hours for a order I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and the food came ice cold and I was unable to eat it worst experience I‚Äôve ever had hands down. Me and my kids where hungry waiting for this only for all of us to be let down. | over $10 in doordash fees alone, nope. deleted the app 

pay the drivers better instead of passing the fees off onto consumers | I sent a refund request and ended up getting denied then I talked to an a gent very unprofessional I wasn‚Äôt able to get my money back for an order that was literally air I went outside nothing my dasher stoled my item and still had the audacity to come to my house to take a photo of the curb side. SMH I‚Äôm very disappointed. | literally the worst app possible for food delivery. | this isn‚Äôt the first time, I‚Äôve had 3 ordered cancelled after doordash picked up order. Not every happy. | Love the consistency! | I‚Äôve had DoorDash for over a year and never had an issue. I‚Äôm in the hospital right now so I decided to use it for a pickup order for my husband to go grab. Most of the food I got was absolutely rancid smelling and tasting, it immediately made me sick to my stomach. I tried reaching out to DoorDash to either get a refund or some credit through the app and was COMPLETELY ignored by BOTH the people I was connected with to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me. I wasn‚Äôt upset at all at first but after 30 minutes of just trying to get someone from customer service to acknowledge me I have become absolutely furious, which I feel is rightfully so. All I want is for the items that are bad and I have to throw away to be refunded, I feel like that‚Äôs not asking much! Although after that horrendous experience with ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù I feel like I should get refunded for my whole order for the inconvenience. | very good app | Lie about pricing. Charge extra fees don‚Äôt deliver and do not refund customers | Was delivered the wrong food, the bag had my receipt and then someone else‚Äôs on it as well. My order was double the monetary value of the food I received. Simple mistake, I was hoping they would fix it and instead they determined they were going to do nothing for me. After I spoke with two different support people. Thanks I‚Äôll never use you again. | Waited 4 hours, ended up not receiving the food, or the money I spent on the food, I was told a certain time to wait tell the app would help me out, once it hit that time nothing changed and still never received help. I never received a dasher and the time was consistently getting pushed back in 15 minute intervals until my meal I order at 6 was delayed until 8:30 when I cancelled my order. 
0 stars if I could | Ordered out of obligation more than 15x the last year and my most recent order was the straw that broke the camels back. Being gaslit by customer service was the extra cherry on top. Don‚Äôt recommend. | I don‚Äôt use this app much because it‚Äôs overpriced compared to ordering directly from a restaurant and the drivers barely get paid. However, the reason I‚Äôm writing this review is their ads. I literally uninstalled the app today because I am sick and tired of seeing the ads on youtube. I hate you. How can an ad be so annoying that I exit the video I‚Äôm watching and go uninstall the app and delete my account? But somehow doordash has achieved this. Amazing. Good riddance I hope the drivers sue you for better pay and win | Really getting to like this app | Door dash would just randomly charge and take my money with me purchasing anything. They took about $15 dollars without me purchasing anything. I work for my money and I want that money to be refunded. I‚Äôm not sure why this is happening. Very disappointed. | A bit surprised to see my order marked up $16+ to allow for service fees, too, and food markup. Disappointing‚Ä¶ just not even reasonable to use‚Ä¶ sad | I have used door dash just a couple of times. We usually cook or go out to eat. However, this is a very convenient option if you‚Äôre hungry and too tired to cook or leave your house. They‚Äôre fast and careful with your food.

1064216828,"com.reddit.Reddit","Reddit","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828?uo=4","Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.

Reddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.

Redditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You‚Äôll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.

Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:
‚Ä¢ r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions
‚Ä¢ r/funny, which is full of humorous content
‚Ä¢ r/science, for scientific discussions and news
‚Ä¢ r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure

On Reddit you‚Äôll find:
‚Ä¢ Thousands of community groups
Breaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.

‚Ä¢ Loads of laughs
Find memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.

‚Ä¢ AMAs, or ""Ask Me Anything""
Celebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.

‚Ä¢ The best discussions on any topic
Reddit‚Äôs discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.

‚Ä¢ Get answers to anonymous questions 
Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.

‚Ä¢ Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU
Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.

Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit‚Äôs social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator‚Äôs karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts‚Äô visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.

Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device‚Äôs Account Settings. No partial refunds.

Amazing that these gals show off their bodies  like they do . | Best place to read the opinions of other people from the public with no filters and moderators | Once you start you can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs a constant pipeline of politics, creeps, good people, and help forums | 1) force all 3rd party apps to shut down
2) force all users on to your broken, terrible app with a terrrrrrrible social media algorithm (‚Äúoh, you like the subreddit for the city you live in? Well what about the subreddit for *this* city and *that* city, all of which are on complete opposite sides of the country and whose issues have absolutely nothing to do with you??

Your days are numbered Spez ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ | (( ..I like to write and have conversation.
There‚Äôs soOo many different topics and communities here on Reddit, it‚Äôs awesome how this app allows its users that are of different ages, gender, religious/political affiliations, and cultures, etc,‚Ä¶ to connect/interact while being able to express our individual opinions, beliefs, creativity, ask questions, and learn something new in the processüíØü§≠..and it‚Äôs so easy to navigate -&- explore all the various features Reddit offers. I don‚Äôt usually write CV reviews, but..
‚Ä¶Despite being *new to the app but I love it already. Definitely the best social media/news app I‚Äôve seen so far. I can see üëÄwhy it‚Äôs called: ‚ÄúThe Heartüíúof the Internetüõú..‚Äù 
Respectfully,
üé∂üéµ‚ú®üòú))‚Ä¶ | I play Destiny and I always have been separate from the community (I don‚Äôt even have a clan) but I decided to check out reddit since they have the whole community thing (and it seemed less toxic/more organized than twitter.)

But reddit kept stopping me from talking and banned me out of the gate.

I‚Äôve heard bad thing about reddit all the time but I didn‚Äôt think it was this bad | Heaven forbid you don‚Äôt hold the same opinions as the rest of the community.  A seriously depressing echo chamber where no real conversation can be had | I decided to give the official app another try for a couple of months after coming off of not using Reddit since Apollo was forced to shut down. I missed the Reddit experience but the biggest thing that has been a drawback for me is how the Home page is not able to be sorted. I get on the app for one or two subreddit updates and then get so bored scrolling through Home with so many low upvoted posts that are junk. I haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúunfulfilled‚Äù browsing Reddit before and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll miss not having the app anymore. | Excellent rule 63 üóøüçºüêÑ | just joined, but i‚Äôm enjoying it, definitely learning how to use it, that‚Äôs for sure. | Reddit is chock full of scum. The most pretentious pieces of garbage occupy this app. Are you a big ol‚Äô piece of trash? Easily offended? Pretentious and quick to anger? Then this is the app for you. The app works great but good luck dealing with these folks. | I‚Äôve been using the app for over a year now and I don‚Äôt usually have complaints. But there have been sooo many bugs lately. I can no longer mute subs, it gives and error message. Even if I go into my settings and try and mute it that way it doesn‚Äôt work. Also I can‚Äôt leave posts on r/bugs to find out what the bug is. I can‚Äôt access my drafts or save any new drafts. There‚Äôs probably more but that what I‚Äôve experienced this week so far. Please fix this. Especially the mute option. Some subs I really don‚Äôt want to keep seeing in my feed.

Just checked apparently I can‚Äôt post on any subs period now. | Reddit wanted to go public so they made it so third party apps, developed by single individuals, couldn‚Äôt afford to operate. Then Reddit took all their money and resources and created the worst app in the app store. And since they made it too expensive for third party apps, Reddit forces us to use this god awful app. 

In going public, they also closed down subreddits for cannabis as inappropriate but left the meth subs remain. Anytime I think I‚Äôm not competent and won‚Äôt find success, I think of the Reddit leadership team and I know it will all work out. | Trust me, I know from experience this app can get you addicted/carried away and it makes it 10 times easier for teens to access nsfw content and it is even easier to hide it because no parents check reddit search history | I use to enjoy Reddit but now moderators openly abuse their power and can get users ban temporarily or permanently without cause.
There is child porn posted on Reddit and it‚Äôs not taken down in a timely manner. Open hate speech and other trash is common. 
I reach out to subreddit mods and they mute me or get me bad for trying to have them help or asking them to enforce their own basic rules.
I‚Äôve lost all faith in this app. 
You could do better and have a healthy app but they are choosing to host hate and illegal content. | Reddit has become one of the worse experiences you can use anymore. They pad all ads so large that any tap anywhere near them makes you open them. This gives them money. This is a scam. This should be illegal. They should be held accountable and Apple remove this app from the store. | Reddit has a lot of useful information that isn‚Äôt available elsewhere, it‚Äôs a good app to get your very niche hobbies discussion and what-not. However, the problem with Reddit is that the moderators are radical leftists and as someone who is actually a ‚Äúclassic liberal‚Äù (read ‚Äúnot an extremist‚Äù), this app is straight up unusable. 

1. You cannot say what you think because if you ever say anything controversial, anything that is even slightly against the echo chamber of whatever sub you‚Äôre in - you‚Äôre done because you get downvoted and lose your ability to speak which is anti-democratic. 

2. Radical leftist subs and themes are always boosted with bots. It‚Äôs very common to see an absolutely fake story or some kind of outliner that is posted by an account that ends up being deleted. You‚Äôll get a stream of responses and downvotes or downboosting of anyone who even questions that post. 
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the special agent Mike doing his job or a radical lunatic with a mission, or a scammer who wants to get free points and then use that to scam people‚Ä¶ no idea, but it is real. 

3. Extremist and terrorist feminism is wild on this app. Women are pushing their OnlyFans accounts, you‚Äôll see porn and sexualization on every step. 

4. Anti-men agenda even if you only visit animal pictures subreddits. I reported a post where this woman posted a picture of her cat and wrote that her cat also hates men. My account was suspended for a week for ‚Äúreport abuse‚Äù‚Ä¶ even though I‚Äôve never had this kind of warning before. 

5. If you visit subs that extremist moderators dislike, they will absolutely discriminate you, one of the subs being ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs Rights‚Äù. I don‚Äôt need to explain why, do I? 

Reddit has more danger to American youth than TikTok. You don‚Äôt need TikTok to ask someone how to cook your favorite dish or what to do if a video game doesn‚Äôt work. You need Reddit to get answers for that because nearly every other forum has been depopulated and discord is another can of worms. | Reddit will take down feminist posts fighting for body autonomy but leave up post after post of incels describing the things they‚Äôd do to women if there was a purge. Do better or delete it and do us a favor please. | Takes screenshot. Would you like to share?  

No I‚Äôm not sharing with anyone, the app doesn‚Äôt allow me to copy text so therefore screenshot and check my photos to copy text. | Tons of bugs and quirks, almost unusable at times | Title says it if you like drama they have it if you like it in the bedroom they have it it‚Äôs awesome | I don‚Äôt understand how this app is still so buggy after all this time. Every single video stops playing a couple seconds in or doesn‚Äôt load at all. It is glitchy, has unintuitive controls and options, and just overall not a great experience. You‚Äôd think that the official app would be more functional than the previous alternatives but it‚Äôs just bad. | Congrats to Reddit and the IPO on 03/21/24! Would‚Äôve loved to cash üíµ in on the earnings yesterday but was too busy finding the ‚ÄúSeizure Foci‚Äù of my brain üß† that‚Äôs been DX with Epilepsy for 24yrs now, after a severe MVA I was involved in back in 2000. | Would love it if it gave you a schedule for the game and events to come. | App is filled with basement dwellers, everyone is chronically online with a heavily skewed perception of reality. No one is sane and everyone is angry. JUST AVOID THIS APP. | Not a bad app, I just hate redditors. Also the app is very buggy. | It did say in app purchases so I assumed it would let me download the app and then choose what membership I wanted. Instead it charged me $16.95 just to download the app. Nowhere on the information did it say it would do that. | With all these ads and suggestions, you would think there would be enough money made to fix the bugs | I would like to block certain communities, but I couldn‚Äôt do that on APP. I went there once it doesn‚Äôt mean I like that community. Then I‚Äôll just delete Reddit | This app advertises a good place to get news and such, but when it comes to certain subs, people are just milking for karma and not providing useful info. Then, there is the politically biased information that goes around the site. Big subs like r/Politics are just huge cesspools, and hundreds of the biggest subreddits are ALL run by the same small group of mods. People who have pointed this out have been censored and banned from subreddits. I go to nonpolitical subs (Ex: Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and there is political bias. Subs that are explicitly against the politics of Reddit as a whole have been banned and raided before! Now those criticisms might seem silly but there are other genuine criticisms of the site. They ban conservative subreddits but don‚Äôt do anything about subs like ‚Äúr/AmongUsPorn‚Äù or ‚Äúr/OhioRape‚Äù (not sure what the whole name was bc I saw it off a Twitter screenshot where an OP asked if others would rape the OP‚Äôs mother and aunt), r/IncestConfessions, etc‚Ä¶ In short, Reddit is unhelpful, politically biased, and VERY degenerate. 0/10 would NOT recommend. | Nice IPO | Yep. | off. That‚Äôs it. It has no other value to me as a consumer. I don‚Äôt click ads. I don‚Äôt buy anything. | I hate the bugs in this app.  Want to write a reply only for it to disappear.  Want to scroll though a sub but it only works sometimes.  Want to watch a video well maybe.  It‚Äôs only gotten worse since they effectively killed all the third parts apps that actually worked. | Im not alone in this. There are so many waiting to see you again. Aha! The being inside must be able to tell. Thanks Reddit for allowing me to functionally amd systematically gain a communication with you. | Y‚Äôall the amount of prn on here is wild like Jesus Christ that is ll definitely not kid friendly | Can‚Äôt sort home on the app so it mostly shows garbage. The messed up part is you used to be able to sort it that way. | This site is used to disseminate harmful information used to extremely harm the civilian population. I tried to inform users and was shadow banned. However, if you‚Äôre looking for information on how to get away with murder and much much more, Reddit is for you.
This is probably why Reddit will never become a publicly traded company. Just saying, if you were actually good to the public you would have sold stock to the public by now. | Thought I'd give this a chance after they essentially murderer Apollo and Narwhal. It's still really bad. Riddled with bugs, clunky, slow and worst of all - forced. Reddit is circling the drain. | It is amazing and I love it so much content I am addicted | It‚Äôs a very nice place to be and it‚Äôs user friendly | Nothing but a weird propaganda app. People post fake liberal news articles and bots swarm the comments. That‚Äôs all it is, the dregs of society are the only non bots on this strange app. If you‚Äôre not in the lib or commie cult definitely don‚Äôt bother with this app, it‚Äôs just sad. | I downloaded this app because the mobile website blocks any ‚Äúmature‚Äù page in order to FORCE you to download their app. But if you click a link to a page and follow the prompt to ‚Äúview in app‚Äù it won‚Äôt even pull up the page you‚Äôre trying to read! This app is garbage - ugly design, impossible to find anything. | Terribly glitchy app.
Not sure if I‚Äôll continue to use it at this point. | Not sure why people are commenting as recently as the day I‚Äôm writing this saying ‚ÄúWOW CANT BELIEVE THIS AND THIS IS GETTING PUSHED DOWN MY THROAT AND EVERYONE IS SO ONE SIDED AND ITS FILLED WITH PROPAGANDA‚Äù; yeah, welcome to Reddit since 2019. It‚Äôs a terrible app/site and the fact it‚Äôs rated number 1 for ‚Äúnews‚Äù in the App Store literally made me laugh out loud when I saw it. Reddit is absolute garbage and everyone knows it. | Worst experience to cancel subscription. | I absolutely loved Reddit, however, I couldn‚Äôt stand the name that they assigned to me. Therefore I had no choice.

Then came their changes. Now we have to do tax stuff for it? I get it, people use that to get money and all that, but not having a way for us to access and/or update the forms is bogus. I can‚Äôt get any of my bitcoin. I won‚Äôt be able to get my card renewed. 

Worked with a ton of people. All were different every time I spoke to someone. They all had me do the same thing. The last one literally said there‚Äôs nothing they could do so they closed the ticket. Okay.. but what about my money? I just have to lose it?

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen much improvement with the overall user  function and user friendliness of cashapp..  as I‚Äôve noticed other apps improve, become much easier to quickly move money between my various external accounts. For example if I want to move money from s
Step to CreditKarma: I can go on either so, choose to move the money. Which accounts and it‚Äôs done.. but cash app is very confusing. You can save as many external accounts as you want.  But when you hit ‚Äúadd money‚Äù  only god knows which account it‚Äôs trying to pull from. I‚Äôm constantly removing and adding the same accounts so I know where it‚Äôs coming from.. 
I‚Äôve had to connect my step several times.  It successfully connects.. but when i attempt to ‚Äúadd money‚Äù from my step. It completely ignores the account and asks for a debit card #. When I attempt to add the step debit card number. It rejects it-stating that it‚Äôs not a debit card, but a credit card! Obviously it‚Äôs not!?  
I‚Äôve battled with this for my whole 3-4 years using cashapp. And it‚Äôs not changed at all! You would think ADDING money to your cash app from other external accounts would would be a pretty high priority on the update list ehh?  I suppose not. | I dislike using cash app. A lot of the times I‚Äôm fighting to receive my money sent to me from others.

Imagine watching a show with 3 seasons with only 2 available. Or a movie trilogy where the first is missing. Or the fact that there are some titles where they just show the last movie. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for anyone who loves movies and shows. I love watching everything but if its 1 thing i cant stand is watching a show with missing episodes or missing movies in a series. | I get it, some peeps share their Netflix password and Netflix has ‚Äòideas‚Äô how to cut that.

Deleting that app, canceling my subscription - don‚Äôt have time for Netflix‚Äôs anti-password share greed activities. 

Bye. Hello Disney, Amazon and Apple TV.

(Should be 1-star, but content is good, so 2-stars). | These is dose not have anything to do with the app but netflix i need all the inuyasha season's | Netflix is good but you can‚Äôt used it in other locations and they added adds now. It is like they only care about the money | So I tried to watch Netflix on my phone and for some reason I couldn‚Äôt get into my account. It said I had to put in the password so I did and it did not work. | It‚Äôs probs the best app for movies and shows etc. :DDDD | netflix is scamming at this point. high prices, low quality content, household policy. just switch | Hello, 

Just letting your company know what is happening with some accounts with the new Household and WiFi network restrictions. I saw that I couldn‚Äôt access my account anymore on my WiFi at my new apartment, so I was disappointed. I know my dad uses it at his house, but I also don‚Äôt want to pay more a month to watch the content. Luckily I have AppleTV, Prime video and Hulu to choose from after that! Bummer that I can‚Äôt watch Netflix anymore but at least I have those! Just went right to Amazon Prime after that. | Netflix can u PLEASE PUT SEASON1 AND 2 BACK UP LIKE PLEASE THATS MY FAV SHOW AND UR MAKING MY LIFE MISERABLE | With as much money as we‚Äôre spending on this app you would think we would be getting our moneys worth instead the app logs me out and says my device is not apart of the Netflix household even though the app has been downloaded on my tablet for years. And yes it‚Äôs been updated, yes the password and username are correct, yes the bill has been paid, and no it‚Äôs not my device. Fix it. | Netflix works great, problem is the dominos game was working now states ‚Äúan error has occurred please try again later sorry for the inconvenience‚Äù 

Please fix the problem. 

Thank you. | It‚Äôs good but can you please add be the cartoon grinch,coraline, and all of the monster high tv shows/short movies | This app and company have been going downhill for a long time, but I've hit my breaking point. The app layout CONSTANTLY changes. None of these changes are ever necessary, and they make the app worse and harder to use. Not to mention that Netflix as a company keeps making worse and worse shows and movies, and cancel the rare good ones that they manage to squeeze out. But I kept it, because my family still used it on occasion. Today I opened the app for the once-in-a-blue-moon that I ever open Netflix, only for the app to tell me I'm ""not a part"" of MY OWN HOUSEHOLD. The only reason that had been left to use Netflix is that multiple people can share an account, but with the sheer audacity of them to charge an arm and a leg for ONE account, banning password sharing WITHIN A HOUSEHOLD is the last straw. I'd give negative stars if I could for this unusable app and scummy company. Your money is better spent elsewhere. | What is the point of even having the app is I can‚Äôt watch anywhere other than home? Netflix has gone down the drain in recent years and I will be cancelling my membership. It‚Äôs no longer worth spending money on and I will be moving to a different streaming platform. | Signed out of ALL devices from the website. Logged into 2 devices I use . The 3rd (my iPhone) gives the error message the device is not part of house hold , but only have 2/4 devices signed in per the website . HHHHHHOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!?!?!?! And yes I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Same message!!!! | no me aparece nanaüòî | These ads are straight unreal and ridiculous. For YEARS there has been no ads and now you guys put ads? Take them off before you lose more money. | La pollo | Can‚Äôt log in ‚Äúpassword is wrong‚Äù (same password 8 years now works on the tv)
Can‚Äôt reset password ‚Äúerror email not found ‚Äú (same email address as always triple checked tried on several different days) | Won‚Äôt allow me to watch in my own home, it should be illegal. Cancelling all subscriptions with them, never use Netflix they‚Äôre bloody thieves | The new update is ok but I can‚Äôt find anything now and half of the stuff from continue watching is gone. Also, basically all of the anime I have been watching the past few years is gone and know I am basically left with none of my old shows.üò≠üò≠üò≠üíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è | the new household is stupid, canÀãt watch anything if im not on my house is annoying and stupid. | I‚Äôve always watched Netflix on my phone rather then my tv or computer, so as of recently I now have to get a temporary code to be able to use the service I pay for on my phone. So basically if you ever plan on not watching it on your tv you better be ready to have to go through a couple apps before you can have access to your account. Ended up cancelling cause they release a good show maybe once every 2 years anyways. A shame they raise pricing more and more then cut access to phone users | Netflix has become a greedy corporation and it seems to be worse than others. They kicked me off my family‚Äôs account because I‚Äôm not on the same network anymore as them. Sorry that I was military, got stationed away from home, and my father wanted to keep my expenses to a minimum. Y‚Äôall are absolutely ridiculous and not worth the hassle. | Greedy parasites just can‚Äôt seem to let go of their obsession with squeezing every last ounce of money they can from their consumers. I‚Äôm glad I canceled my membership because their catalog isn‚Äôt even worth the basic price | Unsubscribed | No real improvements to any of this.

The Netflix App is pretty much one of the worst in the market these days. It fails miserably on simple tasks, like it routinely shows you visually that it remembers where you left off (red bar is in about the right place, button text says resume), but when you try to resume, it simply starts at the beginning. This happens about 15% of the time when you stop and resume on the same device, and almost half the time when you are changing devices. The UI is also a disaster and just getting worse all the time. Your ‚ÄúMy List‚Äù will randomly disappear or relocate itself, the team is proud of the dark ui changes they make, which make the product harder to use but artificially inflate their use/engagement numbers, and various menu items like notifications or whole content sections will randomly disappear and reappear or just bug out when you select anything. The app will only go into PiP mode about 80% of the time, and always pauses. The app also pauses on tablets when you slide anything over. Like, WHY?! The subscription has become much more expensive, and content quality is getting worse every day. The company seems to think their UI and processes are good, but really they‚Äôre not, they just had a great idea and implemented it before everyone else, so they were the only way and many people grew up with and got used to it, but it never made it good. Their foreign content (non-US) is still very good, but also seems to be on the decline, and their streaming quality is still very good. Their US content, however, only has a few good properties left and tend to be one-offs or seasons from much earlier that are wrapping up. They like to say they have the best products, properties, culture, etc, but they really don‚Äôt. I use the iOS products the most, but their android apps are no better, and I use the web and smart tv app on occasion and they are definitely worse. The frustration of using this app is no longer worth the price with so many other, better, cheaper options available. | I pay great money for the services and i can‚Äôt even use it on all platforms. they underpay actors and actresses for the streaming services, but then they overpay us, so where is the money going? Dont buy; just pirate shows. | I‚Äôm a college student under a Netflix my parents pay for, the household rule is ridiculous. They already have a limit to how many people can be on an account, is it really necessary to block people based on where they live? It‚Äôs such a blatant money grab, it‚Äôs honestly embarrassing for Netflix. Raising the price while making it harder to use is just going to send the (already dying) service into the toilet. | The new update to Netflix households is so inconsiderate to families with college students. I spend half of my year at school and the other half at home, but now I can‚Äôt access netflix at school. Terrible, truly do not care about their paying customers | ü§ìü§ìüëç | no total drama world tour?no no noüò° | Crazy how it keeps getting more expensive, with less content. Now they‚Äôre even blocking some movies behind a pay wall so their ‚Äòstandard‚Äô isn‚Äôt good enough to be able to watch your favorite movie | PLEASE get rid of Netflix households. If anything it‚Äôs probably hurting you guys more then helping. It‚Äôs just annoying and Ik ur trying to stop hackers and get more money but some people can‚Äôt pay for subscriptions that‚Äôs why they share. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Netflix has an amazing selection of shows but this is ridiculous. | I can stream on my browser on my IPad! So, is this a massive app update failure, or another way to try to squeeze more $ from people who are already paying top rate?
Either way, not a great look. | You don‚Äôt want me using your platform using my family‚Äôs account? Fine, I won‚Äôt use it at all. Remember blockbuster? You are next if you keep up this garbage. Keep pissing off your customers and see where it gets you. Greedy corporate goblins. | Add back ability to have multiple homes....this is absurd. If I spend a good part of my time on a seperate place's wifi, I should be able to watch Netflix there - especially at these prices. | I see why this policy was introduced but it‚Äôs actually ridiculous.

I‚Äôm a minor, i live with my mom and only see my dad on weekends, i use all of my dads streaming services including netflix; however i can‚Äôt use netflix while im with my mom which is the majority of the time. My mom doesn‚Äôt have netflix only my dad does. Since the policy i‚Äôve only been able to watch netflix at his house, which is CRAZY. there was NOTHING wrong with how netflix functioned before the policy, but now it‚Äôs so irritating. This policy is greedy and unnecessary, so what if people were sharing their accounts with friends? ITS THEIR ACCOUNT THAT THEY THEMSELVES PAY FOR? I know other reasons is like people stealing accounts but instead of robbing people of being able to share their accounts netflix could enforce their security. | From fall to now, there have been Quite A Few titles that don‚Äôt have audio description on Netflix but they do elsewhere. Please fix.

To start out with. I am blind. I have Paramount plus, which has a heading that they update every month that is titled Enjoy Before They‚Äôre Gone. And then it has a lot of the movies that will be leaving that month or the next month underneath. And then Tubi TV also has a heading like that titled Leaving Soon. On Netflix, when you‚Äôre blind you have to go through the movies that you might want to watch every month to see if they will be taken off that month. I was wondering if you would create a similar heading, or put the leaving soon titles underneath the New and Hot tab. I don‚Äôt think it would be hard to do. This would be greatly appreciated. For the Netflix original titles that leave, you should make sure the audio descriptions for those titles go with. For example Hemlock Grove had audio descriptions on Netflix but not on it‚Äôs new homes. Thank you for any consideration. | Yall should have never changed things recently. Especially with family not being able to watch(no they will not be purchasing it themselves because of this company‚Äôs pettiness and greediness) on top of the fact that the app itself has gone downhill in quite a few ways. The ONLY thing Netflix is doing right is no ads on the subscription we pay for. one more price increase or some bull when most of us have paid for this app for a good 10 years or more & I‚Äôm canceling companies need to stop taking advantage and being so greedy when the companies are VERY successful. | My family used to share our account with my poor old Gramma and not she has to pay for her own subscription. And you removed the Reputation Stadium Tour. And a bunch of Pok√©mon. AND REPLACED IT WITH @&$#ING COCOMELON. Nobody gives a $&@# about Cocomelon. Nobody. | What is the app for if I can‚Äôt watch anything outside of my home.. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not under the connected login WiFi‚Äù | yall doing too much for this | I finally cancelled my subscription after growing tired of price increases and poor content. Netflix now consists of an abundance old shows and movies. Follow up seasons for new shows are not available until several months later and there isn‚Äôt enough new content. | Netflix has become so greedy hungry the last couple of years, increasing the price and their household policy is ridiculous.",3.64498,383961,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/1f/dd/59/1fdd5935-325f-b1ac-f342-44af7e1320fd/24f14fbf-eab4-47cf-aadf-5f95e78f92e0_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/d3/b6/38/d3b638a7-6e9d-7a76-168c-158924f1f969/8e2eb0df-66d4-4a44-b465-4f7737d307d9_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7c/e6/ee/7ce6eed5-9b2c-8509-d2eb-294112b4a5ed/3c2301e0-fecd-4610-a160-d0451d523870_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/a5/bc/12/a5bc12e3-8e14-8f7e-9c23-7f8b1881c8a4/4a5e982b-f939-4d81-9c50-22fdd1890417_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/be/14/8b/be148b24-dce7-80cc-ddf4-3fbf78b32632/d2268d89-3bc1-4e98-ba54-cc5d12a3a9b2_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/96/09/70/960970f2-47d2-e9f5-5adc-017486e6e7c0/7b1d02ae-f62c-41da-ba80-a0b7f4feb788_6_APP_IPHONE_55_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/ce/67/d3/ce67d3b5-9ee4-689b-eaea-2273d04671ac/bc96586d-bc66-43f0-ab67-b4668e4845e3_7_APP_IPHONE_55_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/5d/3f/63/5d3f6374-9965-8503-8ace-9bedf60fda81/65e38411-9475-40b5-b150-1060e96c1a33_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/61/8b/f8/618bf87a-e44c-17bb-b50e-ea6dcee663cd/1264b29c-44a1-462a-9da0-44d85d8991c3_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e5/46/1d/e5461d2c-f499-0742-2a2e-4ceae7fd8c8d/11162bad-2714-414a-a1dc-180a7f117209_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Men living there life. | Spotify doesn‚Äôt really let you play your own music when you want and it doesn‚Äôt let you skip that‚Äôs why u give it a 1 star. | I love Spotify! I wish we could add audiobooks to more accounts than just manager account though! | This app has gone down hill. Before you were able to listen to a song. Now every time I try to find a song it keeps giving me the whole playlist or random song. You can‚Äôt pick unless ur premium. Which is straight out dumb. I don‚Äôt mind the ads but let me pick the song I want to hear!! | For years now, each time you try to add a song to a playlist, the list of playlists is completely out of order. Your sorting options don't even list ""custom order."" What kind of sick sadistic design is this? Why would you do this to your own customers? Is this some kind of social experiment, like Facebook a few years ago, changing their algorithm to see if they could increase depression? | I really like Spotify cus I can listen to my favorite songs and it really just help me express my feelings | Now this just happened out of nowhere and now I can‚Äôt fully of my songs :( | I love this vibe. Thankful to my friend Jonathon P. for turning me on to Jonathan!‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩüòäüé∂ | Spotify is a good app because, it has clean versions of songs for kids and I doesn‚Äôt turn of when your phone goes off. And you can make your own playlists to listen to! Spotify has my heart THANK YOU SPOTIFY!!! üü¢‚ö´Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | I love Spotify but when ever I search up a song it plays a totally different songs and I have to wait to listen to the song I originally wanted to listen to but other than that it‚Äôs a great app üòú | I really like you make this app I really love it thank you all of you I really appreciate üòä | It is the best music app ever I love it | This is a very good website you can watch/ listen to podcasts and listen to all types of music I highly recommend it 5 stars | ÿ°LOVE IT | The Apple Watch stopped streaming the downloaded music unexpectedly. Very inconvenient. | Just awesome | It is so good I listen to music at 3am | Amazing app I love itü´∂ | This is the best app ever created and I‚Äôm really thankful for the people that put in work of it THANK YOU | Thank god for Spotify but yall should of payed Joe Rogan more now he can play music on his pod üòÇ | So much playlists and i DEFINITELY recommend | There is beautiful clarity with proper bass,midrange,and treble. Thank you Spotify! | When u don‚Äôt have premium u can‚Äôt pick songs or rewind them and that‚Äôs really annoying | Great music app! Has many songs and podcasts. | can‚Äôt skip when i wanna skip | I love listening to Spotifys music. One thing I really like about it is that it has a lot of verities of music. | Spotify is clear listening to various genres. It clear as I use it in my car or at home. As long as I have T-Mobile coverage it functions perfectly. Keep up the good work. | Gives me adds after only two song would suggest for you like adds | Love him üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú | It helps me find pleasant music. | Spotify has all the songs, clean or dirty üòú. It fits every human being who like any type of music. Well, i don‚Äôt like how you have to pay or have an account to restart a song. Or when like you search up a song and the whole album comes up. Other than that, Spotify is amazing!! | From everything to anything and only ALL love ·•´·≠° always happy and vibin with Spotify | It says when I get an ad I have 30 mins of uninterrupted music and after 5 minutes I get 2 ads we only get 6 skips a hour and I only got 4 please fix | Bumping this for 2 years now. Not a single problem | This is my primary form of entertainment. The mobile app is regularly updated, and any bugs that get through are quickly fixed. When finances were more difficult I found the ability to switch between degrading to the free service with ads and then upgrading again to be a smooth transition the two times it‚Äôs happened. I forget how long I‚Äôve used it, but it‚Äôs been a few years. 

The downside is how the company operates and the ways they undercut artist financially. This is what makes me question keeping the service or seeking out an alternative to enjoy music. I‚Äôm not afraid to spend a ridiculous amount of money switching to CD, cassette, 8 track, and Vinyl, BUT I would prefer not too. | I have had Apple Music for years now and never could quite get the hang of it. I was looking for new music and Apple Music didn‚Äôt quite have the functionality to do so. A friend talked me into downloading Spotify and give it a shot. I had a full, new library within hours. I love how easy it was to ‚Äúsmart shuffle‚Äù my liked songs, to find new songs. My only complaint is that I wanted to be able to follow my friends and them follow me. I have tried every help forum I could find to resolve the issue I‚Äôm having, not being able to connect my Facebook account, but to no avail. It‚Äôs quite frustrating and I hope they fix this issue soon. | Too many ads, and I want to be able to play a single song not the other. When I play a artist, I just wanna hear that one artist, not similar | I waited 3 weeks for one as to end | I don‚Äôt know why but Spotify is just amazing something about it is just better than all other music apps especially YouTubemusic if you reading this download Spotify with no hesitation ps it sounds amazing with headphones üòã ps sorry my review sounds like an add | Would be nice to have all the new releases in one spot (not just the ones you think I like). Bring back Spotify from 5 years ago‚Ä¶ Apple Music is looking more enticing with every update y‚Äôall do | PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TURN OFF SUGGESTED AUDIOS AND STOP ADDING TO MY PLAYLIST PLEASE THIS IS THE WORST UPDATE PLEASE TIRN IT BACK PLEASE IM LISTENING TO SONGS I DONT EVEN LIKE PLEASE OTHER PEOPLE AGREE TOO PLEASE TURN OFF SUGGESTED SONGS FOR YOU OTHER THAN THAT SPOTIFY IS AMAZING JUST PLEASEEE TIRN OFF SUGGESTED MUSIC I LIVED SPOTIFY BEFORE IT IM BEGGING PLEASE. | I will say when I started using the free version it was still pretty great I mean except for if you had a specific order you would want to listen to your songs on but I think that would be an advantage for people who might want to feel nostalgic and listen to some songs they might have a year ago. But Spotify premium is totally worth it, I‚Äôm easily allowed to pick what genre of music I want to listen to in order on repeat for hours on hours and I use this app at least 5 hours every day of my life when I‚Äôm not with my boyfriend obviously but even then I‚Äôm allowed to have it on in the background with the adjustable volume accessible through the app. Overall 5 stars 10/10 muah chefs kiss and all you YouTube music Apple Music sound cloud hippie listeners needs to convert to this ü´µüòæ | If I don‚Äôt pay I can‚Äôt listen to music I want, it plays songs not even in my playlist?!! | This was a great app for music and I think I‚Äôm going to use it for the rest of my

We use Snapchat. | This app is really good, I find it entertaining and useful.
Snapchat allows for you to connect with Luther people without sharing personal information, like phone numbers. One of the biggest reasons for me to be using this app is because I can take lots of good pictures, I love the filters too, they are cute, I hope everyone can enjoy it. | Stop trying to be  instagram reels your are not funny | Re-downloaded this app and once again came to quickly realize how trashy and disgusting the developers/company is by trying to hack your lizard brain. All it tries to do (at least to males) is try to target them by sexualizing people and showing half naked video thumbnails for anyone to potentially click on to get hooked into an endless feed. And even worse -fake inspirational videos by these ‚Äúhard‚Äù men that are supposed to ¬ø¬øinspire?? potentially ‚Äúweak‚Äù men. 

Quite frankly, it‚Äôs just pathetic that there aren‚Äôt laws on this. I REALLY lean toward an open internet but this is just insanity. Maybe the algorithms just don‚Äôt know my taste yet so it‚Äôs just throwing whatever it can at me and seeing what sticks but cmon? I don‚Äôt need soft-core thrown at me every 3 videos or some dude on roids that says get after it. 

Deuces | Its difficult to take front facing vids and pics now without the volume rocker. Bring it back | Don‚Äôt you dare to say on it anythingüòå | Snapchat is fun overall, but a feature to quickly scroll to a certain date within a saved chat conversation would be stellar. | I‚Äôm sick of Snapchat pushing users to go PLUS. I don‚Äôt need the stupid AI bot jumping into my chats with my friends, I don‚Äôt care about the stupid snap streak, STOP IT! 

I will pay for basic Snapchat to come back! Just show me if they read my message, quit with the filters, stop supporting AI and chat bots, enough with the stories about the celebrities, just make basic Snapchat a thing again. 

I need to know if my friend read my message but all I see, is that we ‚Äúlost our streak‚Äù and need to pay to get it back. I DONT CARE!!! | I forgot my password and it‚Äôs stupid that I cannot change my password without deleting all my photos in there | On some of the people I follow 
They changed their handle and my Snapchat shows the old handle even though I update in the App Store.
How do I fix this | Faces are cool and love the app! | ever sonce they added ai and snap plus this app has gone so far downhill | i got banned because i got locked out of my account and people were using my account and when i brought the problem to snapchat help center they told me thrres jothing i can do about that | Nobody wants an Al what‚Äôs the point of having one | Snapchat used to be the king of ephemeral messaging, a place to share fleeting moments with a creative twist. But lately, it feels like the app is losing its identity, ditching the features that made it unique in favor of gimmicks and a cluttered interface. Bring back the features that made Snapchat special. Focus on refining the core experience instead of chasing trends. And for the love of all things social, get those ads under control. Otherwise, you risk losing what made you special and becoming just another forgettable app in a sea of mediocrity. | I‚Äôve had snap for about a year or more and I love it such a good way to connect but I‚Äôm not a big fan of the new Bitmoji update but still good | I like it I like it | This platform used to be enjoyable but now you can‚Äôt click on anything and watch it comfortably because there is a commercial every 2 seconds, and it‚Äôs always commercials about stupid stuff that u would never be interested in even purchasing, at the very least make the commercials about stuff that I would actually buy not a bunch of woke commercials | I love Snapchat because it‚Äôs really cool and you get to text your friends and save a lot of memories and your photos and I love it. I love how you can save memories. | SNAPCHAT LETS ME TALK TO MY BABY GURLS | U can meet now people and make friends | Took out the snap games which was a dumb move, but maybe yall could make an app where its the snapchat games so instead of it being in snap theres a separate app where its all snapchat games. | Why? Why keep your useless feature there if we never use it? This app just keeps adding more and more useless features to try and ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù with other apps that aren‚Äôt even competing with. Snapchat left its own lane years ago and has been going downhill ever since. Just stick to chat, pictures, and stories. You‚Äôre a messaging app not a full out social media | I keep getting push notifications from random  onlyfans creators when I have not ever interacted with them or any account in that industry | Keep Motivating the World Snapchat ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | I like the app but it has ads almost every 30 seconds so it makes it hard for you to focus on what you‚Äôre watching. The ads you can‚Äôt always skip as well. I really wish they could fix this issue. | it said my bugs were fixed then i could make a new acciunt and i did but then after practice it wouldnt let me back in | I‚Äôm going to get rid of Snapchat if they don‚Äôt take my privacy serious. I don‚Äôt want to
See suggested friends stories. Just stop. And the funny thing is is I kinda know the people too, how does Snapchat know this or is this a coincidence that over 30 people are suggested and I know them? Contacts and all data including location services is turned off for Snapchat yet, it still manages to find out info. | I love Snapchat you can chat with your friends watch videos make friends it‚Äôs so fun I highly request to get it | I love snapchat | Everything is great but I wish it would fit my I pad screen please. | I made a lot of friends with snapchat and most of them go to my school but i also met some new people and i got to know them and it‚Äôs a amazing app. | I‚Äôm scrolling up my messages with tones of pictures and then when it reaches a certain point it kicks me out and lags and it‚Äôs frustrating | I love it especially the filtersüëçüèΩ | It‚Äôs so annoying to try and respond to my top person, only to send my snap to the AI that I don‚Äôt want. | I wanna go MIA, can we just have a select all button to block everyone. Like please. | I love it I can get a hold of any of my friends | Bno | I can‚Äôt scroll down to see who viewed my story minimizing the story | Could we get no ads w snap plus or just in general? üò≠üôè | Snapchat‚Ä¶   I‚Äôve been a user on this app for many years now and there clearly has been a makeover from h*ll‚Ä¶ First, please bring back the ability to choose the kind of avatar you want. I like my bitmoji look so much more than the animated one we have now.  Secondly, please stop pushing the Snapchat+ on every single screen in the app, once i select close and X thats that. Third thing, please stop forcing the AI features on to our chat log. I do not want to use it and I‚Äôd like to remove it from my list,  at least let it unpin it from the top and let it be. 
Please consider everything i‚Äôve listed above. I believe that the changes would improve the app greatly. | It‚Äôs good | my Snapchat has been permanently banned from my phone. I did not do anything my account repeatedly got reported for no reason and now my phone is unable to open any account on Snapchat no matter what account it is I cannot open it because my whole entire phone is banned. I am very disappointed in Snapchat for allowing this.

RARELY do my orders come within 2 days or on Time at all. Prime is not worth it. Save your money | My package got delivered to someone else‚Äôs house and I get no refund!!!!üò°üò° | I have made several attempts to reach out to customer service in regards to my account being hacked. Not only is your one 800 number for Amazon customer service unavailable. But the chat is not available as well. I made an attempt to purchase tennis shoes the Adidas ultra boost and had them delivered on 14 February on 15 February I went into the email and complete the purchase. I had received the confirmation Mail stating thank you for making this purchase. For the ultra boost and I closed out email and account now all of a sudden the purchase did not go through and you keep telling me to go online in the browser and enter my card number, which I am not doing. back in November another purchase that I placed was canceled and the seller of the product told me to go into my browser and enter my credit card information which I am not doing so. I don‚Äôt know what kind of scams you‚Äôre running, but I uninstalled my Amazon until someone can call me to clear this up. I will not update this review until someone reaches out to me. | I ODER A BRACELET IT SHOULD HAVE 2900 BEANS IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH FOR ONE BRACELET IT WHEN I TRY TO PUT IT ON THE BROKE AND DIDN'T LOOK THE SAME WHAT I ODER | I tried to fix my payment method and it took seven people and they still have yet to fix it for me because it won‚Äôt let me change it if you want to take the risk then it‚Äôs somewhat worth it but if you ever need to fix something and go through customer service, it is horrible | Excelente | I feel so disgusted, I was looking on the inspire part of the app and found a video of someone showing their outfit literally had the camera facing her bottom half no undergarments mind you! I did report it but seriously Amazon! That‚Äôs disturbing and disgusting that video was even allowed on there! | This app not working | I have ordered just about every odd thing you could think of and you have it | App was great. Now difficult to use. Slow to load nothing works well | I‚Äôm happy to say that when our time comes to renew Amazon prime, we will not be. The app constantly tells me that I get two day shipping however most of the time it turns into four days or more. The video content on the streaming app doesn‚Äôt even come close to making up for amazons lack of ability to follow through and we hardly even open the streaming app. Purchases are made based on arrival of an item. Every time they say it shipped then two days later say it hasn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs delayed. I‚Äôll order directly off of a company‚Äôs website instead. I‚Äôve trusted Thai company too many times and have been disappointed too many times. | Needs a dark feature. Too bright at do my shopping at night :p | Crazy Cathy | I like the app it helps, but the problem is every time it‚Äôs a holiday or something that I really need at the moment it‚Äôs delayed, like my daughters present for her birthday today it was suppose to come today but it didn‚Äôt and now she thinks we forgot all about her birthday | Note: I‚Äôve deleted the app & reinstalled and noise glitch still happens. Annoying. Fix it. No other apps do this. BTW- Sound glitch also occurs with M1 iPad with iPadOS 17.4

Glitches occur going into Amazon app and when leaving it to go to another app | Apparently amazon is so broke they try to charge me for a 30 day free trial. then locks my account. done with amazon overall. customer support is horrible. horrible overall. | Amazon became just a plain Rats fried  rice in a TRASH CAN. MADE IN CHINA MEGA EXPENSIVE GARBAGE PRODUCTS(THEFT) | Every single day my husband and I get packages from Amazon, it's just so easy to order everything here. I love  amazon‚ù§Ô∏è | The app has gotten slightly more intuitive. I can finally find things like my subscriptions and account info more easily. But what happened to being able to search an item‚Äôs reviews?!?! | A Lot of 3rd party companies that are on amazon are getting the products they are selling from DISCOUNT STORES. Look on discount stores website and you‚Äôll save much more then if you buy on amazon. | I love every book she writes. I have almost two hundred of her books. | Almost all of my use of Amazon is for Kindle and Audible. I HATE that I can‚Äôt purchase either of them through this app and can‚Äôt purchase ANY kindle books through ANY apps, I have to use the browser. It‚Äôs just not a very streamlined set of apps | They carry a large variety of products at competitive prices. | If you do not have prime not recommend to use it. They promise 5-8 busniess days for one of package and i am waiting for a month for getting my package. Their app is punish cotumers. I really do not like shopping from here. I feel like they want to sell things only foe prime customers! So should check another companies. | I order craft supplies and clothes mostly
I am delighted with most items, I rarely return anything, but it is quick and easy | About 95% of the Amazon app is fantastic. One area that could use some help is the low video resolution from posted customer reviews. | They can‚Äôt do the job, the app is a buggy mess. I am pretty lenient on this type of stuff. But it‚Äôs been   A frequent occurrence where I can‚Äôt even buy anything from the app because of the bugs. | After after a year the app is buggy, intermittent shutdown, in general it slow and very unresponsive. Maybe Jeff Bazos should spend less playing and look in the poor management team that lets this happen!!!‚Äô | Can‚Äôt uphold guaranteed shipping times. Half of the deliveries are late since the start of this year. Once they‚Äôre late you cannot cancel until it is delivered if it makes the item useless to you or you need the money to buy the item at a store because you still need it on time. Customer service is a joke. | Amazon fulfillment keeps shipping items improperly causing damage to the product. Use a cardboard box, not everything can go in a plastic shipping bag, fragile items need protection, basic packing 101. DAX8, SBD2 needs to learn how to pack and ship. When we call in to report this we receive no help, the customer service reps are terrible, rude, and could care less about the customer. | I have an order coming in with 5 items. My orders tab only shows me 3 items. The only way I can see the rest of the items in the order if I go to my subscribe and save tab. | This entire organization lacks the capacity to provide any type of service and is the opposite of offering meaningful support. It‚Äôs sellers and packers are little more than low-life, opportunistic egoists. It manipulates reviews and needs to pay more than the back taxes and definitely more than money. It‚Äôs only a vehicle for halfwits who need to take a backseat since they won‚Äôt think before doing. | Horrible. It used to be amazing but now when browsing the pictures for items become a nightmare !!! Fix the problems with your app!! üôèüôè | Dark mode please. I‚Äôm tired of having to look at negative images in order to shop in dark mode. | Easy to fine stuff | I ordered several clothing items tonight that came out to $15.98 but when I got to checkout the shipping and handling was over $147! I was able to get thru and speak to an Amazon rep who assured me that after I put the order thru they would take off the shipping and handling, sounds suspicious to me but I have purchased many items from Amazon before with no problems- will keep you guys informed | Amazon has made all of our lives easier and I‚Äôve had great experiences with customer service, but for the past month or so the app is just not working well. It is glitchy, freezes, and won‚Äôt let me view product images. I‚Äôve closed the app and not purchased something multiple times because of this. Please fix it! | Love the app but they added ‚Äúcommunity guidelines‚Äù have to spend $50 when I already did that multiple times! Smh.. üôÑüôÑ | i dont need the apologies, i need my problems to be solved, everything was awful | It‚Äôs been very buggy lately. It freezes, pauses, you can‚Äôt press certain colors or sizes. Fix this! | My peeps haven‚Äôt come yet I order them they are coming April 1 and I was supposed to take pictures with them | They need to issue refunds more quickly I had over 150 dollars of items not delivered or stolen. | This app fails over and over to provide any sort of real help. Only lets you choose prewritten questions that get you absolutely no where. Find it unacceptable Billion dollar businesses choose the easy way out of things. Don‚Äôt download | I hate it | When you absolutely need help, you can never get it. It send you back to the purchase page with out a telephone number, text, or even Siri. There used to be no problem at all. Now the problem is relentless! | From an array of fantastic finds and prices plus great driver service I would recommend Amazon to everyone. | New app is terrible. I can‚Äôt get a list of my orders the way it use to be. Why did they change it. Amazon needs to leave things alone. | Can you please make it faster to switch between business and personal accounts. It‚Äôs a nightmare trying to remember where to do it and it‚Äôs in 2 different places. Just let me quickly switch the profile or delivery location. Just make it simple, please! | My package was shipped for like three days and it got lost | This app need to go to! It‚Äôs not a great app to shop on. They will cancel your order when you ask about the shipping. customer. Service is no help!!. AND THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY.

They also have ‚Äòfree with ads‚Äô videos. Seems there‚Äôs no much difference. I think people need to step forward and give chance to other companies that do a better job when it comes to trust. Giving 1 star cause there is no 0. | If you use AirPlay with a hotspot just save your time. They are the only streaming service to add extra steps to make it nearly impossible to simply play what‚Äôs on your phone on the screen because of comcast. Garbage product. | So I was lured into Prime Video because it is one of only a few streaming apps they have a few of my fav shows. I put up the 15$ for the subscription and an additional 3$ to run ad free. Everything was going well until I start watching my shows only to find out that only a few season are available to be watched and I would have to buy or rent the other seasons. For the kinda of money they ask for monthly/annual I shouldn‚Äôt have to put up more money. Be prepared that getting the subscription does not guarantee you will be able to get all of your favorite shows | You changed how your app works and i pay a subscription and i get ads. This is dumb and im sure a lot of people are also mad about this You take my money to make me watch pointless ads | This is my minor don‚Äôs phone. He has a history of severe trauma and has been in , in -patient treat for three years.
 Eva use of your greed, he was able to open an Amazon account linked with mine and charge it to $960 worth of 
 computer, gaming, steering wheel equipment.
As an Educator of 28 years, I am appalled.
As a parent of a Special Needs child, your practice is utterly disgraceful.
When I spoke with Customer Service, no assistance in terms of refund. 
The items he purchased were never delivered, or perhaps stolen.
Consequently, I have closed my Amazon Prime Account and will do no further business with you.
Your company is in violation of Anti-Trust Laws, not to mention, Child Exploitation. | The ui on this app is horrible | Too many ads. Needs some balancing. | Who adds ads to a paid service. Its greed clear and simple. Guess I‚Äôm done watching the shows that you were mostly ruining anyways. | Ninguna de las pel√≠culas que quiero las puedo ver porque no tienen subt√≠tulos no me gusta as√≠ por eso dos estrellas uno paga no es gratis | I‚Äôve been watching Prime Videos via my many iPhones through an Apple HDMI adapter to my TV for years without issue!  Suddenly nothing will play.  I even subscribed to the Ad free TV and this is what I get?  A useless viewing experience if I don‚Äôt want to hold my iPhone up to my face for hours?  FIX THIS AMAZON! | The interface is awful. At least half of the titles shown require paying more even if you have Prime. I paid for Prime for a year and they started forcing in ads 6 months into it. Asking my state Attorney General if that‚Äôs legal. You should ask yours. | What happened, I have the quality set as best and it‚Äôs not even HD. This is just garbage. Want to start invincible season 2 but you could blatantly see the low bitrate. Fix this asap. Just makes it not watching anything | I‚Äôve noticed things we‚Äôre available on Amazon prime until I started watching them I‚Äôve watched the first season of GOT then all of a sudden you only had to pay for season 2 episodes 1 to continue. The I started watching the chosen and after season 1 I had to up grade for season 2.
Then after that simple show like modern family and Ricky and Morty needed an up grade. What am I paying 14.99 for ? Why would I just not get Hulu or hbo max ext if I‚Äôm going to have to pay extra for it on Amazon anyway. It‚Äôs a rip off stay with the regular providers they just take your 14.99 and ask you to pay for shows that they claim are included but in reality nothing is actually included. Your paying a membership fee like if you where at blockbuster and get nothing for it and have to pay more to watch actual programming | Why am I paying for this platform if I'm going to constantly watch long commercials in the middle of the movie? im ya birüëéüëéüëéüëé | Even though it says you CAN, it forces me to download the app onto my iPad. | Their ads on the free version are far to greedy and played far too often. For a company this big when I already pay monthly fees, this shouldn‚Äôt have this many commercials. | Can‚Äôt download a movie but can watch constant ads | I can confidently say I DID NOT subscribe just so I can watch your ads. What a horrible expereience! | Cant believe we are paying to also get ads. By far one of the worse examples of corporate greed. | Why am I getting ads for !! | I like it how do you add the TV show Batman in the movie ninja turtles I love that and I hope you add more movies in your business. this is one of my favorite app I watched it every day and I am so glad that I have this app. This is one of my favorites I mean it.üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ | Post episodes immediately 
Or refund me my money for the year 
So here‚Äôs how u keep my money 
At 2 am the episodes drop and go online or I‚Äôm not keeping the survive 

Do better or shut down | I have had nothing but trouble with my prime subscription. I pay it every month and never get to watch it. When I try to watch they constantly boot me out. I have paid even double some months and still can‚Äôt watch. They are so hard to reach. | Six ads in a row all bc I wanted to re-read subtitles. Backed up 10 secs once got me 4 ads, AND THEN after ad 4 the episode restarted on me and played me 2 more ads when I went back to the scene I was previously at. | I fell asleep while watching an episode of a Amazon show on my TV and then I went back to finish watching it.  However I couldn‚Äôt rewind the episode because it just wanted to play the next episode and there was no START OVER icon as there was for the next episode.  I had to use my computer in order to rewind with the mouse. | So I paid for a year subscription without commercials and now I have commercials. Breach of contract. F you bezos. | Not sure when you guys added ads that can‚Äôt be skipped for people who PAY FOR PRIME. Seems a bit unnecessary to charge for a service and still have the audacity to fill it with more ads. | Bsidb | K
Like ten add when it not even freevee | There are things that Prime Video needs to improve to be more like Netflix. 

1. Most of Netflix series/movies have multiple languages for audio and close caption. 
2. Most of Netflix series/movies are new. 
3. The technology of Netflix‚Äôs series/movies is of higher quality that Prime‚Äôs. 

The only thing Netflix doesn‚Äôt provides is free shopping deliveries. Maybe Netflix needs to start doing this. If that happens. I‚Äôll cancel Prime Video. | Just expressing my opinion, ads ruined prime for me. Prime membership went up and then they add ads and ask for more money to remove ads. Just not right. I‚Äôm not happy about it. | Uninstalling and canceling Prime. Netflix for the win | 1. I don‚Äôt like that I have to buy stuff just to watch somthing
2. When it says it‚Äôs like 20 dollars just to buy something you try other payment options and it shows it again but cheaper | If I had a choice to give you 0 stars, I would. | Can play movies. Amazon has the rights to a lot of them. That‚Äôs about it. Watch them dark as henk on mobile, because you can‚Äôt adjust brightness. Needs quality of life overhaul for sure. | Am I not paying for this? Now we have 2 minute ads? And for Prime? Like the least useful streaming platform? | Worst UX while projecting on TV | Messed up putting ad‚Äôs on ur paid app to begin with greedy people. But its even worse when you cant rewind a video without having to go back through ad‚Äôs to the highest bidder. | Figures you guys would cancel ‚ÄúShelter ‚Äú knowing how much fans loved the series but I guess that‚Äôs what you do. | after i already pay for Prime? will be giving lowest review i can everywhere i can and will be canceling membership. i dont use it often enough to deal with ads, or pay more to remove them. amazon is just a vampire, cant get enough blood can you? | Making me watch ads everytime I seek/skip forward (even when I haven't even watched any of the video) is infuriating. | Stop asking me to change my address every time I  open your app. This is new. It‚Äôs a roadblock for me. It‚Äôs like slamming me into a wall. I WILL TELL YOU WHICH ADDRESS TO USE WHEN I CHECK OUT. 

I already have contempt for Amazon. Don‚Äôt make it worse. | They switched everyone to begin to have adds without giving a cheaper option for adds and they have been stringing along the invincible show to keep subscribers | Used to be good then they added ads.

Be careful folks. | Beautiful stories | You segments aren‚Äôt long enough and cost too much for that little time. I‚Äôll finish this episode but I will not be returning. | I was watching The Double Life of My Billionaire Husband, I was hooked until it made me paid $20 for credits or $20 for a 1 week subscription. I chose the credits thinking it would last longer.  I couldn‚Äôt even finish the series with that, so I had to spend another $20 just to finish 5 mins and the series ended.  That‚Äôs more than an entire movie! | I am loving all of the shows. The anticipation is nerve-racking to get to the next part. | The stories in the videos are good. The only problem is they give you only 5 chances to watch a video in exchange to watch a chapter but it‚Äôs limited to 5 a day so if you watch 5 videos for 1 book that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ I understand the concept to make money to support by offering to pay for coins, but watching ads in exchange for a chapter should not be limited especially if you want to keep people on your app.. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Love adds that help me win points to watch my next episode. | Great Show | Storylines are so good | This app is great | Love it | Great selection | I think the storyline in everything is actually really good. I don‚Äôt care how cheap the acting looks. I really enjoyed it! I just think it‚Äôs too expensive. Well actually not too expensive but it‚Äôs a bit much, but I guess if you go with a equivalent to a book reading it‚Äôs about the same. I just wish I could skip it on some places but not all actually no, I like it. I guess I‚Äôm a bit confused lol, I love the book I love the storyline I love the whole shebang. I love it all. | Great stuff here! | Jarred Harper !!good job I like the stories you play in . I love the leading ladies as well . Thank you . | A cada rato que entro y trato de ver los video para ganar bonos, dice que no est√°n disponibles, que vuelva m√°s mande, lo hago, cierro y abro la app y nada‚Ä¶ sigue sin funcionar üëé | I paid 4.99 to watch one of the shows. It said I bought 500 coins and it‚Äôs only 50 for show. It cut me out after a few scenes asking for more money. It try‚Äôs to hook you so you do the full subscription. 4.99 is reasonable for 1 show full | The ads every minute or so are terrible! I understand needing to make a profit but every minute?! And because they are so often, the first 5 seconds of every minute is the last 5 seconds of the previous minute. You can only watch 10 a day unless you pay. I paid thinking I would just cancel next month‚Ä¶ the fee is per week! So make sure you are paying attention to that. I am about to cancel now but it asked me to rate the app or watch new episodes of something I didn‚Äôt want to watch without giving me an option to exit so here we are. | Advertisement trap! | Love the stories | I like the app the episodes are just too short especially since they have to be paid for | The reason for the 3 stars is due to how expensive it is to watch these episodes as it is ridiculous and unaffordable for some of your viewers. 

I did enjoy the alpha and I would like to continue however unaffordable | First time in a long time the cast was picked perfectly, the two stars really look good together | Should not have to pay to read a book and so expensive | Good story line but money pit. Once pay should be able to see at least one story without asking for another payment. If you don‚Äôt pay you don‚Äôt get access. That‚Äôs my only complaint. I enjoy the story line. | soo good ! | Amazing!!! | This app is quite expensive for such short skits | This app costs more to watch a show than a monthly subscription to Netflix. Such a waste of money! | Por q no se pueden ver gratis si bajamos la aplicaci√≥n para disfrutarlo y sin monedas no se permite de verdad qued√© desilusionada por completo es una pena gracias por nada desde PUERTO RICO üáµüá∑ üíîüò≠ | Love the stories but hate that I have to pay to finish | I don‚Äôt like how coins increase for episodes after being bought. I wish there was a way to pay for one full story. | I love watching them.. they are pretty good | I don‚Äôt appreciate buying about 3 minutes for $5. I think that should by the entire book. 

I like the story line. However, will never t continue to pay those rates. | Downloaded it a couple of hours ago.  Removing now.  Not worth the hassle.  I can subscribe to a streaming service for a month for what they want to watch a low budget movie. | The price is ridiculesly to much to watch one movie | Wish the parts was longer then a minute | Episodios cortos para lo que cuesta, pero igual estoy obsessed | Too much | Hermosa historia | Once you start, you can't stop. I love the stories here. | I actually like the series | I was really interested in the story - but then it got too hard to watch clips, with long ads literally every minute. I don‚Äôt want to watch something I have to work so hard for. So whatever. | I love being able to watch reels on my phone.. great stories.. | I love the content. I hate I had to pay to finish it. I say ‚Äúhad‚Äù bc I was hooked on the story and didn‚Äôt want to wait for the free unlocked episodes or watch a bunch of ads. Besides, the episodes aren‚Äôt that long and you spend more time waiting and watching than you actually spend on the episodes that have been unlocked. So, I chose to pay to finish the story. | This app has a lot of potential, the shows they have are decent at best. Just charge a monthly subscription and allow full access which is what most streaming services are doing. Avoid this app if possible unless you want to waste time on watching adds and waiting full 24 hours for next round of limited views. | Videos are too short and they make you pay anywayNot happy the

And it‚Äôs not user error because I can be watching the map and it just switch on me as soon as I pull into the parking lot! Please fix this issue! | When using McDelivery, the app should show which McDonald's (store) you're ordering from so you can order from your preferred store. I hate using McDelivery and the app send my order to a different McDonald's - that I do not like. ü§¨üôÑ | Need a section where to add condiments! | Great low priced food 
Yummyyyy | Love the deals | Love this app now I can order with out someone saying they can‚Äôt hear me cuz I yell to softly üò≠. 
No but truly that way I don‚Äôt have to wait in line. | I love it when it works!! | Still expensive.  Missed the good old days | Idiot developers clearly designed this as an asynchronous app that doesn‚Äôt actually confirm the code is valid server side, hence the constant complaints ""that code doesn‚Äôt work"" at McDonald‚Äôs you visit; this outsourced team needs to be fired and new team who actually uses the product needs to be hired in their place. So tired of this madness. | I used to be logged in and it worked great. Then I was logged out and I can't get back in again. When I use my email address, I'm emailed a link that doesn't work. When I try to login via Google, it says I need to use my email address (which is at Google). I have a good number of points so this is really annoying. | For weeks now, even after updating and uninstalling and reinstalling I haven‚Äôt had the typical deals my peers apps show as available.
Specifically, the 99 cent coffee.

Started going to Wendy‚Äôs instead! | Honestly it works really well it‚Äôs simple and makes my mornings a lot easier | actively using location in the background 24/7, even has the blue indicator like you‚Äôre getting navigation from a map app. When tapping the indicator, you re-open the mcdonalds app. The app shouldn‚Äôt be actively using my location 24/7, draining my battery and effectively spying on me. Not even a little bit worth it, the coupons or the price in general. Edit: you don‚Äôt need to use my precise location all the time in order for me to know to open the app at mcdonalds. It‚Äôs creepy to know you‚Äôre watching my every move so you can pop up an intrusive notification when I‚Äôm at mcdonalds. You‚Äôre draining my battery because the mode you use is actively using the gov CONSTANTLY. You see the location icon 24/7, and when you tap on it (thought I left my navigation going) it takes you to the McDonald‚Äôs order page. I do not like the invasiveness, battery drain, and the fact that I have to use your creepy app to get regular fast food prices, instead of your new pricing that makes some local restaurants seem cheap by comparison. How about McDonald‚Äôs stays in their lane, makes a simple restaurant app, and doesn‚Äôt act like they‚Äôre entitled to my whole life for $1 off a $16 Big Mac‚Ä¶

Edit: I‚Äôm happy my iPhone reminds me that mcdionalds is tracking my every move, I‚Äôll be sure to use an android in the future so I can use a mock location app and tell McDonald‚Äôs I‚Äôm in the ocean until I‚Äôm ready to eat. Though I‚Äôll probably also start disabling the app when I‚Äôm not ordering food, which SHOULD be the default on every phone. Screw it, I‚Äôm making my own phone, so I‚Äôll also open a burger chain that doesn‚Äôt get all date-rapey about buying a burger‚Ä¶ | Why would the point expires why isn‚Äôt it like any other app so we can save our points until the time we want to use them and not being forced to use them. | For years we‚Äôve been coming to McDonald‚Äôs. My father is 96. His friend is 93 and the other is 64. They walk 2 miles to get coffee every day.
For some reason the McDonald‚Äôs here in Foster city has decided to not have Wi-Fi service any longer. I would strongly encourage you to restore the Wi-Fi service.

why do these elderly people in myself have to go without Wi-Fi service in this day and age.? | One would expect a huge corporation like McDonald's to have an easy to use app.  Nope.  They make it difficult to use deals and points, change your mind, and delete things from your cart, or back out of the cart to shop for more items.  Customer happiness seems to be a thing of the past. Sad. | Time consuming app with too many steps and not quick or intuitive. Crashed on me an had to delete it and so I lost my prior points earned. | Easy to use, love earning point for free food. | I love the McDonald‚Äôs app makes getting everyone‚Äôs order super easy.  Only problem I have with it is there are no light ice, light cream, light sugar, light ketchup etc options! It is very aggravating having to get the employees to stop and listen so I can adjust things. | The app kept changing the restaurant for pick up to another restaurant.  I was in the parking lot of the restaurant I wanted and the app switched and sent my order to the further away restaurant. McDonald‚Äôs, a million dollar restaurant will make me work for the credit like they did last time. I had to go to the restaurant because the corporate office wouldn‚Äôt refund the money.  Corporate gave me a phone number for the restaurant that was out of service that time. That time the app charged my card twice because it dropped and closed for now reason.  Well McDonald I sent correspondence demanding my money back.  If I have to go to the restaurant or my bank to get this mthing net back I am filing a report with CT Depaetment of Gonsumer Protection.   Oh yeah and the app 3,000 rewards points for an order that was never sent to the restaurant.  Guess business is that bad when customers are constantly being taken advantage of. | very inconsistent sometimes, missing food, sloppy sandwiches, overall good. We ask for extra ketchup through the drive-through and they handed us a small brown bag of ketchup packets. Probably had 50 catchup in there. | Good deals | Somehow the location got changed by the app between the time I started an order and when I placed it. Did not notice until I got to the restaurant. This app needs to allow for changes or cancellations after an order is placed. Chick-fil-a has a much better app and food! | Don‚Äôt live the closing of dining room so early | They promote the app everywhere but wont update the terrible lag and glitches it has but i mean i guess it works just feels like I'm on the first computer ever | I only wished that after an order is placed it can be changed or items added to it. | Consistent as always. | Very good and always fresh | The app is awesome, makes  life easier for everyone. | Excelente ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Nice place to eat always good service 10/10 | Too the appop | Buena atenci√≥n y deliciosa comida | I live a bit of a long walk from McDonald so have tried to place order and do pay when close. Used to work fine but now it needs you to reenter payment and at least half the time the app freezes. So you try and restart app and sometimes it reopens to that order but sometimes to a previous order. I try to use coupon/deal and last order never closed so now that coupon is no good but can't use a new coupon because coupon is still attached (even though it is no longer valid). Or else it just appears coupon never took and says you can't a second and again app freezes.  You still need to confirm location multiple times.  You end of with multiple ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù but don't know the details so you select the wrong one and edit it (which never works).

I stillteyiton occasionbut find it much easier to just order at counter or at the kiosk | Worst app ever sent me to one location then when I arrived they did not have my order I went inside the app rebooted and changed the location to across town to the worst McDonalds. | Using the app is a great idea.  And super thanks to ‚ÄúIda‚Äù for helping me figure out how to use it!   
Ida is always cheerful and helpful | McLuvn it!! | Perfect | Every time I order with the app I ask for the same thing, no onions and no pickles‚Ä¶ and guess what is ALWAYS on my sandwich‚Ä¶ ONIONS AND PICKLES!! It doesn‚Äôt matter the store location. Can they not see it in the stores??? üòÇ | McDonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt read these, but I deleted the app and stopped eating there because of how much money they sent to destroy Palestinian children. If a company is too stupid to know the value of human life, I‚Äôll just buy French fries elsewhere. | Love the technology and friendly service. | It is 2024 and this app doesn‚Äôt yet support Face ID, which is a problem because it frequently prompts me to sign in again (Sign in with Apple). it seems like every time I open this app I am signed out (even though I have never signed out and leave it running). And the app is often so slow. Getting to the barcode takes an eternity sometimes because it has to ‚Äúphone home‚Äù. Also, like the kiosks themselves, this app has horrible UX design. I question if McDonalds ever tested either with real customers. | Must haveüòá | Will automatically change your store when checking out. It‚Äôs too easy to order the same thing twice, pretty sure it‚Äôs done on purpose (poor design). | Burger | half the time payment doesn‚Äôt work. | I‚Äôd give up many things for him. Luckily he just wants my money. Praise Ronald. | ‚ù§Ô∏è | It keeps saying the items in my basket are unavailable. Support told me to reinstall it but that doesn‚Äôt work either. Also, this app drained my phone one night.",4.80962,3906638,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6f/8e/30/6f8e30d2-9fc1-59c1-fa35-50cb0d8e9a7b/b28364fe-bb62-4368-9378-2153c033c2b4_Image1_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2e/1e/50/2e1e5071-cbef-c8e8-02a1-5d4404bc24de/a19aea51-0934-4dcf-8128-e9119a05ef85_Image2_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f6/06/17/f6061789-f61e-5095-1915-944ff7c73d53/35ddf8ac-16d2-4b5a-a610-9951ea0c0325_Image3_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/f3/08/a7f30845-1584-c272-50f0-7402dd816825/9d4177ec-b31b-4040-a2a5-00551d55e959_Image4_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/49/58/26/4958266a-e1b3-1100-2d44-9c4fd5d0412a/632500dd-991c-4f20-9552-929d1edab2b2_Image5_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

When a user opens the app and selects remote, it doesn‚Äôt recognize a device to connect to. The user then has to go to the device‚Äôs tab and pick a device.

1. Most people only have one roku so it should auto select that one and connect to it without additional taps

2.  The Roku app should remember the last device it connected to and automatically reconnect to that one.

Leaving that page every single time to connect to the only device in my house is annoying enough to not use the app and ask Alexa to start my shows. | Roku is so easy | Why is it every other update that they release is worse than the one before? It can‚Äôt even connect to my devices, even if I disconnect my vpn. | Thanks for being gay | Either you need perfect wifi for this or the app just doesn‚Äôt work 70% of the time | This is the best app I have a Roku | I lost my remote so I downloaded Roku for my tv and I have to turn my tv on from the side but it shows you can turn it on from the app but it may be a glitch | The main purpose for this app is to act as a remote to control your tv. It fails miserably. Doesn‚Äôt connect to the tv. When it does connect it disconnects when you put your phone down. This is an absolutely piece of junk. I don‚Äôt know how the development team thought this all was ready to go to market. | Horrible app I don't know why the people that make the apps don't say ""You have to pay to use everysingle button on this app"" there's no point in this app. 

Sorry for the bad review but paying to use buttons on a remote is too far. | Roku is terrible. Slow. And screen casting is nearly impossible with a iPhone. | I was very happy and would highly recommend to anyone. | Since I‚Äôve been using Roku, it‚Äôs been so amazing because I don‚Äôt have to look for a remote. I can just press on Roku Roku app for being the best. | The best! | It‚Äôs one of a kind very happy to have a Roku TV and the app on my phone for the remote üî•üî•üî• | Downloaded this so I could use the remote portion to connect my headphones and not bother the house at night when I‚Äôm up late watching TV.
The TV and my phone are connected to the same router. There‚Äôs no near identical WiFi that‚Äôs 2.5 vs 5. I have quadruple checked.
I have tried EVERYTHING, resetting my TV, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, you name it I‚Äôve tried it, I‚Äôve even read back to front their help guide, which is apparently useless for whatever is wrong here.
The app refuses to recognize there is a Roku device connected to my internet. It refuses to acknowledge that my TV exists on the same WiFi.
I had zero issues with Roku in general before, and am now beyond disappointed. 
If it works for you, great.
But if it doesn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt waste hours trying to fix something on your end when it looks like this apps just completely broken. | We have a two and Roku tvs 
Both of them are giving us separate issues 
One doesn‚Äôt turn on and the other one the remote isn‚Äôt paired any longer, plus the Roku app won‚Äôt work properly so I can use my phone with the tv as a remote control. | 22 | The remote feature used to work reliably but now it‚Äôs extremely spotty. This is an issued that needs to be fixed. It‚Äôs been going on now for over a year. | At first when I got the tv it had no problems but now it never wants to connect | Doesn‚Äôt work. Won‚Äôt connect to my Roku TV. The last Roku TV I bought will be the last one that I buy. F Roku. | I HATE THIS | I only really use this so I can troll my brothers | Tv | The thing that I like most about this app is that there are barely any ads when using the remote. | Love it | The app will not connect with Roku‚Ä¶ worked well once upon a time and nothing changed‚Ä¶ tried uninstalling, unplugging, reinstalling checked network and no luck‚Ä¶ fun while it lasted | Add VOLUME BUTTON & I‚Äôll rate 5 star. | Roku is set OG streaming service‚Ä¶. | This app is amazing! There was no Bluetooth headphones capability, with my Roku tv, which was annoying and disappointing.

I‚Äôm so grateful the app has the remote, which gives me the Bluetooth headphones option! | The best | I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd get rid of my Apple TV but it really hate trying to figure out how to setup and  use my Roku. | You don‚Äôt even offer a Disagree button? Do better. | Now every time I got to use the remote the search keyboard pops up and even when I click done and get out of it.. I can‚Äôt use the remote at all. None of the buttons function.. the keyboard light stays lit green no matter what I do | Really good.. | Think you guys might have a bug the internet goes out as entering the app | Not allowing me to get on apps | Ever since misplacing my remote to the tv this app has been amazing, I can control everything like an actual remote and the app also gives recommendations on shows and movies. It has honestly been amazing. | I haven‚Äôt been able to even use the app for almost a year because it simply won‚Äôt connect to any of my ROKU devices. | I‚Äôve Been Excited to Watch My Roku TV Again But, I Seem to Be having Difficulty Setting it Up So I May Try to have A Relative Jelp Me With that So, that I Can Enjoy it Again, ü•∞ | This app no longer connects to my Roku TV. I‚Äôve checked the Wi-Fi connections for both, power cycled them, and all other trouble shooting options I can find, but it never connects. | You need to make the voice command be able to go into apps like Disney+ and other apps and make were it auto connects because I can not connect it with my tv and i tried a million times to connect. | It can never find my device. | I‚Äôve have been dealing with an issue where my wifi will just not work on my Roku for some reason. I‚Äôll restart it, turn it on and off, plug it out the wall even move it closer to the wifi box and STILL I happens literally once a month. I wouldn‚Äôt had use a word such as strong as hate if it weren‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been going through this problem ever since I got the thing which was 3-4 years ago. One top of the that the remote app hasn‚Äôt worked for me properly in MONTHS. I‚Äôve had to delete and reinstall the app more the 5 times just to pause the show. I‚Äôll change my rating when I‚Äôm not playing a lottery game with someone who wants to fool me. | Roku app is updated and it keeps not wanting to connect to my tv tried installing uninstalling signing out signing back in nothing works. I only have one wifi network which my tv and phone is connected to and still does not work. | One star bc I try multiple
 times to connect my tv so I do not recommend | Dude | YALLLLL I WAS DYING  üò© WHEN I HAD NO BATTERIES FOR MY ACTUAL  ROKU  REMOTE LIKE  I'M SADD THEY GOT ME LIKEüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è INTO THE WILDERNESS  UNTIL  ü´£ üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è OMG ROKU  HAS A  APP I WAS LISTENING TO  BLACKPINK üñ§BLŒõ∆ÜKPI–òKüíó BOOMBAYAH Ngl üíú·ó∑TS‚ü≠‚ü¨üíúu are my least fav (‚óû‚Ä∏‚óü„ÜÄ)À¢·µí ≥ ≥ ∏ BUTTTT  HERE'S THE STUPID  PART  WHEN I GO TO THE SEARCH üîç I TYPE A APP THEY OVER HERE  WANTING  ME TO PAY („ÄçÔæüÔæõÔæü)ÔΩ£·¥∫·¥º·¥º·¥º·¥º·¥º~ I'M NOT PAYING FOR  YOUTUBE  SO I USEED a sneaky  trick I go to the remote and go to that  roku search  on TV and it says add and ima)(click) BOOOMBAYAAHHH HALLELUJAH üôåüôåüôåüôåüôå PRAISE GOD  I'VE BEEN SUFFERING FROM  THIS PAYING FOR  MONEY and here's the best  part bro THEY HAVE GAMES ROKU I'M HUNTING U AND I'M STEALING  YA GAMES I HAVE LIKE 80 APPS ON THERE HAAAHHAHA SO YA BYE (sorry üíúüÖêüÖ°üÖúüÖ®‚Å∑‚ü¨‚ü≠üíú army  me apologize) | I think the reason why I rated this a two star is because it is so slow and when I pressed buttons it didn‚Äôt work so I rated it a two star | Our remote stopped working‚Ä¶the Roku app has been a lifesaver! | This is a very good app. If you lost your remote or something, I recommend this app you can do several different TVs tablets and more this game is very fun.

She was driving home from work around 22:00 in drizzling rain, navigating a sharp curve when she lost control of her car and drove full speed into a creek. The only way we found her location was through the Life360 app! The creek was about 10 feet below the roadway, so when units were looking for her, they kept driving past her because her car wasn‚Äôt visible from the road. My husband finally directed someone to her exact location and they were able to retrieve my daughter from the creek! I will forever be grateful for this app! | It‚Äôs very useful. It works in different countries not just the US. I totally recommend it. | My mom hasn‚Äôt been at the school in like 5 hours and It says she still is.

Yes you can track your kids everyday but this isn‚Äôt the best app. See I have extremely strict parents and they only use life 360 to check our phone percentage and see where we at and they check our phone percentage all day everyday even while we were sitting with them. They don‚Äôt allow us to charge our phones and get back on them and they always know if we‚Äôve charged I hate this app. I wish they never made it. Take off this feature with the battery percentage and it‚Äôll be perfect. | Works well assist with peace of mind to know where my family is at. Wife broke down I was able to go directly to her location and assist AAA find our location. | This is the best app there is.  This app gives moms  peace of mind. | Pricey for not being accurate and has lag. I enjoyed it initially but doesn‚Äôt give real time accuracy. | Meh, this thing works sometimes. 
Not always. 
It shows him still driving when I know he has arrived home. Last night, he arrived home and 30 minutes later the app notified me that he arrived. 
The routes driven are not accurate. The map shows him driving on roads near a freeway when I know he is on the freeway and there are no roads where it says he is. 
Glad I haven‚Äôt paid for this thing. 
And yes all the settings for his phone are correct and on- I checked. 
Just don‚Äôt count on this thing. | This app is a life saver, it helps ease this mamas mind with a new teen driver! | It's cool to offer trials and even cooler when the service provides features like those of this thieving company. It's not cool when you choose to discontinue use of the service and diligently cancel a trial, within said company's own deadline, and they charge your card days later anyway. In fact, it's theft. I've already disputed the theft with my card service and been refunded but it doesn't change anything about the company. In fact, they're not only thieves but they also created unnecessary  hassle that held up MY money for days and overshadowed the service they offer. 0/10 would not recommend to anyone I care about, nor will I be using them again. Disgraceful. | The app doesn‚Äôt tell u the right times my circle leaves and tells me things like they just left home and there not because there with me at grandmas so I uninstalled the app and tried to download it again I hope it got an update I really want this app to work.! | I caught my girlfriend cheating with this app, I don‚Äôt think I can live anymore.. GREAT APP | I truly believe having Life360 Lessened my anxiety everytime the kids left the house ! I truly don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôd do without the Life360 APP

When we‚Äôve lost our phones, either in the woods, along a highway, or around the buildings, the app took us right to it. It‚Äôs a 5 star app! | RECOMMEND | Hey guys it‚Äôd be real great if you could make it where I could change my notification sounds. No I don‚Äôt want them off. I know they can be silenced. A lot of my places are. I do want to be noticed when they arrive at certain places. I‚Äôd just like to have the 1 for home sound different than everywhere else.  My kids arrive at school?‚Ä¶.Dogs loose their minds and try to kill each other to get out the dog door. Husband arrived at work? (Works night shift) My dogs power bomb off the foot of my bed.  Barking wakes the entire house to run out the dog door to greet‚Ä¶.. no one!! My daughter makes it safely to her Dorm after work?‚Ä¶. Dogs leap over each other racing out the door to barking at‚Ä¶. nothing. So yeah be real great if I could pick notification sounds for different places. Other than that decent app. | Best app | It‚Äôs too easy! I‚Äôm not used to such a wonderfull application internet tool!! Much appreciated!!! Sincerely a forever adherent!!!

My sisters birthday will be a success thanks to Gregory! | Took forever to get a ride confirmed; kept rejecting pay. | Great job my guy | My phones about to die and you have been not connecting me to a driver for the last hour and a half so I guees I‚Äôm stranded here now. Terrible app | Great driver | Ed is an amazing individual and made my very first Uber experience an excellent one!

Thank you so much Ed.

I‚Äôm looking forward to reading your books. | I waited on a padre for 15 minutes he got 4 minutes from me the time went to 2 minutes then back to 4 minutes and after waiting another 5 minutes he dropped my pickup. | Great service! | This was my first Uber trip ever and Barry made it very enjoyable. Very personable and very sweet.. I‚Äôd give him 20 starts if I could. | Clean car. Helpful and excellent driver!!! | Excellent service | Poor ride choices, automatic cancellation fees, Uber seems to disregard people‚Äôs time. | Simply the best thank you so much | He was very helpful and courteous! | I would like to sincerely thank you for the service | This was hands down the best Uber driver you will ever encounter. | Our first time using Uber‚Ä¶ so I downloaded the app - it was very confusing - It looked like we had it scheduled, and they sent us a drivers name.
when we went in the night before it said ‚Äúfailed‚Äù.
I was a nervous wreck. So I signed up again - but it took me over an hour‚Ä¶..next time I think well just rent a car - less frustration. | Terrific driver and very knowledgable about the city. Great Uber experience | Anthony was by far the best driver for Uber we have had. He was so welcoming and held great conversation with us the entire time. It was if we had known him forever. This guy deserves a bonus. Great job! | Thanks‚Ä¶ | Taylor was awesome, car was pretty and comfy, got me home safe and sound :) | Was wonderful and lovely. | Very kind and friendly. Thanks Jared | It‚Äôs simple and easy to use. Makes practical sense | the last 2 drives i had cars smelled terrible. the one that took me to Publix her car smelled like animal piss. and the guy that just brung me back had a stell smell. | Great job Edward!! | Was a great driver my mom is elderly and he was very helpful with assisting her in and out of the vehicle. Very kind! | Professional y muy atento | Was a bit nervous never having taken an Uber. The process was easy and the driver was wonderful. On time clean vehicle  he also made sure I got into my home safely. Thank you! | Ella es incre√≠ble,muy buena gente y responsable al manejar,la recomiendo al 100% | I keep turining offf the notifications because they use push notifications for marketing. Then the notifications are off for my ride! | We have been using Uber since we arrived in Fort Lauderdale two months ago.  The drivers are pleasant and they always arrive within the stated time frame.  Five stars in these categories.

However, the final price we are charged is CONSISTENTLY higher than what we were given initially when we booked the ride.  Sometimes it‚Äôs less than a dollar,  sometimes more.   I emailed Uber Support, and they said I should send them a picture of the original quoted fare.  How do you do that when it disappears upon booking the ride?  And who has time for this anyway?   While the individual extra charges are small, they add up.   Uber has a nice little thing going here.

We have switched to Curb, and the price you see originally is EXACTLY  what you are charged.   I‚Äôll only use Uber again when I am desperate and no other service is available. | Terrible gps for drivers as well as booking rides and the drivers make personal stops ;which delay you further from getting to where you need to go. | Excellent!  Very cordial extremely timely very very pleasant !  Kudos Anthony:) | I travel on a somewhat regular basis and by airplane. When in different cities and don‚Äôt rent cars Uber is the best way to get from one place to another.  I tried a different service once and was left hanging because they didn‚Äôt have a driver.  I got on the Uber App and got an immediate response and made it to the airport on time!  Uber is reliable and provides excellent services!! | I had a very bad experience on the 21st of March which made me say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never use Uber again‚Äù. 

I reserved a ride and the driver went into the wrong apartment complex. Through text I was trying to give her instructions and because she didn‚Äôt speak English she cancelled my ride. 
I made another reservation. This guy didn‚Äôt speak English and had Spanish on his navigation system. What was different with this ride is he showed up and got me where I needed to go. He could do that but not speak to me. 

My complaint is how can non-English speaking people work where they need to communicate with customers? What if there was something wrong with the car forcing the driver to pull to the side of the road? How could they tell me what the problem was? This is only one example of many more cases where this is a problem. From my experience they don‚Äôt even want to understand English, no interest in it. I remember my grandmother, who came as a child from Finland, telling me her and her parents worked very hard to learn English and they did. Not knowing English was an embarrassment to them. It was a priority. 

In many jobs we are supposed to speak  Spanish or you lose out on job opportunities. This is so backwards. I‚Äôm not going to learn Spanish at 64 years old so Spanish speaking people in jobs they shouldn‚Äôt be in can carry on a conversation with me. Not going to happen. | Best driver out there in NYC respectfully, knowledgeable and go above and beyond, please use him for your rides. | Over charge | thank you | There have been several instances where I was assigned a driver and either the driver cancel or UBER canceled a minute before arrival. Then I was reassigned another driver which ultimately made me late for work and I was charged a fee. On the 21st of March I was assigned a driver for $10 dollars then all of a sudden kicked out of the UBER app and had to sign back in only this app did not have my profile picture. I ordered another UBER & rec‚Äôd a price of $24 but I had to get to work. When I came out to meet the driver the previous driver was sitting out there. She finally called me & I explained there was some hiccup with the App but I was charged a cancellation fee of $6.05. I ended up buying a brand new car. UBER customer service & ride share service is TRASH anymore. I am trying to submit & it‚Äôs asking me for a nickname only it‚Äôs not taking any of my names. Go figure. You may or may not see this post. | The best ride yet very smooth | Driver was on time & courteous. | The driver was very respectful and friendly. Also her car was really clean. Thanks ! | Tyler was so so amazing ! He was great conversation and this was truly an enjoyable ride. Hope to get him again! | I wish every driver was as nice as the one I had last night. Such a delight. | Go Honda!! | great driver | Help me find my mental health doctors for anxiety | Kelvin was absolutely awesome driver - this was our first Uber ride.

Whenever I go to delete a pin it crashes and I have to restart the app. There‚Äôs no way to contact the app developers about this either. I may have to look into not using this platform anymore unfortunately because this is a serious issue. | It was a really great app in the beginning. Now it‚Äôs basically just adds. Once upon a time it offered suggestions based on your interests. Now it just gives adds. They completely sold out and it shows. Such a shame. It really used to be great. | Now on my feed, my hidden pins from my secret boards are showing up. I hide pins that are for example Christmas, until Christmas time so I can keep track of the seasons and times of year on my feed. I don‚Äôt care that others can‚Äôt see them. I don‚Äôt want to see my hidden pins from secret boards on my feed. Sometimes pins have no links so I save them on ‚Äúrandom(my secret catch all board)‚Äù until I can find the source. Instagram and Pinterest do not configure sometimes so I save to my secret board till I can find the link. I save pins to multiple boards which then has two of the same pins on my feed. Also the new favorites button doesn‚Äôt work. Please return my feed to save pins, no secret pins. | Just Yes | So great I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§ë | Every time I try to scroll through the pins on my boards the app closes the board. It is impossible to scroll completely through the board. | Pinterest has literally a life saver from inspiration to heart warming pictures and to crafting! Pinterest is a ligitmate app <3 | there are more ads on my feed than there is content to pin. it's really ridiculous and makes the app awful to use. | Pottery videos flooding my feed for days‚Ä¶.you are ridiculous | This is my fav app, the only thing I want back is the watch button, I miss it :( | there are far too many ads. like, each time i‚Äôm on the home page i will have minimum of one ad on my home screen. also, whatever the algorithm has been programmed to display is not doing it‚Äôs job - i see the same exact posts daily. like, within 15 minutes of scrolling. it‚Äôs definitely a good way to limit my screen time because it gets so frustrating i quickly close the app. | My algorith broke out of nowhere. Things that i never looked for are popping up! Deleting the app!! | It's so irritating to be on this app now. So many ads that it's miserable to scroll. It seems like every third thing is an add! I used to spend a lot of time on this app and now I'm debating on deleting it altogether | I CANT SIGN INN!!!!!!!!! | Pinterest is an AMAZING app but recently I haven‚Äôt been able to see my created pins. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PINTEREST!! | I enjoy looking for some new items! | I love the pictures and videos, keep up the work. It would be nice if there was a video section, where the icons are. | This is one of the best apps I have been on it‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and you can find all types of thing videos, wallpapers, and you can even save stuff so it won‚Äôt get lost. | this app is so helpful for pics, videos, gifs, inspo, etc. its like a diary! i luv my whisper girlies üíû | Please fix this. Ive created around 20 pins but only 4 are showing up. My friend says she still sees them on my account but I can‚Äôt | So when I tried logging in it says I‚Äôm not eligible to join the app. So can you guys fix this please? | I used to spend hours on Pinterest, 10 years ago. It was so much fun. Now whenever I click on an image it‚Äôll take me to Wattpad, a 404 message, or an article written by a bot. It‚Äôs gotten so spammy and full of ads. And they STILL haven‚Äôt fixed the issue with the home page refreshing after leaving the app then coming back later. I‚Äôm really frustrated and disappointed with how much worse Pinterest has gotten.

3/24- Update: It seems like there‚Äôs more ad videos now. The issue with refreshing has gotten a little better, I still don‚Äôt understand why the app developers thought refreshing constantly would be a good idea. 
Now I never see stuff from the people I follow, on my home page, anymore. It‚Äôs just all suggested stuff and ads.

When I open a pin it closes the entire app and when I open it again it removes the home, search, and pin buttons. This has been going on for over a year with no fix, on 3 different phones too. Please update. | I love this app there is so many cute things like decor ideas, ideas for quiencenera‚Äôs,funny videos,cute videos and lots of memes and cute Fanart.

I can no longer reply to others, I‚Äôll be halfway through writing a comment and it will take away the type box and delete everything, I‚Äôll even finish and press post and it doesn‚Äôt send the comment. If it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it, it‚Äôs been completely ruined with this update. | ok. usually when apps companies update their app it gets better. NOT PINTEREST APPARENTLY!!!! i cant message people through the app anymore, nor can i see my followers. and some of my friends and family that i follow it wont show. not even when i search for their profile. there are also many different dumb unnecessary updates, like when i post something it wont allow me to turn on comment. i‚Äôve asked others if these things are the same for them- and surprise surprise it is. and on top of all of this it randomly turned my business account to a normal account messing up a lot of stuff i‚Äôve been working on for months. i‚Äôm 16 years old and the terms of service says that if you‚Äôre 16 years old or older you should have control over this stuff. also they do random updates where it completely messes up my For You to just random stuff like makeup, jordans, and nail stuff, which i have never saved or marked as my interests. which there is nothing wrong with people who like that, i just personally don‚Äôt like that stuff. so why is it being recommended as the default even though i never saved anything like that? and if mark as ‚Äúirrelevant to me‚Äù it still shows it. so i doubt customer service will see this, but please fix these problems. and fix them the right way. i really do love pinterest but every time they do something weird to it i start using it less and less. | I used to love going on Pinterest for inspiration, but now there‚Äôs an ad almost every other post (not even including promoted content).

for a fresh brewed Coffee filled Yeti, 
sit in my ride, engage in mind drifting, listen to Smooth Jazz & vist Pinterest

the pictures that I select 

I certainly appreciate the variety of pictures available to choose from and again, 
I engage in that action every single day

                                          A. K. A. Yanni | Every single pin I open lately is an ad!!!! | It only shows you what it has decided you will see.

Your entire feed will become these few things you hate!

It will vehemently pile those upon you without any working customization for yourself. Even after saying you do NOT want to see it EVERY TIME IT POPS UP, pinterest will continue to shove it down your throat and only show you those.

 I have boards that pinterest out right refuses to show more similar or related content about that is not against the guidelines and has a plethora of unseen content that I've searched for, tapped on, liked, and saved! The worthless algorithm is stuck and cant update based on its own customization that it consistently and annoyingly thrusts upon the users | When I try to zoom in on a picture it freezes up my phone.  Why can‚Äôt this issue be fixed? | I love this app but there are way too many ads. | i‚Äôve noticed pinterest has started deleting my replies to comments on my pins. super frustrating as i will reply to someone, answer a question, etc. but then it disappears and looks like im ignoring them. pls fix this | Me and best friend love this app so much it is the best app ever created me and her send memes to each other every day like the preppy Peppa Pig meme and I love everything about it | Pinterest is the best no adds and lots of things to look at | Wayyy too many ads. And now I can‚Äôt flag something that is suggested to me as not interested | I love going down the Pinterest rabbit hole just as much as the next person who is trying to escape reality. However, there are a few things that need to be addressed‚Ä¶

1. Too many ads
2. Too buggy

Thanks for listening. | The new policies and using ai to monitor the platform is causing so many people to either lose their accounts from faulty reports or consider leaving Pinterest entirely. The new CEO wants it to be a shopping site which isn‚Äôt even the reason why Pinterest grew so popular in the first place, and now there‚Äôs an insane amount of scammy ads which just makes it difficult to use. You don‚Äôt have to be experienced in marketing to understand that frustrating and ignoring the needs of your audience is actually gonna cause you to lose money as a company, because people will just end up deactivating their accounts if they haven‚Äôt been auto-banned already. Just from taking a few minutes to read through the r/pinterest subreddit I found so many people who are struggling with the exact same things I am. And I mean HUNDREDS of people talking about how completely normal, safe, appropriate pins they‚Äôve saved have been removed because, guess what, ai can‚Äôt correctly or accurately tell the difference between normal/sfw and explicit/harmful content. Not that the CEO cares though since he‚Äôs been deleting people‚Äôs comments with complaints on Twitter. If things don‚Äôt change for the better, chances are Pinterest will lose a lot of users and therefore lose revenue from getting too greedy, which I‚Äôd hate to see because I used to love the platform. Stop relying on tech bros and ai systems and start actually caring about the people who support you as a company. | I put my birth year and it said I'm not eligible to sign up LIKE IM OVER 12 | UGHHH with the update! I prefer to have the option of hiding my secret board pins from my main feed or at least have the ability to see my main feed how other‚Äôs would. I prefer being able to quickly go to a feed to see what I (or who I follow) recently pinned as well. PLEASE FIX THIS! | I do NOT fw this update, it looks so much better when you can see the text bigger on the amount of pins you have, i am BEGGING you to change the layout slightly back PLEASE | I can‚Äôt get into the app I‚Äôm doing my right age and stuff and gmail and it‚Äôs not letting me in I and it keeps saying that  something is going wrong on there end.

I used to have an iPhone 12 mini, it was getting kinda old and two other app I use also had some issues. So, I upgraded to an iPhone 15 pro. Now it went from Discord crashing/freezing nearly every time I use the app to only about 3 times a day.

I have seen Reddit pages where people say that happened but no solution PLEASE FIX THIS! it has happened twice now | Look I got into discord FINALLY and I went into some servers but after like a hour it just says to verify myself. Like why do I have to verify myself. I put in my email and password and it said I‚Äôll get mail. BUT I DIDNT GET ANY MAIL. I kept in resending BUT I DIDNT GET ANT MAIL. Just because of that it gets 4 stars. It‚Äôs still a good app it‚Äôs just so annoying that it keeps popping up in my screen. The community is nice and all and I was having a good time but then the verification screen popped up and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. | This is is pretty okay, even though is has had some downsides, like now. There is one problem in particular that I have, which is streaming. My Xbox sometimes will not load or start streaming to discord vc, and I have tried multiple ways to fix the issue, such as: Restarting both app and console, disconnecting and reconnecting the xbox connection to discord, checking the ‚Äúonline & privacy‚Äù setting, etc. None have worked so far, please look into this. Also, I would like to have an option for PS4 to have the streaming service too, unfair for only the PS5 to have vc option. | I‚Äòve have this app since 2021, it is absolutely amazing whether you have Nitro or not! Amazing for texting and having fun friend group calls. | BLUD IT NEEDS TO STEP UP ITS GAME | After the recent update my mobile notifications won‚Äôt work no matter what I do, I‚Äôve reset them and prioritized the channels I need notifications from and it still won‚Äôt work | New mobile layout ruins the app with no way to revert | Just leave the UI alone. It was never one of your problems, until you decided to change it. Stop it. Leave things where they go. I can‚Äôt find anything anymore and gestures do random things whenever attempted. For the love of god. Stop.

‚ÄúGo read about the new stuff!‚Äù No. I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve used discord since beta, I shouldn‚Äôt HAVE TO. | Should have an option to disable it and go back to the old UI | I‚Äôve enjoyed the app for a while, it‚Äôs good for communication between large groups- however, with every coming update I keep hoping and keep getting disappointed. The mobile app is so extremely buggy these days that I‚Äôve been tempted to delete it and instead use the browser version of discord on my phone which is obviously quite hard to work with on it‚Äôs own because it wasn‚Äôt made for phones. Well in the one that‚Äôs made for phones it‚Äôs hard to find the pins of threads at all. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating that one cannot search threads but instead has to search the channel. As well, any channels that share names might have their pins swapped so then you have to go into the channel settings and look at the pins through there. Finally, and the biggest cause for my frustration, is even when my phone‚Äôs rotation is locked, if I try to search a channel or look at it‚Äôs settings/members then the screen will rotate some random way. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm holding my phone straight, sideways, upside down, it will rotate, it is especially annoying when trying to find something quickly. | Go back to old layout please | Ive been a discord user since 2020 theres been tons of changes but this one this recent one is horrible and confusing. I used discord because i understand it and it isnt confusing. Congrats discord. I hate your app | Please update app there are bugs. Thank you. | WHY DID IT CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE!? | Every time I except a invite I keep getting send to the App Store despite me already having the discord because of this I haven‚Äôt been able to join a discord server for about two years now | So I got falsely reported by someone I knew 3 yrs ago for being a scammer, and they mass reported me. But they came to their senses and realized that I was NOT the one who did it, so they contacted discord and told them to not delete my acc. But discord went ahead and made me prove myself.
How ya might ask??? By buying at least $800 in gift cards. Not for myself, but for them. They promised me it was refundable. But the next day ( today), they claimed that the refund was error, and I had to pay another $500 fee to get the money back. Now they won‚Äôt even respond to me anymore. ATP im thinking I got scammed by discord themselves, and they‚Äôre not gonna refund my money, but gonna make me completely drain my bank account for them. 
And to add, I only have $500 so after I pay another $500, I got an even $0, no money to pay for gas to even go to work. I‚Äôm broke now, and can‚Äôt even get to work because of these ppl. ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ | There been some lags with emojis from different apps,
My favorite emoji app was from fan made video game.
But every time I use it discord kicks me out please fix it. | Yea discord is AMAZING but I am going to keep this short just use IMessages | This new user interface for the emoji keyboard is not showing every single server emoji, even when i go to the server tab. I can‚Äôt access some of the emojis I pay MONEY to use. Please fix this as soon as possible, all emojis should show, not just 33 out of the 50 I have made. | I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs happened but discord does not seem optimized to run on ipad ios. Works fine on iphone, android and PC though‚Ä¶ | I don‚Äôt give a $h!t about some stupid poll option, move the camera option back out of the photos so I can send them easier. | It‚Äôs an amazing app however my screen sharing doesn‚Äôt work anymore and I can‚Äôt seem to fix it at all | I‚Äôve used discord for a few years and it always worked fine for me. I really enjoy it. Ever since the new UI update changed things around, my app on my phone has been incredibly buggy. It‚Äôs slower when switching between servers and messages. Whenever I‚Äôm in a call with someone, sometimes I can‚Äôt send messages. The entire keyboard disappears. Whenever an alarm goes off or I mute myself and then unmute myself, my discord audio just stops working. I am having to constantly close the app and restart it to get it to work now. I am not the only one having these issues, I‚Äôve spoken to other people that also have these issues. Both on android and iphone. I‚Äôve been waiting on them to fix these issues but it hasn‚Äôt happened yet so I figured I would write a review to let you know these things are happening. I love this app, please bring it back to being useable.

Edit: I keep my app regularly updated. It‚Äôs your fault discord, not mine. | Been a member of discord for 4 years haven‚Äôt had any issues but recently when me and my girlfriend get into a call, we cannot hear each other whatsoever. We‚Äôve tried multiple things to fix it and found no success. If this problem wasn‚Äôt affecting us I would give discord 5 stars, I haven‚Äôt had an issues with it until now. | Discord is a great application to talk to your friends and make friends in different servers and the nitro features are also really good but today i bought the nitro subscription again but i didn‚Äôt got it if a discord administrator reading this please give me a refund or the nitro | I use discord on iPad and it has been unusably buggy with no signs of improvement, only getting worse, for over a MONTH. Every new update only adds more bugs and doesn‚Äôt fix any old ones. I am unable to properly select channels, the whole application randomly goes dark when I click on a different server, and (extremely disappointing as a nitro user) I am unable to select all the emojis from a server‚ÄîI only have a limited list that seems to be selected at random. I am sick of discord‚Äôs terrible customer service and worsening quality. | this app is horrible , like banning someone for not having no money is crazy . | I often get lost in bigger servers, (especially roleplay servers) because the highlight thing stays stuck on the first channel I click, and when I click on other channels it doesn‚Äôt appear. | Buggy it‚Äôs glitches out servers making it look like nothing is there fix the problem please. | I‚Äôm trying to sign up but when it sends me my verification code it says a user already has the code | iOS 17.4, iPhone 15 Pro, can‚Äôt hear voice room‚Äôs sound, I tried rebooting my phone, checking if I accidentally open deafen mode, checking if Discord has enough permission form iPhone, checking if it‚Äôs my Bluetooth headphone‚Äôs problem, but nothing worked, so maybe it‚Äôs a incompatible problem? | They make a lot of unnecessary updates that can sometimes break the app.

Recently, about three updates ago and that hasn‚Äôt been changed: Gifs and videos posted in app no longer move or play while in a Discord call. This seems to only be an issue on the Mobile app, or on the Mobile iOS app. This can be extremely frustrating as I‚Äôm often in a call with my friends when they send certain gifs or videos that they‚Äôd like me to react to!

On top of that, they removed a feature where you could use emojis from a server you aren‚Äôt apart of if you have Nitro. This was a nice, quality feature for everyone. I‚Äôve only seen disscontempt for the change and I share it as well, I add and make my own emojis and stickers for for my group chat. If anyone they send those emojis and stickers too sees that and likes them. I‚Äôm completely okay with them using those emojis and stickers! I‚Äôd rather that person enjoy my creations rather than have a silent random in my group chat that doesn‚Äôt wanna be there but is forced to just to be able to use my emojis/stickers!

Also. After the big update recently. Forcing a huge square to be present on the screen in mobile version while in the call, even if screenshare isn‚Äôt on; is extremely ugly and gets in the way a lot. I constantly have to move it around, accidentally press it when I‚Äôm trying to do something else, and find myself always repositioning it in odd positions when I want to take a screenshot :(

Besides these three issues, Discord seems to be on the up! Calls rarely ever drop anymore like they used to and I don‚Äôt find myself having many issues with it!

I truly love Discord. I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh. But these three things are important! And I want nothing but to see discord thrive! | I am a YouTuber and I use discord to talk to my friends, but no screen recorder can record a call while I am playing a game, when I talk to them about this issue, they say that it‚Äôs because discord doesn‚Äôt allow outside things from recording calls to be replayed, is this possible for you people to fix?

I don‚Äôt think so -
What Twitter want to be heard that gets pushed. 
All those ‚ÄúElon thank you you awesome *_* ‚Äú 
Comments - cmon!!! | This app has been circling the drain ever since Elon bought it, I wish there was an alternative | Not satisfied the employees at the company are trying to make the world like Elon musk and that‚Äôs not right. That‚Äôs invading his privacy and puts him and his family at risk and that‚Äôs not caring about the business or the owner who‚Äôs paying your wage for you to live (meant for X app employees.) | Great to use and app/news source that is not completely one sided!  Thanks! | We reporterd scammers online on X pretending to be advertisers and nothing was done and no follow up email. We lost $600 and we warned people and wrote to x but no response. Don‚Äôt trust anything you see on X. | Twitter used to be news and a way to reach government representatives. Now it‚Äôs extreme white supremacy and unrelenting hate speech. And Elliot Musk turned a normal app into a concentrated cesspool of distilled bigotry and extremist propaganda. Only psychopaths use Twitter now. | Nobody does hate better. | Too many ads, confusing UI. Just all around a total mess of an app. Is this seriously what is popular? | It‚Äôs beyond racist, and you only seem to police one side. A lot like the state of our country. | It would seem you can post porn, murders, trans people grooming children and all other things on here. I got banned however for saying someone got what they deserved. Strange how ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù is only ok when it involves trans people wanting your kids or libs wanting to abort them. | Continue improving! | I can‚Äôt figure out where else to report a bug - when I‚Äôm scrolling the timeline and scroll past a muted video, why does X pause music I‚Äôm playing? It used to be that music would only pause if I click on the video | I loved Twitter, until I didn‚Äôt. So happy to see more balanced news and opinions on X. | No one sided platform | Twitter was once a great place for a lot of different things and interests in social media but something has caused an rapid increase in scammy ads, sex bots, and fake peofiles. | FB is trash compare to this. | This app definitely help to keep tabs on love ones and family members but the work of such tracking apps is usually limited because you always need to access the device you want to keep tabs on in order for the tracking app to work effectively. My question is if i can access the device i want to hack, why would I need it hacked? But i understand we hack devices due to different intentions and to recover some information that must have been deleted or kept from being easily seen, the device will be required to be cloned. Being unfaithful gives rise to a whole lot of issues and situations that might be very difficult to cope with if you don't have an account of what is really going down with your partner when you are not together. If you keep getting these signs it's most likely to be true your partner is cheating. That's not the end of life anyway, you can make a choice that suits you and be to your advantage for something like that to never repeat itself. For anvone that find themselves in this situation, what you need is to contact a private ethical investigator named Kevin at (spyhackcyber @ Gmail com )to find out what has been going on behind your back, and fix it as quick as you can. His services are highly rated and affordable, regardless whether your problem is personal or beyond personal, I am certain that whatever you are passing through will be fixed in a jiffy. I am a huge testimony to his exploits and I highly endorse that you write to him. | until pop ups end your algo is BROKEN how about showing ALL who I follow so I don't have to bookmark them to see with all the tweets WHY the same stupid tweets in the for you tab refresh tweets is pitifully slow same old same old over and over again | I hope that Threads eventually takes over your market share. | App itself works fine‚Ä¶but the actual product is now constantly inundated with irrelevant, often inflammatory content, porn/OnlyFans bots, and crypto currency spam | Twitter is way worse since Musk took over in general, but the Israeli propaganda flooding my feed in support of genocide is unbelievable | X is the best social media platform for freedom of ideas and freedom to express your opinions without censorship! Thank you! | X is the best source of reliable information in the world. | Too many follow requests and messages from scammer. | I use X and enjoy all the new improvements they keep adding to the app.  Thanks | Musk has taken Twitter and turned it into a right wing hate media. It‚Äôs almost Truth Social now. | Hey is X appropriate to use? Like I wouldn't use this if there is inappropriate picture/other bad stuffs. | Pome coin is the future | Amazing app | I never leave Twitter on anything but ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù status, meaning I only want to view posts from people I follow.  Almost every time I go back to Twitter, I‚Äôm forced into viewing the ‚Äúfor you‚Äù feed, which inevitably is saturated with posts from Musk, sharing his political views.  Almost like a propaganda machine now.  All I want is the weather and a few other topics.  He has other plans for what I see it seems. | What Can I Say. I Just Love It! Thanks To Mr. Elon Musk, That Totally Changed The Experience Of The Social Platform. | If you love free speech then X is for you | We are in a peak on our history when I feel scared and concern of our safety. They are blocking and banning free speech. And where else should we post without being threatened by 5i0ni5tS? So let me tell you something. F R33 P4135Tin3. We will have a war beacuse of them. I don‚Äôt have we here to complaint but in the reviews I feel pitty but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on people. Be safe out there | The ‚Äúfollow‚Äù button next to ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ in timeline is so weird and cause me a lot of following the account i was about to block! | X is like Fetch, it‚Äôs never gonna happen! | This app is suddenly becoming a cesspool of bots and rage bait propaganda | Unlike other social media platforms, this one allows you to speak and think freely. 
Meta and Tiktok have banned me for telling the truth, X rewards me. 
You chose. | Suspended my account for no reason. üëÄ | x | Now it is full of racism, antisemitism, porn and only fans models.

The comments used to be fun to read, now none of them are related to the original post.

I miss Jack‚Äôs version of Twitter. Elon is such an embarrassment. | Muskrat couldn‚Äôt even spell his own name let alone run a company. Trash app | I purchased the subscription and the money was withdrawn, but I did not get my subscription, please activate the subscription | Left twitter because I was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù banned several times by the censors. Always reinstated but felt not welcome. Looking forward to a much better experience with twitter under new management

Update: Now  X.com/twitter is much more of a free expression of ideas and where opposing sides can both talk and be offended. | Elon, musk understands and is honest  in  his opinions. | Double down on freedom. Thanks Elon | He really did | A poor community lost value when Elon bought Twitter.   But he bought a voice. | The amount of hate and extremism tolerated on this app now is disgusting. Elon ruined it. | The x platform is simple user friendly platform- I enjoy its uncensored content.
Great job by Elon Musk and the X team ! Please keep up the great work, free uncensored speech for ever! | Theres too many spam/bait posts on the platform and the comments are almost always filled with unrelated replies from bot accounts",4.59339,8402121,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1d/ab/96/1dab9693-b40f-c960-ff1b-5a039b24feff/4288ab83-9c29-4f3a-a60f-c0124f29b7a0_iPhone_5.5_-_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/07/b4/0e/07b40ea6-e932-89a5-3a9b-db5f8077ce73/29e32f40-9fa3-4d2c-bf29-b8c578631347_iPhone_5.5_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/70/27/86/7027863f-79b1-eb15-0205-cfa2d2e40101/fd07b9c5-a7de-4699-8d54-39c304518f07_iPhone_5.5_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c1/6c/05/c16c05a8-4a33-2f0a-2018-226cb4e6dd7c/99b3eccf-de06-45d6-9bf4-daf06d7b0f9f_iPhone_5.5_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6e/8b/90/6e8b90f1-1698-80db-fbd5-c9ccfd29d86a/96d3289a-a87c-4bca-aaa9-442d03d6aa5e_iPhone_5.5_-_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/af/aa/33/afaa3308-b87b-187c-3a67-7c07e47c3d14/770e6822-f28e-4e4b-be51-8bfbe36f4307_iPad_12.9_-_1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/33/14/3c/33143c40-318f-d231-6b51-f6d03290f30a/7e053a3e-190b-4585-9927-509871425aad_iPad_12.9_-_2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/70/74/e3/7074e375-e46d-7ba8-cc19-742ed9c77999/af4a69eb-36c5-463c-9677-c2a72dfaa7dc_iPad_12.9_-_3.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Thats stupid | Last message I sent earlier today shows that it was seen March 8th. This is not right. Why is it showing the wrong date? | Some of my friend can‚Äôt send me massage cause showing ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt send massage this account‚Äù | My previous account was hacked and I haven‚Äôt been able to get it back; it‚Äôs still active. It would be nice to have more options to retrieve your account if hacked.

Also, recently, friends haven‚Äôt been able to message me but I never blocked or restricted them. | True and sad | You cowards censored my photos. You‚Äôre cracking down before the election as usual. I really hope that somebody actually gets in your way to stop you.  It was really weird to see the thing that come up and said you sure you want to do this and now I can‚Äôt even add photos because you decided to disable it on me. Jerks. | The new update broke the account switching and now it won‚Äôt let me switch to my personal account | How much user information has Facebook, Apple, & Microsoft sold or given away for free? Predators. All these companies forcing more pins, longer more complicated passwords, and they all send me sms text messages to confirm my identity. What do you want from the users of this app?  All these extra security measures for what purpose? You‚Äôve already sold or freely given away everyone‚Äôs phone numbers, emails, passwords, addresses, etc. What is going on here? | I‚Äôve used messanger for years. After the Outage last week, I have been completely unable to access my account. Says to retry the app, but I have done so hundreds of times. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled even more times. Years of contacts gone. Thanks. | Stop trying to force us to create a chat history pin. | What happened to messenger? When you share something from FBMP, it doesn‚Äôt show the link, it shows tons of codes. | Why I can‚Äôt skip using PIN to access my Facebook Messenger App. It supposed to be optional‚Ä¶ I think I am done with FB Messenger at least for now. Let‚Äôs see what happens! | Your community standards is annoying | My notifications have stopped working!! Everything in my settings is turned on but all of the sudden I am not receiving any messenger notifications. I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app. My cousin went through the same thing for months! | I was just forced to download the latest update and now I no longer receive message notifications.  Notifications are turned on, I've toggled on/off and restarted iPhone. Nothing! Please fix!! üëéüèª | If I could give zero stars I would. Since I can‚Äôt the one star will suffice. Messenger forcing me to create a PIN code is Moronic. We as users should have the option to not have to create one. | I don‚Äôt like suggest channel nothing interesting to watch remove it please or stop showing it because it‚Äôs so annoying | Literally catering to cheaters and liars. | For the last week and a half or so, despite checking my settings that allow for all incoming messages from people I‚Äôm not friends with to go to my Message Requests , all incoming message senders see is that I‚Äôm ‚Äú Not Receiving Messages‚Äù   I have sent multiple support requests and I‚Äôve heard nothing. I am being removed from groups. I‚Äôve joined because one of the rules is not blocking Admin and they are saying I am blocking them. I can‚Äôt even communicate with some people now. I have no idea friends or other people have tried to message me and I just don‚Äôt know it, it‚Äôs ridiculous and I‚Äôd really like some help | Can not use on my iPhone anymore üò° | I‚Äôve cleared every section in Messenger to no avail. What gives???? | This feature is blocking out 90% of my chat contacts window on iPhone. 

Also, I don‚Äôt want random people showing up in messaging app. 

Searching online says there‚Äôs a way to do it previously, but that option is missing in the 2024 version of the app.

Any help would be appreciated! | Hey how come you guys will not let us use our persona pictures for background photos? | it‚Äôs RIDICULOUS that this isn‚Äôt already an option

fb has *at least* 18 categories of notifications with customizable push/email/txt ..but if someone in one of your groups PMs you, the only way to find out is to keep checking your special box like you‚Äôre waiting on mail through USPS | Please fix the problem i can't add notes on my messanger too | It‚Äôs buffed asl but I updated it and then is said bug fix needed and I haven‚Äôt been able to access my account ever since | Today I was on my phone just texting friends next to you know I apparently I guess I send a thumbs up to somebody that I don‚Äôt even know and don‚Äôt even have added as a friend and then it‚Äôs requesting money and it keeps happening. It‚Äôs like someone hacked into my account when the whole Facebook and messenger went down a while ago and I have changed my password and I‚Äôm still getting this problem so if someone can fix it, I would appreciate it because I don‚Äôt wanna have to make a new one because this is technically your app. Your fault I do have proof that it has happened. I have a picture I have posted it on Facebook wondering why it‚Äôs happening but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs happening to other people but it‚Äôs clearly happening to me so something is wrong with the app right now | This app needs to be added to Apple car play android has it on their phones but not for Apple this needs fixed | ko t·ªët | Why would you have the option to delete or unsend your sent message that you didn‚Äôt mean to send but sent and can‚Äôt undo it anymore?????!!! Fix this | Los videos no se envian ni se ven | This is a predatory business strategy. Flat out. The implication of this being that if I refused to update my phone I would be artificially locked out of using certain features, not because of a compatibility issue, but because They just can. | Honestly it would be fine except for the amount of spammer/scammers that are always trying to get ur info thru it. It‚Äôs insane. I never use it anymore and much prefer just using a google voice number and being able to text freely thru it since people have no way of knowing it‚Äôs not ur real number. But messenger is the number one way to get ur account on FB hacked so if somehow you been under a rock for years and are just now seeing this‚Ä¶be careful on messenger. You will get ur fb account hacked 7/10 times if using this‚Ä¶ | Be original and stop REQUIRING everyone to do an update just to get the same idea and concepts that we already have on instagram and tik tok. Let the two be its own individual accounts. | Please fix it why always asking me confirm my phone number and access my contact. I will increase star if it fixed. Thank. Now I can‚Äôt send videos from my iPhone 12 Pro Max to any my friends. | Everytime you guys do an update something is always messing up rather it‚Äôs the chats or if it‚Äôs the stories it‚Äôs always something . | For a messenger app it‚Äôs fine. Easy to find folks and send a message to them. I also like that they support video calls so I don‚Äôt have to give my number out when using Marketplace. I just wish it had a filter to show you all unread messages. Ever since the last update mine always shows I have one unread but I have opened every chat I have and I can‚Äôt get it to go away. | I don't receive my notifications even though my notifications turned on. On the plus side, I like the themes usually. Maybe add more though. | Cheaters you looser dirty dog right place for you to hang out at | App is trash I just updated it last week and now it‚Äôs forcing me to do it again against my will just like last week üò† | Where is the background themes? Its gone! | Ont allow  me to update the
 messanger app. Has someone else‚Äôs Apple ID to log in. Not familiar with the Apple ID.! | When someone sends me a voice message it‚Äôs like the speed is turned on high. It‚Äôs been like this for weeks and hasn‚Äôt been fixed and I can‚Äôt fix it. But other then that I love this app | Just updated and now doesn‚Äôt work. | After doing the most recent update I now need to create a 6-digit pin to keep my chat history. This is the worst thing you could do!!! We have passwords and two factor authentication for a reason!!! This needs to go away!!!!! | Should really be updated to have CarPlay functionality, it‚Äôs been available on android for a good while now. WhatsApp has it too. | Recently my app stopped notifying me whenever I got a message. It‚Äôs not on DND or silent and it only works briefly if I uninstall and reinstall. This will be my third time. Really hope they fix this glitch | I feel like they should bring back the chat heads for iPhone users, that‚Äôs the only thing I miss about having an android lol. We need head chats back! | Why doesn‚Äôt the app have the option to delete multiple chat threads at once?? With the amount of scammers and fake profiles that message us constantly it takes way too much time to delete all those random messages. Please add this feature! | my messenger app confuses notifications received from spam with the notifications from home page. so one spam message counts as 2.

Anytime, I have to search for a rental, it‚Äôs like finding a needle in a haystack.
I keep going over the same properties over and over and then just give up and book a hotel. Lol. | Six of us traveled together and booked an airbnb. Three out of six come home with bedbug bites. I provided clear photos to customer support seeking for a solution, but they refuse to step in, claiming unless I have photos of the bedbug, they can‚Äôt do anything. Knowing bedbug bites takes few days to show plus we had a short trip, this seem like Airbnb is protecting the host. We stepped back and said if they can‚Äôt issue any refund, at least temporarily suspend the host to protect other users. Airbnb refuses again. So travelers, don‚Äôt use airbnb ‚Äî your safety is NOT protected!! Go get a hotel room instead | Our family booked a condo in Cambridge Ma March 13-17.  The owner Adam was not allowed to do short term rentals in this building (Airbnb‚Äôs).  I have evidence showing this from the building owner and management.  The apartment was extremely dirty and had a horrible smell.  Airbnb asked for proof.  So I returned to the apartment and took timestamp photos.  The owner(Adam) disputed the claims/photos.  Saying I doctored the photos.  Airbnb refused to provide a refund.  I would NOT use Airbnb. | I have been a loyal airbnb customer for 5 years. I will never use airbnb again. I heard people say they dont like airbnbs because they are never clean . Now I see what everyone means. My last 3 airbnbs have been disgusting and each time it gets worse. The worse part about airbnb  is they take the HOST side before the consumer and we pay all the money. They don‚Äôt compensate you for the dirty and unsafe listing. Airbnb support told me my host was being to kind for refunding me for the days after I cancel my airbnb ! As she should because I wont be there !!!! The blatant disrespect has lost a loyal customer. Airbnb should be ASHAMED ! | I rented an apartment and I got a notice of the host not paying rent. When I contacted air bnb they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything! I paid way more than the actual rent, since I had the bill, and was shocked to know Air Bnb couldn‚Äôt do a thing! I had to handle it with my host, is what they said. Why do I pay a service fee then? How can you allow someone to post a rental if it‚Äôs not paid for on the host side? The customer service has gone downhill dramatically in the last year. So many issues with so many properties and they never help. After 6 years I am done with this app. Hotels at least are more accountable than this platforms and it‚Äôs rentals. | So Awesome | This company is a scam, it has absolutely no customer service. I have several issues with the app itself and for a stay I did using the app. I am chatting on the app and random people come and say they will work on the case but fee mins later they are gone and no updates for several days. Chat bot keeps asking do you still need help but that dumb bot doesn't see that airbnb has done nothing. I have called and talked to actual people but they say they will work but nothing is done by them as well. I previously reported issue to executive team and that person said let me work on it and get back to you but it has been more than a month and no one has responded. Disgusting app experience and with the staff of airbnb | I have used airbnb for years. They decided to remove my account with no further explanation, asked for an appeal and the information they based this decision on. Just denied my appeal and removed my account unfairly. This app was great, has been horrible this past year. | Don‚Äôt download this. For some reason it needed a card put in then it took $22 from my account. Very annoying | after years of dealing with discrimination, terrible customer service, rates above market price, and a platform that puts its hosts above its guests, I just had my last negative experience. Verbo and hotels.com are better in every way. | They don‚Äôt care anymore. 
Customer service will leave you hanging with no way to escalate issue to upper management. 

What are we suppose to do now | I had decent experience with airbnb. My issue comes in with the ‚Äúreview‚Äù system. I don‚Äôt feel it is fair that the app urges us to give the host a good review or it won‚Äôt be posted, but the host can write a bad review about the customer and it gets posted with no issues. Plus we have to ‚Äúdispute‚Äù a negative review through support which takes forever if it even happens. It‚Äôs very dishonest and unfair to current and future users. All reviews about the host should be posted, good or bad because all reviews get posted about the customer no matter if it‚Äôs good or bad. I will not use the app anymore because of this. I deleted my account. | Verification system threw up random error messages on browser when trying to verify phone number.
Then after I try on the app it says I can‚Äôt confirm for 24 hours?!
Talked to customer service representative but they were VERY unhelpful. | I have used Airbnb for 6 years. On 4 different occasions I have booked an Airbnb 5+ months out from my scheduled trip and then had the hosts cancel on me right before. This year, Airbnb allowed the host to cancel on me 2 days before my trip leaving me to panic and scramble to find a new one. I tried numeorus times reaching out for assistance and got nothing in return. I can no longer rely on Airbnb, there is no point in booking one since hosts can cancel whenever. The hosts have too much power and Airbnb does nothing to protect or assist renters. | Just felt bitter about recent encounter with Airbnb. I had an excursion planned in Europe and my flight was cancelled in Amsterdam‚Äôs ‚Äî thanks KLM. I didn‚Äôt make a flight and Airbnb would not try to workout a deal and charged $250+ even though it wasn‚Äôt our fault.
Peace, 
Max | Idk what I would do without airbnb honestly ! Wether it's for traveling , work, vacation, or lifestyle good or bad! It's definitely worth booking through, no resort fees or security deposits ! | 2 of the last 3 times I used AirBnB, the listings seriously misrepresented the property. One claimed to have 3 bathrooms; in actuality the property had only 1 toilet. The other claimed to be oceanfront / beachfront; in actuality it was ~1 or 2 blocks from the beach. (The 3rd one was honest and wonderful). 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll use AirBnB again. It‚Äôs a risk. Owners seem fine with making stuff up and AirBnB seems not to have any mechanism to ensure accurate listings, they try to get you to ‚Äúwork it‚Äù with the owner. | When things go wrong your on your own.  They will not protect you and you will not get your money back, we call this a scam in business.  
What a joke.  They used to be good but now have no moral compass.  Sad. | I had a host accept my alternate stay and she never refunded my money back. I called Airbnb Support and she didn‚Äôt respond to them. I lost out on $687.09 . The Customer Service is in India so you will not get any help with that either. If the host withheld your refund, the host can negotiate what they want to give back. This is company is not about the customer it‚Äôs about the host. | I don‚Äôt know how people afford to book Airbnbs anymore. The fees are just out of control. Between the cleaning and booking fees, it‚Äôs literally half the price if you stay at a hotel.  Airbnb please reign this in and go back to basics. As far as the app, filtering options are limited‚Ä¶and quite inaccurate. If I search for waterfront, I‚Äôm not interested in your property that‚Äôs a 1 mi drive to the water. üôÑ | At lease at a hotel you can hold someone accountable and/or get a refund if the host doesn‚Äôt hold up their end of the deal. AirBnB does not have any interest in your complaints or concerns. The rental could be completely wrong, full of bugs, mold, and you will be stuck for the duration. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, just research AIRBNB nightmares and you‚Äôll find that this organization is completely corrupt and the hosts are more often than not dishonest in their listings and Airbnb does not verify that listings are as advertised. A scheme all the way to the top. I lost months of funds while traveling due to booking extended stays at a string of listings that fell very short of expectation, including the bugs and mold. It was too late once I realized that no matter what listing I ended up at, none of them were as advertised and the company told me too bad. Video evidence, pictures. Didn‚Äôt matter. They just assumed it was in bad faith. They tell you to settle it on site with the host. They‚Äôll tell you the host has THE ENTIRE DURATION of your stay to resolve the issue. Even if they make no effort to resolve the complaint, it still counts. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. | Why do you hide addresses? I‚Äôm trying to book a place and I want to look up on a map how close it is to trails. Your built in map doesn‚Äôt show the trails so I need the address to look on a trail map. In the end I didn‚Äôt book through this app. Hiding the address is shady! Hotels don‚Äôt hide their address. I booked a hotel instead! Completely stupid business model! | The idea that Airbnb allows their host to charge crazy high cleaning fees is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to charge a daily cleaning unless you are cleaning daily!!!

Airbnb needs to get rid of the cleaning fees and let the hosts build that price into their rental rates - just like a hotel. | Why is it that I can‚Äôt use the app I have. If I can‚Äôt download new one it seems wrong to force me to upgrade to a new phone. | Air bnb used to be a good option, but now since all air bnb‚Äôs charge $200 plus cleaning fees on top of all the other fees, and built in rules‚Ä¶. Requiring you to clean‚Ä¶. It lost its luster. At least at hotels you don‚Äôt have to clean and you also get free breakfast. | Airbnb used to be so much better - now the customer service is non existent, with any problems you will be speaking to a robot, and my last 3 cases I spent useless hours and nothing was ever resolved! Pull it together Airbnb! No more robots for customer service - give us Real and logical humans! | Limited trust and safety. Multiple scams ongoing related to insufficient host/ fraud checks. Constantly see reviews purporting scams and false placements. | Their host are always so awful. they all just wanna steal your money. horrible app do not recommend. They will try to charge you on top of the total price. overall a horrible app. | Worst experience staying somewhere of my life. $20/night apt and the hosts never settled on how to pay for it. Then pressed charges when stuff was missing from her apartment after I left it in perfect condition minus a used towel. | After arriving at Arthur's condo in Phoenix we requested to cancel because it was the most unsafe area we had ever tried to stay while using Airbnb. I consistently use this service while traveling for work. After the poor and lack of communication from air bnb I will most likely not use this service anymore. 
To give an example the parking lot of the condo and surrounding area was littered with drug addicts dealers and what seemed to be a tent city across the street. I highly recommend not staying here. I'm from the South Side of Chicago and didn't want to get out of the car if you know what I mean. 
There has been no support from air bnb and we will be contacting our credit card company for a refund. | I came to the Airbnb service so that I would not have to worry about finding a place to live. I found 2 ads and both turned out to be fraudulent. How do you keep the service clean? I don't want to look anywhere for housing, I'm ready to pay extra for airbnb service. They are trying to deceive me, at first they tried to take me to their third-party site, then they say that the ad I chose is unavailable, the room is occupied, they offered another one for $ 300 more expensive. Well, I agreed, now they ask to be contacted by phone before confirming the reservation. I am dissatisfied with the Airbnb service, I will never use it again and I will not recommend it to anyone. | I‚Äôve had continual issues with Airbnb over the last year, I can never reserve anything with a vague ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù error. Tried on multiple browsers and multiple devices until I inevitably get a ‚Äútoo many attempts message‚Äù. | Too much expensive . Booking hotel seems to be better than Airbnb | I went to Spokane from Ohio for my sons, chemotherapy treatments me and my wife and my son, when we first got there, we booked under my wife‚Äôs account and ended up having to leave the first Airbnb. We were at because of family emergencies and they needed their home and so we booked a different day well the night after we got there I got a notification from our Host stating that Airbnb canceled our reservation and we needed to leave immediately. I didn‚Äôt understand why so my wife went into her account to check to see what happened and they completely removed her account and said that we were partying even though they had no proof or evidence because we weren‚Äôt. Well, we asked for a refund for the rest of the nights because we spent $900 and they kept saying they would escalate our case escalate. Our case never contacted us back never put the account back up and never gave us a refund for our money. Well, we went and booked an Airbnb under my name on my account and ended up getting robbed. All of our belongings got stolen and Airbnb helped us with rebooking we rebooked the Airbnb. We had the hot tub didn‚Äôt work so we wanted to go somewhere else. They issued us a coupon and the second they issued all those coupons to my account, they sent me an email stating they were removing my account from the platform for party risk of partying, again with no evidence and no warning at all and now they are refusing to talk to us at all and I just lost over $900 again which is totaling out to about $1900 that we‚Äôve lost within the last week and now they refuse to give us our accounts back or even a gift voucher with the amount on it so we could get somewhere else to stay. Do not book with Airbnb. They will scam you. | Mario is been the best host you can ever find, this is the second time using his house and his responses are fast and efficient, thank you Mario | I have been utilizing Air bnb since its inception and I will tell you that it is the hosts that define the quality of this product and not the app.  That being said, the Airbnb app is now the most convenient tool  to find alternatives to hotels in the travel biz.  I do find google search to run a close second to this app and find google infinitely easier to use- such that I find many Airbnb on google then get the details on Airbnb app.  

I still find Airbnb format, codes and operation extraordinarily ineffective in getting the whole picture.  Even many reviews reveal hidden codes as ‚Äúcozy bed‚Äù meaning its rented for 2 people but its not even a queen bed -or- ‚Äúrustic‚Äù surroundings meaning a junkyard is on the same block as where you are staying. 

Also, app navigation has never been that intuitive. I still find myself vetting stuck in places and starti g the app over. It is as if they never really knew what a ‚Äúback button‚Äù was. 

In the end, I have had many good experiences and one or two exceptional ones, all being because the host made it so. 

March 2020 entry

The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities ü§™ . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version .... Whoever released this needs to roll it back up! I have attempted to book stays with complete frustration and mix ups. The app has reversed it performance of user ease. Avoid this new version.... | It said to update so I did and now it‚Äôs just a black screen | $300 a night? lol, don‚Äôt forget $160 Airbnb fees, $150 taxes, and of course the $250 cleaning fee. Airbnb rates are a joke and so many renters know it and offer their properties on other sites or on personal pages for much less. I doubt you‚Äôll ever find your best deal here. | Airbnb refused to give my handicap mother a refund, even though the property we tried to rent from Stuart Morley was not handicap accessible! There wasn't even room for my mom's wheelchair anywhere and we only stayed a few days out of the 25 that we reserved. Airbnb has this individual to steal from us with no ability to recover the money and the trip interruption insurance they offer is worthless too, and didn't cover anything! Don't ever use this service or you'll lose your money and never be able to get it back. They purposely allow people that they are being prejudiced towards handicap people to continue to be on there and make money from their service. Airbnb is a bunch of thieves. | Since New update, the app will not open on my phone. Just rotates the app symbol. | Most of my personal travel is with my four-legged friend. It is so much easier and less expensive to use AirBNB instead of hotel chains.  Occasionally I use it for business travel when I am looking for a specific area and can‚Äôt find a hotel. | I had always heard from friends how Airbnb scams its customers and it happened to me too. I was held responsible for existing damages in a cabinet and was charged $150 for the chipped corner paint. I have many other friends telling me how the hosts show repair documentation and they go and proceed to over charge for existing damages in a property and they try to hold you responsible for it. | THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY, AS LONG AS THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU. NARROWLY ESCAPED A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I recently experienced a concerning situation during a reservation with Airbnb, prompting me to share a cautionary tale with fellow users. Regrettably, my experience has led me to conclude that Airbnb‚Äôs commitment to customer safety may not align with their public image. Despite raising genuine safety concerns during my stay and providing detailed information, the response from Airbnb‚Äôs support team exhibited a lack of thorough consideration and logical coherence. The decision-making process appeared flawed, with the introduction of logical fallacies and an apparent disregard for the gravity of the issues raised. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Airbnb‚Äôs customer service, as it seems the platform prioritizes financial transactions over the safety and well-being of its users. Consequently, I have chosen to discontinue using Airbnb for future accommodations. I urge potential users to exercise caution when considering Airbnb for their lodging needs. While the platform may offer a wide array of options, my unfortunate commitment to addressing safety concerns promptly and responsibly. It is essential for users to be aware that Airbnb‚Äôs customer support may fall short of expectations when faced with issues that require careful consideration and thorough investigation. The logical fallacies evident in their response, including appeals to ignorance, non sequiturs, and hasty generalizations, highlight a concerning lack of rigor in their decision-making process. Such lapses in reasoning raise questions about the reliability of Airbnb‚Äôs customer support and their ability to handle situations that involve safety and security. In light of these experiences, I strongly caution potential users against relying solely on Airbnb for their lodging needs. Exploring alternative accommodation options with a reputation for prioritizing customer safety and providing robust support mechanisms might be a more prudent choice. While Airbnb has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel and seek accommodations, my recent encounter has revealed a disconcerting aspect of their customer service that cannot be overlooked. As consumers, our safety and well-being should remain paramount, and I believe it is crucial to consider these factors when choosing a platform for lodging arrangements. In conclusion, my recommendation is to approach Airbnb with caution and to carefully evaluate their commitment to safety and customer support. It is my hope that this review serves as a reminder for users to prioritize platforms that consistently uphold the highest standards of service and safety. | App is very easy to use | It is nice to book and enjoy experiences but let‚Äôs hope nothing detrimental occurs because they have no resolution or policies for refunds | I used to love using Airbnb, now there is a ridiculous amount of fees added at the end and the total ends up being 3 or 4 times the advertised price. This kind of false advertising is very disappointing as Airbnb used to be much more transparent. There is a button you can select that gives you a closer number to what you will ultimately pay.  But I don‚Äôt like being tricked into a false sense of security by these fake prices. | To be clear, LOVE the service. This review is of the app's usability as a visually impaired person.

Text (as in 'how to get in' messages) cannot be zoomed in on. Nor can it be copied by a long press. This forces you into all sorts of cludgy work-arounds.

As noted, love the service but make the app more user friendly. | I‚Äôm a host with three years‚Äô experience on Airbnb. In general, it was OK, but when I got a scammer guest who reserved in the wrong place and then lied and said my place was dirty, in order to cancel the reservation and get her money back, the support from Airbnb customer service was terrible. Though I was a ‚ÄúSuperHost‚Äù with all five-star ratings, they believed the guest and gave her all her money back.
I recently tried returning to Airbnb but found the customer service is still inadequate. They give you the runaround endlessly, seemingly trying to wear you out, rather than help you. I am done with hosting on Airbnb. I recommend using FurnishedFinder.Com. They don‚Äôt take a percentage of your rent, but rather a yearly fee of about $150. | If you get a bad air bnb rental don‚Äôt expect any help from air bnb. Scammers! | AirBnB is one of those services that when it works well and everyone involved is being honest is wonder but the moment you have a disreputable host you can lose a massive amount of money. I had a host mislead me on a listing and when I found out less than 48 hours later and attempted to cancel I was met with a 900 dollar cancelation fee, when I tried to contact AirBnB I was met with a we will reach out to the host and the host refused to give me my money back. Airbnb told me that it was up to the host who had mislead me in the listing to begin with. The real shame is that there are good and honest hosts but the fact that predatory ones are allowed to continue doing business makes it impossible for me to even consider continuing business with them.",4.7789,631511,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/dd/18/5b/dd185ba4-eaf9-4723-8f1e-ef81256b6702/affe9d16-12fb-4e90-bd72-2aef6db64875_A-iPhone-55-1_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/37/c7/65/37c76512-ed84-9f33-9abd-c2ff89cd82d4/aa7d1730-888d-4d4c-8740-072743767f11_A-iPhone-55-2_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/be/10/87/be1087a7-7ddc-643e-0eb2-248031384145/c4c9b288-b49a-463d-a76f-65b74ddf2689_A-iPhone-55-3_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f8/b6/b9/f8b6b9e2-195b-f4ef-cc7e-97438c2d53de/75604421-7b0a-43d5-bcd7-b3ca0ad853cd_A-iPhone-55-4_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/16/ae/a4/16aea4b8-8aff-de00-5938-b27c4985aae7/621b1af3-ef01-48c2-b187-fc48c27fd6af_A-iPhone-55-5_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/21/ae/6b/21ae6b47-4614-3551-aafb-e56015930660/92b9924c-eb2c-44bf-b6d3-dc9b319a013f_A-iPhone-55-6_en-US.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/99/d8/f0/99d8f0ad-31f8-6485-5651-e9b2dbfed177/2dd66dcd-28d7-4f52-a6c0-042cdb24fbc1_iPad-1_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/63/2a/03/632a03a3-7657-a304-89b1-2676ff054eee/172d6926-d10f-4027-972f-e5e2c9175158_iPad-2_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7d/f6/5a/7df65a00-67f3-15bc-c7bb-1f3d3bdbb745/755327b4-e398-42dd-9b06-46a1067e23a1_iPad-3_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f5/b9/55/f5b9555f-033b-c4a5-f54d-ab347b4411cf/7ea8755e-16f5-42b5-b865-e019cb12fc58_iPad-4_en-US.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

You‚Äôre the best! | Love using my app, it‚Äôs quick it‚Äôs easy! | Anthony Jefferson Great Job! | I use this app pretty regularly. Today I needed to add a new payment method and each time I try, I get an error message. Maybe this happened after the latest update? It pretty annoying and since I don‚Äôt have time to walk around the store, I‚Äôll have to place a pick order elsewhere. | Gift card option did not show up in payment options | Thanks great service Easy to navigate | But so far so good | Love Walmart ! | This store does not enforce the scan and go. Those of us who pay for the service are forced to stand in line with people who don‚Äôt. | There are only about 20% of self checkouts open. I always have to squeeze in to scan at a regular register or wait 10min in line to do self checkout. It‚Äôs like the store doesn‚Äôt understand you have subscribers that pay to for convenience. They focus on regular checkouts at this store. | I received my orders in 3-4 days now in the Virgin Islands‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Ordering from the Virgin Islands used to take two weeks to receive my order. | 2nd Order: Same day delivery and no missing items so far. | Done with ordering online, done with the app. Put in an order. Then Walmart cancelled it and then wants me to do a new password. I don't trust one thing about Walmart anymore buying online. Deleted the app. BEWARE!!! | Whoever works for getting orders ready needs to do a better job of looking for products there‚Äôs been A LOT of times where they don‚Äôt and I literally have to go to the store and then they end up having the product. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer and I‚Äôm tired of being nice about things when people aren‚Äôt doing their JOB correctly! I‚Äôve spent way too much money with the company! | After every addition from my list, the ads and 'recommendations' freeze the app and cause me to restart the scrolling to add the next item. Gonna use the browser as the 'developers' of this mess are not the brightest. Do better, for goodness sake - you don't have to monkey amazon's descent into customer hatred. | Great option to going in the store. Thanks! | The Walmart delivery service has been an absolute game changer. The amount of time and sanity saved each weekend avoiding the dreaded grocery store crowds, has added a skip to my step. The only gripe I have is that some items seem to be permanently out of stock online even though I know they are available in the store. Ok, maybe 2 critiques Walmart, there are a few items we buy every week that do not exist on your website even though again, I know you sell them in your store. My husband‚Äôs coffee creamer being one of them. He has to go to our local store to purchase. I realize we can‚Äôt all be perfect, but I‚Äôm wondering if these glitches can be fixed? Thanks for listening! | Bug that brings up ‚Äúscreen calibrate‚Äù distrusts experiences and locks tablets. This has been here for quite a while. Does not look like a priority to fix. Also new products and Walmart Exclusives are not on app. | I had $63.00 in my cart and the total for the purchase was $63.00 after taxes and when I placed the order it quickly changed to $78.00 for no reason and on the next confirmation screen it showed that it changed to $78.00 Walmart is now skimming you of extra money hoping you will not notice. We will stop using this app since their committing petty larceny and they know they cannot be prosecuted for this. | Why is my $4 Walmart cash not being applied to the final amount. It shows up in the estimate but not in the final | Super convenient and great prices!!!  I love that you can speak to a customer service person if you have questions or concerns!!! | Should not advertise stuff online for a price $20 or more cheaper than in store and then not price match at the counter, and or, if you go to the app and buy it YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP and not wait on the ‚Äúsystems 3 hour window‚Äù. Garbage.
Atleast be able to go to customer service and have them scan it through the system. Waste of time, target is nicer. | When will delivery be available to Poor House rd Rustburg? | I ordered a small refrigerator from a 3rd party seller. Was given a tracking number. Item was marked as delivered to front desk, I was home the second it was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù. No fridge in site. No neighbors got it. Nearby apartment building didn‚Äôt get it at their desk. Went to post office. Wasn‚Äôt there. Post office checked the tracking number and found it was delivered and originated from completely different addresses. I was given the wrong tracking number. Tracking details also showed it as a small box, not a fridge.

Went to contact seller to be at correct tracking number, their entire store page is gone. No way to contact them.

Went back to post office to see if they pull up any active tracking numbers going to my address. None, their history shows one I ordered a few weeks ago. Zero current active deliveries to my address. 

I was scammed.

Presented this evidence to Walmart, but since it shows delivered on their end, they sided with the scammer. An obvious scam and they failed to see it. Must be an overseas scammer at working for Walmart‚Äôs customer service by day. A common occurrence in overseas call centers. Research it.

Anyway I‚Äôm out $200 and really needed that refrigerator. | Walmart is the best! I love the store and app. Everything works great. | I have two bad knees and it‚Äôs hard for me to walk around. All I have to do is pick up my phone and shop! | I ordered two dresses that were $10 apiece. The only size they had wasn‚Äôt 5X and I just thought maybe I would use them for an over shirt to go to bed. I wear a 2X these 5X dresses that I got won‚Äôt even go over my shoulders. How do I get a refund, would it be easier just to take them to the store? | Ever since one of the more recent updates, there‚Äôs no notifications! Not even an option for them in phone settings! Bring them back, please! 

Otherwise the app is great. | I was charged with a location surcharge of $201.60, which is double the price of the total amount of items I‚Äôve bought! This is insane! I will never order online from Walmart again! | Shopping at Walmart app is easy and always a great value | Terrible so far but better than Amazon. | I cannot believe I just now realized all the services available on the Walmart app. Doing 30-day trial and I‚Äôm already hooked! The design and ease of use of the app is AMAZING. I order almost everything online and this is one of my go-to‚Äôs now for sure!!! Highly recommend and I can‚Äôt say enough how the design of the app is stellar in so many ways! Thank you!!! | I don‚Äôt understand why Walmart can‚Äôt price match since I order the same item online but in store it was 10 dollars more, I like target more because they will price match when it sold through them | They keep putting items in my cart. If I don‚Äôt notice, then I end up buying unnecessary products. This should be illegal! | 459.3 Mb for a shopping app! Looks like a lot of data mining? | I updated my app and now the notifications option is gone.

Brian Skwirsk | I can order what I want from the comfort of my home. | I love the Walmart app and pick up service. Started using it during the pandemic when it was a lifesaver and have continued using it when I need a time saver. Pick up service depends on the location you use and I have had a few minor problems here and there but as a general rule, very few issues with missing items or substitutions. | Not worth it anymore. Half of the items are out of stock online all the time! If I‚Äôm paying for a Walmart subscription make it worth having it!! Very annoying and fustrated | Live live love y‚Äôall | Deber√≠an poner una opci√≥n donde se pueda traducir al espa√±ol, tambi√©n deber√≠an resolverle mejor al cliente | Great price. | Got Walmart plus and twice now they have delivered my stuff to the wrong address.

Here‚Äôs the main reason why if you were a valuable customer like I have been in spend a good amount of money with this company and the one time you have fraudulent activity on your account and someone tries to take $1000 from your account, they hang you out to dry for a week with no updates whatsoever on the case and when you email to ask for an update they have no idea they just say that their case investigators are working on it but they can‚Äôt get you an update. How can you not update a customer on a situation that is pretty important like $1000 theft ridiculous I would do DraftKings over FanDuel any day nothing but horrible experiences with customer service and trying to get this resolved. | Every thing is good but for the money I spend I should have won a couple jackpots by now but the glitching makes me feel like I should have won like on willywonka the game got stuck and every time you back out you lose your wining streak and we useed to get 30 dollar bonus here and there and now we don‚Äôt get no bonuses just if we spend 50 we get 10 now we‚Äôre real close to stop playing the site we spent like six grand and one 1200 | Scammers | Says 17+ but you have to be 18 to bet‚Ä¶ hmm | Love the app but my friend always gets a deposit match where is mine it‚Äôs been years? | great set up experience so far. looking forward to long term usage of this app! | For some reason I the app kept logging me out in the middle of bets, message stated that it logged me out because of in activity but I was clearly betting every hand. It did this to me 4 times | App is grass watch your points an shot clock they don‚Äôt give you the right time they watch you betting patterns after awhile you get odds an numbers were you will never win be aware | FD unaware there are many apps better. All it takes is pissing off a customer to send them elsewhere | I love fan duel | The customer service employees are not willing to help with any issues or problems you have with your account. I couldn‚Äôt recommend them any less | Bien | Great site | FanDuel had trouble authenticating my account and the customer service was no help. I told them the questions they were asking did not pertain to me and they reset the SAME set of questions and asked me to answer them again. Every other betting app I‚Äôve used has never had this issue. I unfortunately will not be betting with FanDuel. | Do not use this app, authenticating questions never prompt, you will be stuck if you‚Äôre in Connecticut or many other states. 0/10 for March madness | App is known to be scammy and rigged. After playing everyday for almost 2 years I‚Äôm yet to win over 500 in a single session. Every other app I use in able to win. They claim it‚Äôs fair and regulated but I can confirm for 1000% THE SLOTS ARE BOT FAIR AND REGULATED | Not enough bonuses plus I always only get 10 risk free at least 25 dollars once and a while I spent a lot of money | Hey everyone if you are willing to play you can play but day by day you become addiction to this and not only that more chances to loos more than win so be careful. | Thank you I love the deposit bonus | Easy and simplicity all in the palm of my hand | WORST SPORTS BOOK OUT THERE, they will take your money and have retards working the support | I can be consistently playing, and only when I‚Äôm winning, does my computer say? Do you want to log back in? I could understand if I hadn‚Äôt played for a while, but I am consistently inconstantly, pressing the spin button, and it only does it when I‚Äôm winning! | Recommended by emulator it doesn‚Äôt work but they sure did sponsor you | THEY LEAVE YOU FOR WEEKS TALKING TO A BOT, THEY DISABLE THE ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL | A great app and the best one out there for sports bettors as far as I‚Äôm concerned. The only thing is the book will shift lines when you become a sharp bettor and they will limit your bonuses and rewards once you win or don‚Äôt bet for a while. Draft kings is also great but Fam Duel is definitely leading the pact. But the app and the company tend to be greedy. | Couldn‚Äôt be more easier | I have more losses then wins but the more I learn it‚Äôs enjoy y‚Äôall saved my bank with last minute betting.

FanDuel one of the most used betting apps used by me and my budds.
Making fun while it lasts‚Ä¶ ü§ëü´£üòéü§ù | It‚Äôs ok I just dont get any deposit matches | Having alot of problems with the app 
Can‚Äôt save any of my bets 
As of right now I can‚Äôt even place a bet idk why but it‚Äôs weird | It‚Äôs easier to use | And I know they won‚Äôt show this cause they hide all the bad reviews so let‚Äôs give them fake stars literally they take all the money people lose on the casino to cover their sportsbook losses it‚Äôs sad read the reviews from real people who lose nonstop it‚Äôs a joke there‚Äôs literally only way to win on FanDuel and that‚Äôs if your new and it‚Äôs hot than enjoy but the minute you see it slow up run I use to hit the major on endless treasure on .88 üòÇ seriously but now I can‚Äôt even win .88 but that‚Äôs from when I first started I don‚Äôt know why yall write back and say it‚Äôs random this is app is robbing people ‚Ä¶.. scammmmmmmmmmmmers trash app they lie cheat and steal | For both tennis and ping pong, i want to see the number of sets or game won currently from each player. I don‚Äôt want to have to read scores of individual games to determine the sets or games each player has won. | Cumbersome to use rewards | FanDuel üî•üí∞ | Great app love placing bets and making money | I‚Äôve had this app for about a year now. It is by far the best sports-betting app out there; HOWEVER, the location feature is so annoying that I don‚Äôt even bother opening the app unless I‚Äôm already in an eligible state. Picking which state I‚Äôm currently inis  already so stupid to me, but it also must check my location EVERY TIME I SWITCH TO ANOTHER APP ON MY PHONE WHICH MAKES THIS APP A HARD PASS. I do not understand why my location is not simply checked ONLY when opening the app and or placing the bet. If I switch to text someone on my phone, then when I revisit the fanduel app it‚Äôs starts checking my location again. Like, why?? It‚Äôs especially frustrating when not in a betting state, and I‚Äôm trying to get my selections lined up for later when I am in an eligible location. In all, it‚Äôs one of the most annoying sportsbetting app on the market. | There are some times where you want to make bets early, and then come back to make changes for later. The app has been having many issues with the save bets feature. 

Each time I try to save some bets the message ‚Äúsomething went wrong try again later‚Äù always pops up | A little disappointed | Its getting annoying that everytime im trying to play a slot game or any casino game it wont load and just say error. If not fixed will be deleting this app and going to use a different  casino and sportbook app | The game selection kept me intrigued, excitement and fun for hours!!! | üëç | Hope I can get some | a family member sent me a few dollars to do whatever i wanted with it. when that family member got upset for something entirely different (people get upset for no reason sometimes) they called their bank and had The transaction of them sending me money disputed. and the result was me having my account suspended. the family member wants bad for me since a kid so this was a very sad setup. a childish one as well. i dont need sports book to make money how alot of people act like. so im good off this already rigged application. Im just confused as to why i cant even contact customer service on this serious matter. when at times when i had no job, i would stay up day and night planning a parlay. studying. and doing my best to feed my family.

Best regards. | Cheating and thieving winning on here shouldn‚Äôt be the equivalent of winning the power ball | I‚Äôm writing this because as interesting as this app may seem it‚Äôs not right. Yes you will win be ratio between losing nd winning is vast you lose way more than you win. If you looking to get into this app please save your money because its rigged 100% players are def in on it. It may be robots or clones amongst us because this app will take your money. Worst than lottery | This is awesome! So fun.

Asks if I would like to restore it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the one paying for the service why does it log me out? It‚Äôs so annoying, unnecessary, and stupid to have your customer constantly trying to figure out what happened. Fix your dam app or refund the money you are (at this rate) stealing. | I enjoy the Hulu package but their applications are the worst user experience I've ever dealt with. I use the iPhone app, and Apple TV, but they are all similar. I am just dumbfounded about the guide that only shows details if you are hovering the one row. And when you go to sports the vertical scrolling guide becomes this ridiculous cumbersome horizontal scrolling cards scenario that take FOREVER to get through to find things. | I love Hulu, I do. But I‚Äôm frustrated beyond words because in the past 24 hrs it‚Äôs managed to lose my account not once‚Ä¶but twice. The verification doesn‚Äôt work that was just sent. Says it‚Äôs expired. Why am I being sent an expired code?!?!?! Now I can‚Äôt get in and my account is gone. | This is by far the worst app , horrible , can‚Äôt fill screen, log me out every 5 minutes HORRIBLE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY | There is no clear option to upgrade to a no ads plan. There‚Äôs something about spending double and still seeing some ads but that is not helpful. Congrats I‚Äôm going to read books now. | I‚Äôve never written a review before | Always having connection errors and it‚Äôll tell me it can‚Äôt play a title it was playing for the last hour. Does the same thing on the TV no matter if it‚Äôs updated or on hotspot or internet. I‚Äôve upgraded my internet 3 times to try and fix this problem. Might cancel if problem persist. | What the faq? Choose your ad 3 options all relevant to the same stupid product no one care to be interactive with ads hurry show a dam ad and get me back to my program. | I can‚Äôt watch anything offline that I downloaded | There‚Äôs dragon ball shows but og DB is in Japanese and got is in it to that‚Äôs not my main problem well I want more dragon ball z stuff for example dragon ball movies like fusion reborn of something that‚Äôs all I want dragon ball movies | Worthless app on the ipad.  You literally cannot watch any show, it jumps involuntarily and there is no sound. | Hulu has the shows that I want to watch; however, app on both the phone and smartTV are not the best for streaming. 
It pauses on its own; does not play in certain TVs; have to reload sometimes and that takes forever. 
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not worth $17.99 per month due to it‚Äôs streaming capabilities. 
Other capable streaming services (N) have it figured out and they strive to be the best in this entertainment business!!! | I have been putting in reviews and contacting Hulu about this issue but it seems like they either are ignoring me or don‚Äôt care, they will either reject my review or don‚Äôt post at all. The section where you can continue a show or movie is broken. It does not stop where you‚Äôd pause the show/movie. I can be watching a show and be 5 episodes in, I‚Äôll pause it close out of Hulu but when I come back to continue the show it will say I‚Äôm still on episode 1. The annoying part is what if I don‚Äôt remember where I left off at and now I have to manually search and figure out where to start. For me having to do all that there is no point in having a ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù section when it doesn‚Äôt even work. It‚Äôs frustrating when Hulu makes updates but can‚Äôt fix the slightest issues. I will keep submitting a review everyday until I‚Äôm heard. | It makes me want to switch services. So many bugs - the shows won‚Äôt load, I‚Äôll have to restart it multiple times, the sound won‚Äôt work. And the UX is so dang frustrating. It‚Äôs not intuitive - even after years of using the app, I still get tripped up. It‚Äôs hard to find my recently watched shows and it takes multiple interactions when it really should have only taken one. I am seriously considering switching. | Hulu live crashes often and very difficult to record and watch sports games. | App is lokey trash but it has mark Cuban yelling at dudes and I think they have minionsü§¢ | Always crashing whenever I put it into MiniPlayer, once I reopen the app and try to resume a tv show it doesn‚Äôt save where I was watching. | Too many ads before and after shows | I don‚Äôt know why but there‚Äôs always an issue with this app now. Terrible | I was told I could reactivate my trial within twenty four hours but I can‚Äôt. I guess alot of people cancel and realize they done have access so they tell you that but it‚Äôs a bold. Face   Lie
 There‚Äôs no where to do so and access was gone in twenty minutes! | Help | Junk app keeps freezing when searching through the menu. | This is the worst app of all the streaming services. I get things downloaded before a flight(which is a huge pain in itself), and it seems like more often than not, it won‚Äôt have them downloaded when I open it on the plane. Figure it out, Hulu!! | Really good I like it but too many ads I could just go on to youtube for that. Also ads are too long ugh and some are useless! | Make an option to restart tv shows, for all binge watchers | Ive been using Hulu for a few months now. It was working perfectly fine but now it had been bugging nonstop. It skips parts of my shows or movies overall is super buggy. | I like Hulu and all the shows it has but the ads are getting out of control. | Unable to load has shown up for the past 3 updates and is still doing it in this version. Now that Disney is HEAVILY involved, their junk developers came in too to mess everything up. Do NOT expect a developer to respond to any of these criticisms. They think the Joe public are idiots and they‚Äôre much more esteemed and knowledgeable than us. 

Another insight: why is this still an Apple editors choice? Because woke supports woke and we‚Äôre below their standards. | i love the shows on here, but if you paying for a subscription you shouldn‚Äôt have to watch 1:30 minute ads every few minutes. please change pretty please i‚Äôll cancel my subscription pleweeaaaaseeee | Acac | Occasionally it will work on my phone, but never on the iPad. All the updates just make it worse it seems. Most of the shows I watch are on Hulu but the app is just terrible. | THE WORST STREAMING SERVICE. | Over this streaming service that just keeps charging more and more while also putting restrictions. Can‚Äôt believe how many commercials I‚Äôve just watched in a 30 min show, it‚Äôs almost every 5 mins. I‚Äôm done with Hulu. | I might only be a teen but I still don‚Äôt understand why stuff like this app makes it so you have to pay to even use it. No wonder every single rating I can see has either a 1 star or 2 star. I understand your trying to make money but locking everything behind a huge paywall isn‚Äôt how to do it right:/. | It can only ever play one episode at a time before you have to exit the app and open it back up. It also will randomly stop playing whatever your watching. Otherwise good | The app will always freeze after ads play with no issues. 

Do better Hulu. | Can‚Äôt sign up on app or website
Keep get 404 this page does not exist | Most days I‚Äôll open up the app and I won‚Äôt even be able to watch TV until hours later, when Hulu stops having difficulties | it constantly signs me out and i know my password is correct but it makes me reset it. makes me want to cancel hulu.  one star is generous | Tubi has less ads than you and it‚Äôs free | I have a Hulu account and it never lets me login | Won‚Äôt let you cancel subscription, keeps showing a 404 oops page and trying to charge your credit card. | Lately, a few seconds before every ad or before a show ends, the sound completely cuts out. I rewind, and it does it the same way in the exact same place every time. This is very annoying.

Please let there be a yearly option for no ads too please. | Need to fix their bugs immediately. I can‚Äôt watch a single show. It‚Äôs giving me error codes that I have no idea what it means. They finally add the download option but now I‚Äôm getting error 12660. Don‚Äôt know what that means. I can‚Äôt watch ANYTHING. | I enjoy watching shows on hula but lately I have to watch it on my phone; I would rather watch it on my tv but it‚Äôs usually not working for whatever reason. | I can‚Äôt watch anything on this app. It‚Äôs super glitchy and laggy, don‚Äôt get any audio. I tried deleting and reinstalling but that did not work. | I truly don‚Äôt mind the ads on Hulu, but after sitting through 3 minutes of ads, if I rewind 10 seconds to rewatch a second I missed, it forces me to watch all of the ads again. Even if I just got done watching them a minute before. | I used to enjoy Hulu‚Ä¶now there‚Äôs nothing but issues, errors, and crashing. | When choosing a channel to to watch from the Guide, it now goes back to the channel that I had been watching. After going to the Guide again, choosing another channel to watch, it still goes back to the original channel that I had been watching. In order for me to get the the channel that I had chosen to watch, I must press UP and then choose LAST channel‚Ä¶that is the only way to get to a channel from the Guide.

Except for the robot men but otherwise it‚Äôs an amazing app | I was scrolling on TikTok and I wanted to download some new apps and I downloaded this app and I put my birthday which is 3-1-2009 and the app says u have to be +12 to download and I am +12 soooo what are u talking about ??? I do Not recommend !!! It‚Äôs a scam they need to fix this dumb app ASAPPPPP !!!!! CS WHAT !???!!??!?!?!?!?!? | I‚Äôm extremely frustrated and disappointed with this app I am 18 years old born in 2006 I entered my birth date in and it says sorry you are not elligble for this app when it clearly say 12+ on the App Store I was very excited to you this app but it‚Äôs a no for me | this app is so horrible don't get it!!!! | I put in my birthday and it said I‚Äôm not eligible, I was born in 2001 | When I downloaded the app I tried putting in my age and it says sorry it looks like your not eligible to use or something but I won‚Äôt let me put in my birthdate | I love it I'm gonna keep posting more | I love the app. The content is perfectly aligned to my interests.. my only issue is that I can‚Äôt use it in landscape mode. | This app will be the next big social media app. Not only is it fun, easy to use, but it‚Äôs also so easy to interact with the community. So many helpful tips on this app. The only problem I have is how hard it is the grow on the app. Besides that, this app is a perfect 5/5 stars. I would definitely recommend for anybody who was looking for a new social media app to grow on. üòäüíû | I don‚Äôt know why it keeps saying I‚Äôm not eligible I‚Äôm older than 12 and I put in my birthday and it still says I‚Äôm not eligible. I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug or not, but it would be helpful if we got it fixed. | It says that the app only allows 12+ to be on the app and when I put my bday it says, ‚ÄúSorry look like you‚Äôre not eligible for Lemon8‚Ä¶But thanks for checking us out.‚Äù I am 16, yet it‚Äôs denying me access. I tried to delete and redownload, but it still won‚Äôt work even when I try to make it seem like I am older than 16. | So I was just scrolling on TikTok so that I could find a hairstyle for school. This app pops up and I thought ‚ÄúWow this could be really helpful to find hairstyles for school. Everything was fine until the age requirement came up so I put my age and it says you don‚Äôt reach our age requirement. But I'm 16. | So I download it, put in my birthday, and it says I‚Äôm not eligible. So I try putting in a bunch of other random birthdays with different years days and months and it says the same thing. I was looking forward to using it though :( | lemon8 so you need an implement on your app in Settings account then you need an admin privacy settings you need to implement security and permissions and you need an Amber Mint share profile then your knee implement Notification then you need to implement Live you need to implement activity center then you need to implement content preferences then you need implement ad then you need an implement playback then you need to implement language then you need to implement display and you need to implement screen time and you need to implement family pairing and you need to implement accessibility and you need an app at home screen shortcuts Aberman we can be able to download videos on and you need to implement we can freed up space and you need to implement data saver and you need an implement report a problem and you need implement support and you need to implement terms and policy and you need to implement we can switch account and and you can sign out these are the features that Tiktok settings have please implement it for your app so if TikTok does get banned in United States of America, it was showing in the settings on your app and it will be ready so that you can ask your company if they will transfer all the settings features that Tiktok have to your app so do you have the exact same features that Tiktok have so if Tiktok gets banned we have the same features in this other app 100 that TikTok had we were just having a different app called lemon8 | I am 14 years old. I turned 14 around a month ago. This app has been advertised everywhere I see and I wanted to check it out, but as the app says ‚Äò12+‚Äô I was like ok, i‚Äôm 2 years older than the requirements. I downloaded it and when I put in my birthdate information, it told me I was not old enough to have an account.  Yes, I could lie but I refuse to use an app that decides to force me to do the math so I could be 15, 16, or maybe even 18. (I don‚Äôt like math.) | So I got the app like why not? So I did it and it asked for my birthday and I put my birthday and it was like ‚Äúur not eligible for this app‚Äù and I put 2005 and then tried again and it still didn‚Äôt work so I would probably suggest not get this app but if u want u can | Ok so I downloaded the app and the age requirement is 12 + and I‚Äôm 15 so I put in my date of birthday and it says that i don‚Äôt meet the age requirement | i am 14 and the limit is 12+ and i set my birth year as 2009 and it will not let me join. This is stupid and pointless. I rate 1 star because this app is annoying. ugh i do not like this. raging rn. | I said I was born in 2004 and it said I was ineligible and kicked me off the app | I love this app, there really is a real community of people who post what they really are ‚ù§Ô∏è | It says its 12+, yet once in the app i put my birth year and it says i don‚Äôt meet the requirements because im not 18, but it never states i needed to be 18 in flyers, ads, NOT EVEN IN THE APP STORE. Mind you i am 15, so i didn‚Äôt think my age would be the biggest issue here but it is, and after that it doesn‚Äôt let me re access the app no matter what. Fix your app and change the age requirement if its not 12+ like you claim it to be. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE | Okay so first of all I saw this on social media and it looked good,so I downloaded it and when I'm got into the app it asked me for my date of birth, which I put as 2000 and it said I was not eligible for the app o like any other person would do I put my date as 1989 and it still said the same thing so 1 star from me | I love this app so much it has amazing food ideas if I ever need a food idea I go straight to Lemon8 and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint me I totally recommend this app for a more preppy lifestyle. üíÖüèªüòãüòÆ‚Äçüí® | Love love love üòçüòç | I don‚Äôt have to struggle to find things no more | I would love for the developer to comment or fix the issues stated so others can enjoy the app. It‚Äôs not fair to those who want to use it and then not be heard by the person who could actually fix there problems. | I downloaded the app cause I kelp seeing it on Pinterest. And when I tried to put my birthday and when I was born it wouldn‚Äôt let me. Even if I putted 1980. It still wouldn‚Äôt let me. They really need to fix this. | So u put in my birthday and it claims I‚Äôm not eligible even though the app is 12+ and I am older than that. I‚Äôm sure the app is amazing but I‚Äôm unable to sign in because of this bug. PLEASE FIX THIS üòñ | It won‚Äôt even let me log in cause I‚Äôm not eligible just by putting in my birthday I‚Äôm 17!! I don‚Äôt know why it won‚Äôt let me and saying I‚Äôm not eligible if the age limit is 12. | Lemon8 is awesome beside all of the updates there is also some men on here that comment and it makes me uncomfortable. Lemon8 has many things you can look at and I think it great for everyone. As I said beside the creepy men lemon8 is awesome | When I first heard about lemonade 8 it keep popping up and so I downloaded it and once i did I put 2019 November and it says I do not meet age requirement!! I was confused and try a different age and it keep saying the same thing!!! I don‚Äôt know what is happening but I hope it gets fixed soon cause i heard lots of good things ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Of course the developer team only responds to the five star reviews so hopefully this lands on their radar. I‚Äôm not under twelve much over it in fact but when I put in my birthday I am not eligible for some reason. Deleted then redownloaded to the same message. Is it a glitch hope so looked like a fun app please fix! | Best app of my life. It‚Äôs such a light and nice place to go search for things that matters to you. Every post offers amazing and truly valuable tips. Don‚Äôt hesitate. It‚Äôs amazing to be here - mentally, included. | I found this app off of Pinterest I believe it is some glitch with this app the age minimum is 12+ I‚Äôm 13 but it says that I‚Äôm not eligible for this app I even put in my mother birthday but yet it still says that I am not eligible for this app and I think that they should try to fix this sort of glitch or error | It tells me I‚Äôm not eligible for the app and I am born in 2010 | It was horrible, it says on the app that it‚Äôs 12+ but it doesn‚Äôt let you in even if your 15 it said that I was not eligible even though I put 2009 | It says I‚Äôm not eligible every time I put my age in and I‚Äôm over 12 | I am well over the age of 12 and it keeps telling me I‚Äôm not old enough and not letting me in. Please fix this I really want to use this app I think it would be really good. | Hi I think lemon8 is a 2 star rate because it‚Äôs not letting me put in my birthday it‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm eligible for lemon8 all I'm just trying to do is put my birthday in | Good community, great place to make a digital presence & it‚Äôs a very warm sense of community! | It won‚Äôt let me in no matter what age I put. Every time it says I am not eligible for the app (even though I‚Äôve put the age around 20 to get it to work) | I liked using Lemon8, until I tried to log on late tonight after putting my insta, tiktok, and my remission date (which was in 2015) to find my account has been banned. Which It said that I violated the age requirements, which I assure you I am not, which even so, i am way over the age of 12, and the app says that it is rated 12+. Which even putting my tiktok and insta, which, do not show my face and you have to follow me to see, should have done nothing, if it was the date in my bio, that is just crazy. Fix this please. | I am 12 and it did not at al let me go inside the app it said and I quote u do not meet the age requirement I am 12 born in 2011 and it still did not let me in I put and older age and still didn‚Äôt let me please fix this problem | The app is cute | IT SAYS 12+ AND IT WONT LET ME I. I AM 15 | üéÄüéÄüéÄüéÄ | So I got the app because I seen it everywhere and I put my date of birth and my birthday has not passed so right now I‚Äôm 12 but on the app the age requirement is 12 or up and I‚Äôm and going to be 13 and now it won‚Äôt let me get the app so if your birthday has not passed and you are 12 wait for your birthday or make a fake one | I downloaded this app for inspiration on different things, home decor mostly but also productivity etc. This app is honestly no different than tiktok in my opinion. I deleted tiktok years ago because if you comment on one thing it changes your entire algorithm and you can never get it back right. which causes you to see things that are unproductive, depressing etc. This app is the same, the posts are mostly tiktoks reposted. I thought this app would be different but no. I created an account it started an algorithm, all I seen were black people (i am black myself) but what makes this app show me 95% black peoples posts? I deleted my account and as soon as I did it reset the algorithm im like okay perfect, then eventually it started showing me the same stuff even without an account. We do not need another tiktok. APP DELETED | This app looks amazing. I saw it off TikTok and I really want to try it, but it won‚Äôt work. I am 19 years old well above the age requirement and it still won‚Äôt work. It is saying I don‚Äôt meet the requirements for the account.

It will delete my special offers, has a terrible confusing set up that will make you want to go to McDonalds. It‚Äôs as if all the developers decided to make it a literal puzzle, as there are a gagillion unknown little things you have to do in order for your order to turn out somewhat correct. | What a crappy app. I consider myself relatively app savvy but this app is plain junk. Maybe the developer should try using the McDonald‚Äôs app and see what a user friendly app is all about. This app is very buggy and frustrating to use. It‚Äôs one of the worst of all apps. | Stupid | Very user friendly | Not clear on flow of order.
Generally at the end of completing request the submit button is next (BELOW) the summary of chosen item.  It is not.   Instead I‚Äôm making it a combo.  Then go backward to lose order.  Finally after a couple three steps I see how I can pay checkout.  Clumsier flow | App freezed twice and not able to go through paying. Please fix it. | Thi app signs you out then you can‚Äôt log back even when enter your correct password. | This app is extremely confusing, not to mention it keeps popping up messages that are a distraction when placing an order. | Every single time I try using near or at restaurants it goes berserk. Use the website instead, much better.
Don‚Äôt waste time on app, just go to website. | I love the food and app but would like the ability to add thing to my order like I could in person.. I was unable to add jalepeno a to my taco salad as they were not offered as an add on or a sauce. Just small but worth mention. Also wasn‚Äôt able to say extra tomato on salad. | This app works great, you know, when it WORKS. Every 3 times I open the app, I am automatically signed out, then it refuses to let me sign back in. Only fixes I have found are to reinstall the app  (multiple times) or wait multiple days for another chance to login.. | There should be an option to order extra dressing for salad | Wonderful service. I am learning the app!!! | App crashed n logs me out after every online order | Not intuitive. Repeatedly prompted to familiarize myself with the app. | App always freezes up when placing order or trying to navigate through app. It even froze while I was writing review. SMH lol | Not sure where all the 5 star ratings come from. App is updated, running on a brand new iPhone 14, and I can‚Äôt complete an order. It‚Äôs been this way for months. Completely useless app. | This app really struggles to operate, doesn‚Äôt give you errors that makes it difficult to navigate. Maybe a few more test runs would help it out? | Literally unusable because it freezes and crashes all the time and won‚Äôt let you place orders or even select a restaurant | Tried to use the BOGO for breakfast sandwiches but it kept stating error! 
Having offer in the app but not being able to use is not helpful. | This app has not worked properly for my last 3 phones in the past 4-5 years I just redownloaded the app again for the millionth time recently my phone always does it updates automatically I never have this issue with anything else just this, it refuses to work and crashes on me kicks me out of an order I‚Äôm trying to place etc etc makes me not order from Wendy‚Äôs | Wendy‚Äôs app is great, when it works. It glitches a lot. Won‚Äôt allow me to log in; screen refreshes to log in after entering password info. It happens a lot, even after updates that states to fix bug issues. | It‚Äôs 2024 Get Apple Pay it‚Äôs not going anywhere !!!! | A lot of features are missing but Apple Pay is my favorite | This app never works. Two times I try to redeem a sandwich. Both times they say it didn‚Äôt go through. I have to them show my history that I just redeemed it. 

Fraud! | This | Terrible app. Super slow. Had to start over 8 times! | This location can‚Äôt keep their WiFi working or the dining room open hire better people make sure they can read . | In store could not handle offers on cellphone - suggested mobile order to accommodate- terrible way to do business | AOK | People were great. | It‚Äôs so hard to navigate. It‚Äôs not as easy as other burger apps | For some reason, always problems to the point where I haven‚Äôt been to wendys in a long time because I can go other places and just tap in my order and go pick it up but not Wendys. I have the correct password. I always have to create a new password and then I still can‚Äôt get in. I can never get in with the regular password.

Now this is the first time I actually got to order something I wasn‚Äôt even going to order anything. I was just trying to set up the app.
It asked me the CVR code or whatever code it is like every time I order I have to put that in?

Thank you and your cream sickle shake is delicious | The Interface is a bit clunky and slow. As of March, 2024, The iPhone App doesn‚Äôt allow payment via ApplePay, which is inconvenient. | Inarguably the worst fast food app. Points always disappear even if you just visited last week. It constantly signs you out of your account. It‚Äôs incredibly unstable and will crash for just about any small thing. The loading times are also terrible and have removed some of the customization options that used to be available. I‚Äôve given this app YEARS to clean up the mess before leaving a review and it only has gotten more and more disappointing. Even right now, I‚Äôve spent over 30 minutes trying to make one order because the app keeps crashing. If you‚Äôre not trying to take advantage of a coupon, just go to the store unless you‚Äôre willing to go through the app‚Äôs trial and error. | If I‚Äôve bought the chit to get free frosty for the year, shouldn‚Äôt I get them free instead of being scolded for using ‚Äúmore than one offer‚Äù when you tell me about all the other great deals you have for me? | It seems like whenever I need to use the app.   It never works.   This dont happen on other fast food apps | Worst app I ever worked with | This store is very tired. I wish I could attach a pic of the wear. Send me a link to upload photos. | Not sure what the problem is but I can‚Äôt place an order on the Wendy‚Äôs App using my iPhone with T-mobile. | Difficult to login and when I can login the app is useless. Gets stuck on a screen that I can‚Äôt get out of. | Very hard to get through the app and very disappointing. | Everytime I put order in for delivery, it tells me payment couldn‚Äôt go through, check payment. I‚Äôve changed the card numbers, reentered card numbers, changed payment type and nothing works. There‚Äôs money in my accounts but it won‚Äôt go through. I even tried for pick up, still doesn‚Äôt work. I reached out to customer support, they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything. Got an email that says we will look into issue and that was it. App is pointless if you can order anything | The staff was of no help. Didn‚Äôt know about the current promotion of a $2 double. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go back! The person working the front counter was incompetent and said I was the reason people didn‚Äôt want to work fast food. I‚Äôve worked fast food and I knew how to help people, especially when it came to giving great customer service. She kept saying she didn‚Äôt know an answer and didn‚Äôt know how to help. My suggestion is they need additional training. | Put an order in and it said my order was placed.  App then wanted me to reorder so I went inside to the counter to verify.  Had to reorder.  Not sure yet if I was charged twice | Always getting the ‚ÄúOops, request failed, forbidden 403‚Äù

And there‚Äôs no way around it and app is either designed to not get you to customer service or everyone is constantly having the same issues

Terrible. | I mean I can't even use the app a large majority of the time since my request is forbidden almost every time I try and log in and it strongly discourages me from getting Wendys every single time it happens | Quick craving satisfied. Trying the orang frosty also!! | Was supposed to get a free coke with an order bait and switch | Love your March Madness deal üçî.",4.72705,797945,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/28/8b/72/288b7269-ca6e-d2bd-eabc-99fc593a4379/32e2e2e2-a91b-41c4-8379-f60eace837f0_1-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/df/13/fa/df13fa71-7b62-11df-c857-dd6fee697f32/5e2fd0b6-1868-46b3-afab-9dcdc35c4acc_2-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b8/e4/76/b8e4760a-eab4-0bb2-29ae-37007240a3f4/69ab6087-7ff6-4ff1-8fcc-e53beafb00cc_5-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/e6/51/ba/e651ba78-1ac6-4b53-4413-bea19be9c0fb/94e77e17-dd29-415b-8ac1-ab7c79eae2be_4-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/db/46/88/db4688e4-cd3a-c37f-4634-21dbecb013c8/63da38b4-96c0-4ac9-8c3a-6093de450a8f_1242x2208bb__1_.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/22/a2/73/22a273b1-b703-caad-51c0-47052bd266bd/1a437ec1-db08-4ad5-b360-e08a26d0c2b0_8-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/06/42/ce/0642cecd-31c2-469e-2c83-729113b1b8e2/c54d36d0-9c7b-46c9-ac44-b3ce084fe91d_1242x2208bb__2_.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/76/f3/fa/76f3fa82-d09a-1220-0c95-a6b83ff5c795/90e508f0-dd46-463f-b723-1eb5f6f2b3a2_6-1242x2208_Apple_5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Don‚Äôt ever waste your time searching for something specific to view or change because the simplest help search results in no relevant context regardless of how you reword it or dumb it down. Zero credibility there and of course you can click on the link saying it‚Äôs not relevant or helpful 1000 times but you can‚Äôt find a link or human being that can help. It‚Äôs gonna go and I‚Äôm going to try to get all my information to something more reliable than google. | Well Google almost has the answer to everything lol | No, I see google almost everywhere I don‚Äôt want to see it here. | Great | In your matter in your security I just been careful I know you are everywhere ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå | Logging in is difficult. | This app is so awesome üòé and it has to many websites to visit üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫üì∫ | Terrible | Works very well, and takes me anywhere I need to go, no complaints here | No, I do not want to sign in to my google account everywhere

Update: Google, quit being evil | Unable to access 3rd party keyboards. | User friendly search engine | No me because I would like some support so far I have not had any . I‚Äôm very angry that google has allowed a USB security key on all of my accounts I have told them time and time again I do not have a USB security key.

Chrome keeps up with all your bookmarks no matter what device you sign into Chrome on. Tabs are easy to manage, it is just a better browser. 

I feel like I have my own computer or phone no matter what device I‚Äôm on. Google open on chrome is like having the Internet at your fingertips! | Good | Chrome has been going downhill on my devices for a while now. Sometimes images just don‚Äôt load, the entire app freezes and I have to restart it, sometimes going back and forward in the browser don‚Äôt work correctly. Sometimes websites just don‚Äôt load, while they do on safari. It‚Äôs becoming a real hassle. | Thanks for the great job and your informative review of what you did. | Ads on mobile websites are too intrusive and distracting. Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google‚Äôs business model is advertising based. But you have to enforce good behavior in ads around the web because the experience is now like MySpace. | What is a search anymore but an opportunity for Google to get paid. Absolute trash, can‚Äôt wait until AI eats Google‚Äôs lunch. | ÊäñÈü≥ | It‚Äôs kinda really slow | Despite the app being a bit slow at times, the most detrimental thing to my user experience is that I will leave a tab open to return to, only to find it has rearranged itself somewhere within the other tabs. It makes it difficult to find the one I‚Äôm searching for, especially when I have 80+ tabs open. Please just leave them in chronological order!! | Haven‚Äôt been using it much so I can‚Äôt really give a rating on it | Total invasion of your privacy. Literally everything you do is collected and monetized. | I should be able to open more than 5 or 6 tabs before they all stop rendering and go blank, but I can‚Äôt. 

Google also seems to be making it harder to use the app, forcing you to spend more time looking for what you opened it up for. This is for the advertisers benefit to maximize googles ad revenue. The changes are not to make browsing faster or better for the users. | Instead of swiping to move between private mode and shared tabs, provide users with the option to choose whether swiping closes the page or switches between modes. | Do you have computer bugs or viruses? | For some reason Imgur doesn't work even in incognito mode. | Usually like chrome but putting this shortcuts bar on my home screen and not giving me an option to remove it going to cause me to delete the app and just use safari. I do not want this whatsoever. Please fix asap before I completely removed chrome | I have always loved google chrome but ever since I started the college search process I have many different college websites open, but I hate the fact that I can‚Äôt group these tabs on my phone. Wish this was an option for phone users | Browser opening normally during business hours yesterday June 7, 2023 for few hours just to be crushing after few hours of use by 5-6 PM EST and not Opening at all and Crushing on Start since MAY, 2023!

Vivian and Bryce.. have to do this and you know how you have a good relationship with the best way to do this is by having 2 siblings together with each other‚Äôs parents to blame. You know what you can be proud of? original idea is a lot more important but I have to agree with your statement that you should have the right idea of the time for 7th grades  inn school to get their own place firstborn, to learn more of what you do in your own time, too. You can also pay attention to your own personal time and space for that time to be spent learning to be more active in school and not being afraid to take on more responsibility in the world than your parents do and the fact that is still a big challenge for your future. And in your own life as well as the present time to be able to make sure you pay attention to the present past and future as your lil sister and brother are doing well as they have been through this whole time you know that I am so proud to be your mom and mommy, to learn more of the things you want to be able to teach them about. When we were on our way to the Wednesdays we had to leave the house to get to the houses. We didn‚Äôt have to do anything but we were in a lot more than we could handle and it took us about 2yrs to find a new understanding that we were in this mess that was really difficult to deal with at that time because of the way things had to change so quickly and we didn‚Äôt know how to do things at all but we were in this situation we were so much more than a bit more prepared for the time that we needed to be together so it took us and we didn‚Äôt really know what we needed until we had to do it. We just didn‚Äôt know when we had to be able to get the house back together and we didn‚Äôt have the space for a little while so we had to go back to our old place and put a new one on top of the 2 yrs later was not even thought we had to be apart from that time period we had Wednesdays.

Paul and Nancy Dango | I like chrome because it can really get stuff done. It‚Äôs not like Google or Google basically tells you how to do things chrome actually is like a key to being able to be more accessible to the web and look what you want up and it works good same as being they‚Äôre good, I think that they should put a wireless router in the towers for cell phones so everyone has Wi-Fi because we pay enough for the phones anyway we need Wi-Fi merged with mobile Internet just make it stronger.

 This review is an old one but the last few days (today is March 16,2024)Chrome has slowed down. It buffers a lot. Frequently it just shuts down and goes back to the homepage on my iPad.

- TJeTIGERBeats | 5 STAR | When I first played this game, it started hard, but when I got used to it, it was very hard, so I just tried my best to get used to it but until I saw this video on YouTube that there is a glitching way to make it easy like very, very very, very easy and you would like every single song correct and like all done and it‚Äôs easily kind of hard to do the glitching thing but a lot of parts are really easy so I demand you to do the thing but I don‚Äôt really remember but it‚Äôs really good and I also got this other game that is called Roblox it‚Äôs a really fun game like really fun and there is about 1000 apps in Roblox that you can play and some games are even scary like very very scary like catnap. He‚Äôs really scary and I just don‚Äôt like him or she whatever but there is a easy thing about beat pro whatever it‚Äôs called I don‚Äôt remember but anyways back to the game so I got some tax sis Texas, but not like mess like you I‚Äôm texting somebody that‚Äôs not what I mean. It‚Äôs like something that you have to do and you will get a reward and stuff I got one done and it was a really really useful, like every single game was so easy like even the hard one they become so so very very so very easy it‚Äôs very useful but let me know if you wanna talk more about Roblox but I‚Äôm gonna say it‚Äôs really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really very  fun and good I really love it it‚Äôs super funüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüíúüíúüíúüíú And Roblox even has Robux Robux is something that you can buy with and you can organize your character like mine has a halo some wings and its name is Is ummmü§îü§îü§îü§îI don‚Äôt know how to spell it, but you can also have friends they‚Äôre really fun to play with, so I demand to buy Roblox it‚Äôs a really really fun game. I love it so much so so so so much and there‚Äôs like 9 million people on there that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to me but there is actually a lot more less I don‚Äôt really know but it is fun I really fun so I knew to buy this two games, it‚Äôs really good and also be a gamer because I am a gamer two and I‚Äôm about to be a YouTuber but I know I‚Äôm sending this to everyone but I just want wanted to know that I‚Äôm about to be a YouTuber so they know a new YouTuber is coming just to let you know bye see ya‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è | i love it | When I first played this it made me smile :)))) | This app is really good because it tests you fastnesses | Me encanta las lecciones | Sooooooo amazing!!! | I like it but it just has so many adds to where that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre doing, is watching adds. 

This would be a great app if it did not glitch as much. | Like this game has so many adds like are you seriousüôÑand it makes you pay! literally all you‚Äôre paying for is to watch the ads like that‚Äôs not necessary so don‚Äôt download this game I do not recommend‚ò∫Ô∏è | Theres to many adds adds even pop up in a level and mess u up so I do notmrecamend this game the why I gave it a one ‚≠êÔ∏è | 5/5 | Great but TOO MANY ADS.üò≠ | Love making my own stuff and making and hearing my own music is amazing. Please share this and read it and I also have a question for you, so what do you think about like? Do you have a headquarters? If so, can I come because I would love to see here, and I would like to know a bunch of stuff. | Just too good music I love it now I don‚Äôt have to use instruments anymore yay
Congratulations I love it | It is so important | I can new beats and I can learn making beats you need to download this game asap as soon as possible | When I first started, I got an ad...and I've read a lot of the other reviews and they were talking a lot about the ads.It said""What do you think about the game so far?"" and then it says ""Thanks for the feedback!"" like they even change anything. I did not even have for 5 mins and I wanted to delete it. Usually one song to learn has ten lessons, and after each lesson there is an ad. So there is TEN ADS after each song. And there is A LOT of songs. I'm not trying to be rude and I know a lot of apps have an ad after ad after ad, and I want it to stop like a lot of people can't pay the subscription so they just deal with it, not me though. I RAGE when there are way to many ads so I want to delete it.This game though is really fun and very good when board but the amount of ads there are, just no. If the creater sees this, please get rid of the ads. It's just so annoying and I'm that type of person that just hates ads, so please make other people's day better and get rid of the ads. Yes I made this just bc of the ads, but for me there were not much lagging or anything else it's just the ads so I recommend taking some of the ads away.thank you for taking your time to whoever is reading this, if you agree great, if you don't great. Good morning, afternoon or night. Ÿ©(‡¥∞ÃÄ·¥ó‡¥∞ÃÅ)·µá ∏·µâüòâ | This game is the best because there is no ads and it‚Äôs free | It has a good verity of songs to beatbox to! | I just wanna stay on the game all day and night ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üß°üíõüíõüíöüíöüíôüíôüíúüíú.

I‚Äôve been on Duolingo for only 23 days, but man I LOVE THIS APP!!! | Good | I have been learning so much french and have been speaking fluently in just a week!!! I wish just wish I had more time on the timed challenges. | Doligi is a goodishd lingidj apa sot I gib 1 ster | This is one of the best apps to learn spanish | Absolutely beautiful in every way 
It is a dream come true haha | This is a amazing app to have if you are learning a new language! I am learning spanish currently.

There‚Äôs no phone number, and the emails I‚Äôve sent have not been responded to. 
We bought the plan on Feb. 10 and have have tried again and again to add family members, but the link does not work (they just bring me back to my (adult) account without adding any of my kids (who have their own Apple ID and passwords). I‚Äôm beyond frustrated. Then I found out they billed me $83.99 on Feb 10, and another $128.99 on Mach 2 (when we upgraded‚Ä¶.that was full price though, not an upgrade as promised when I clicked on it in the app). And of course there‚Äôs no recourse. I‚Äôve applied to Apple/Google for a refund. I‚Äôm so done with this company. Kids can use something else to learn languages.

Unfortunately for me, I invested 65,000 GBP worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 240,000 GBP within a couple of weeks. But i didn't realize i was dealing with a scam company, until i tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because i could not afford to let it go. So i tried all possible means to make sure i recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of ALPHATECHSPY @ gMail So i file a report and she was able to help me get back all my lost funds within 3hrs i feel indebted to her. Apart from trying to express my gratitude to them once again using this medium, I will recommend anvbod who wants to recover scammed bitcoin, stolen cryptocurrency, funds lost to binary options forex, investment and any other form of online scam, reach out to AlphaTechSpy (At) gMail | So i usually only use PayPal to pay artist but my tattoo appointments so i don‚Äôt really get a lot of daily use with my account but there has never been fraudulent activity on my account. Recently i was getting a refund from an artist from a cancelled appointment, as soon as i accepted my payment PayPal decided to limit my account. So i reached out to get it fixed sent them all the info they needed and they decided to completely shut my account down so the money that is on my account is now locked for 180 days Becuase they felt pretty much that i don‚Äôt use my account enough. They never gave me a specific answer to why they shut me out just was saying based on the guild lines you went against. And when i called they also were no help. So. Once i get my money back in AUGUST, I WILL NEVER BE USING PAYPAL AGAIN! | The interest on PayPal is pretty high overall good service security high | The app is impossible to navigate. The adds are mixed with your transaction information, pop ups with adds are triggered constantly. It gives a strong impression than the app UX is specifically designed to be as much frustrating as a possible. It makes me to wander if I can install an AdBlock on this app. 

UX designers if you are reading this. This is a perfect example how NOT to design a finance app.

The app gives me strong dystopian future vibes where mega corporations are stimulating hyper consumption on every level a human existence. | I‚Äôve always liked PayPal app and it‚Äôs UI for being easy except when it comes to managing your PayPal credit. 

It looks like it‚Äôs a built in web browser and difficult to navigate and make payments. I hope that improves in the near future. | App is very glitchy when I‚Äôm trying to send money won‚Äôt let me used card I already have saved on app | No matter what I did the app was stuck on face unlocking and never loading into the app. It‚Äôs completely unusable. Thankfully the website is still stable. | Paypal was my go to payment method on Pixiv Fanbox. But now they‚Äôre refusing to do business with Pixiv, a major website for artistic expression, drawing, and creation, over disagreements with adult and risque content! As a consumer this massively inconveniences people like myself and others, who have no problems morally or ethically with adult content! This refusal to serve as a payment processor on R-18 artists pages curtails their creative freedom, hurting independent artists trying to make a living, and has a disturbing chilling effect on our ability to embrace a freedom of artistic expression, as an international community! Please reverse this decision, a payment processor should not be weighing in on the ethics of certain forms of artistic expression enjoyed and created among a community of consenting adults! | Ever since I added Amex Send I cannot send using my bank! It just sits there and refuses to change source. Fix it, please. | Every time I log in and go to wallet the app crashes. And I also don‚Äôt see my card in the wallet. I see it being monitored but not populated in the list. I tried reinstalling updating same thing | They aren‚Äôt perfect but between PayPal & Cashapp in my opinion are the easiest systems for Managing your finances, considering you don‚Äôt have an actual bank and or credit union account. | Takes forever to load and it kicks you out when you click out of the app when you try to link your bank account | Pal Pal is an easy and convenient way to spend money safely and stays on top of problems as well. I highly recommend it for a way to manage money. | It wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating if after making a payment on either Pay in 4 or Monthly payment, that it actually updates. I can not tell what I have paid for already after making all payments.

Fees connected to purchases and sales. Just had enough hassles!!! Sticking with Venmo!! Extremely unhappy and frustrated. Most people aren‚Äôt using it anymore anyway. Was keeping for occasional people who were surprised I was still using, well won‚Äôt be anymore!!! | They took my money and won‚Äôt give it back | PayPal is good for paying via my phone, but it could be much better with only two adjustments.
1) I am transgender. *I would like to hide my legal name from the public.* Right now, there is no option to use my chosen name at all, even just as a display name. This makes me deeply uncomfortable and creates confusion in some transactions with people who don't know my legal name. This request is my top priority.
2) I would like an option to disable or hide the cryptocurrency tab. This is not a big issue, but the tab is simply intrusive to the way that I use PayPal. This could be easily fixed with a toggle in the settings. | Sad you made it so difficult to see credit balance on app! | I‚Äôve always loved PayPal but it just seems like it gets better every year! Love using it at express pay online, love that they do a savings account and I like it better than cash app to send money to people and receive money. | I thought it was free to send and receive money.

I really enjoying the 4 payment option and 6 months pay - no interest. Really supportive for the financial needs.

I hope they change this! | This is the worst app ever. Closes accounts for no reason at all and does not refund your money back. Absolutely ridiculous!! I‚Äôm sticking to Cashapp. Worst app to download. | Bien e casi todos los aspectos, pero se demoran en procesar los pagos, ya hace una semana que pague la tarjeta y no se actualiza el saldo disponible y se me a cobrado | The best reasons for using PayPal is restricting the sharing of my credit card to one trusted party. It‚Äôs also very convenient in that it allows me to make purchases without having to enter credit card info.  Simple | The app is so simple to use and navigate around! It‚Äôs easy to use with purchases as well! | What‚Äôs up with PayPal credit,after being a account holder for a year and above 18  should be approved for account | I absolutely love this app. It is convenient to use when making purchases and I don‚Äôt have to worry about anyone scamming me. If I have a problem with a purchase, I can call PayPal and they will handle it for me without any problem and I‚Äôm able to keep my payments made on time due to the payment is due around the time I get paid at the end of the month. | I don't like PayPal, why do they manage your money at their convenience, if they want they will hold it for up to 20 days, for no reason | Someone else spent over $400 on my account and they did nothing to help me. I am only getting $200 back because I contacted the company the products were purchased from and they were able to do more. PayPal‚Äôs customer service members all give you different answers and nothing is correct or helpful. | PayPal makes my life easier. I like being able to make payments without giving away all of my personal information. | So, I downloaded the app, I registered my card and everything was working well. Recently my bank gave me a new card so I decided to add and register the new card in PayPal, except the app wouldn‚Äôt let me change the card so I tried getting help on the app. I had to provide a couple of things in order to get my account back to activated. I had no problem with the other card, but this one was apparently giving the app problems but I find it weird cuz it was brand new and I hadn‚Äôt used it. I provided the information needed but they still deactivated my account for no reason. I didn‚Äôt make a transaction with the app or my card but they still deactivated my account. Idk what to do since they have my information and I tried to close my account and they won‚Äôt let me. Don‚Äôt know if this app is a scam or something though. | Once again / log into Paypal on iPhone - all updates completed- log into ship station and the gear just spins and doesn‚Äôt go to ship screen

Great, vintage models of every type are available at (fairly) reasonable prices.‚Ä¶And they don‚Äôt take forever to deliver! 
Thanks again , and you‚Äôll definitely be hearing from this 70 year old kid again soon!üòé | Mil gracias ! Mi pedido lleg√≥ en perfecto estado y a tiempo | Amazing quality, fits well, the only thing is it took a while to arrive. | Thank Y‚Äôall for the fast shipping ü§ûüèΩ | This part will not fit my string trimmer. | Thank you | Zero issues, stress free experience! | Nearly two weeks to get my order and I got it broken. | FedEx had trouble delivering the package and Gld was quick in responding when I contacted their email. | Love it | I‚Äôm going on a cruise and Level 8 Voyager was recommended. The wide handle really helps me to navigate it with ease. The premium wheels make it slide along effortlessly and rolls like butter! I‚Äôm so happy I purchased my two piece set and look for to many years of enjoyment! I highly recommend. | This was an amazing experience I was a little hesitant but the end result was great thank you I recommend them to everyone. I‚Äôll will definitely be buying again from here | I just wanted an estimate on when a package from a vendor that uses this storefront would arrive. No website, you it says you *have* to download the app to get updates. But that isn‚Äôt true; they don‚Äôt offer tracking info or delivery estimates. Best they‚Äôll do is tell you what shipping method was used. Seriously this is so stupid. | I like to know when my purchases will arrive! | The Shop app worked excellent. they tracked my order the whole time and told me the exact precise time that it was delivered. However, I will never order from gld.com again. It took them over seven days to give me my order. When they told me it would be here in three. | These are very comfortable and well made shirts but they shrink. They were to small for us after first washing. üòí | I am 53. Yes I fell for the hype of social media with these. Shame on me. These were all sugar and none of the sleeping aid. I took 2 as directed 30 min before bedtime. They did nothing. I was up as usual. When will celebrities really mKe  good product??? These also took forever to receive and they are way too much money for what they contain. I can‚Äôt wait to make a TikTok of my honest review!!! Oh and I kindly asked for a refund but have heard nothing !!!!!! | Don‚Äôt ever sign up with them using your phone number because it‚Äôs about the biggest hassle ever to change it if you ever get a new phone. Changed my number on the app and thought I was done, tried to order something yesterday and what do you know, I need to call and talk to an actual person, so I did that, nope they still can‚Äôt do it. So now I have to wait for them to ‚Äúescalate it‚Äù to someone else because apparently even though I can verify every single bit of my info that‚Äôs not enough. Don‚Äôt waste your time | The app works as described with no issues. Great that it tracks your packages! | Updates on my packages were constant every time a change was made and also gave me good information on the entire order. Love that I'm able to shop from other stores on here too. | Keep up the good work the end | Love the shop app- it‚Äôs honestly so reliable | Tus Small Bag | Not easy to use with a Mac and not good support from customer service. | I've had orders that have not been delivered that were marked as they had been. I get no reply when I address this concern.  My bank is currently working on one dispute.  
Two sets of pots and pans were never delivered.
Also, half of a toothbrush order was not ordered. | My daughter and I bought these for each other for Xmas, the ones with names. I got my daughter gold with black writing and she got me gold with colored writing‚Ä¶ they are both chipping and it seems there is pink under the gold????? | If you order something they charge you a fee but did not support the follow up. You have to call the vendor . If you chat you will chat wit a AI . | The delivery was on time maybe even ahead of expectations and delivered right to my front door which is not an easy task in this development as it‚Äôs secured. The driver went the extra effort to get it to my door. Thank you! | I haven‚Äôt used it yet hope everything working right, my box was turned upside down so I hope everything good | Love love this app! Can‚Äôt get enough of using it online @ my favorite stores! <3 | Shirt was damaged and lost my package and had to get it reshipped. | It would be a great app, but it has trouble connecting to amazon account and tracking amazon orders. It did work fine before, but now it became useless with amazon. | I love this makeup set, so easy to apply no caking and hides small lines | Received my hat today,very please with the fit,however the dobbs hat pin was not with this hat is there pin that comes with it‚Ä¶.. | I ordered 2 blouses , They're  pretty but they run way to small I ordered my size XL very disappointed! | Excellent produit | Never got my order!  Confiscated by post office because of postage issue and store won‚Äôt respond. | I bought some sneakers with this app, after purchasing them the page disappeared and has not been updated until now. I try to communicate with the app or have them help me find out what happened and I can't. It only has frequently asked questions. I trusted this app and they scammed me. I demand an answer | Constantly disconnect from Amazon. And when you try to sign back in the app freezes. Otherwise it‚Äôs a very useful app. | I ordered three bottles and it took 4 days for them to get here which isn‚Äôt bad at all. | Currently looking for my package in case it‚Äôs at a different adress nearby. Very upset | Good job ‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank You | I got this for my girlfriend and she rubs all over it and then she gives me big kiss | Great quality came fast. Works well fit well also | I used to love this app, I had all of my orders in one location to track. Recently, I‚Äôve noticed plenty of orders being tracked that weren‚Äôt mine. I don‚Äôt order as much online as I used to, so I barely have anything to track. Yet when I would get on the app it showed me about 6-10 orders all being sent to different locations. I didn‚Äôt pay any mind to it a few months back as I was wondering if it was just a glitch. Then recently I went on again and yet again it showed me the same thing. It makes me wonder if my information is being shared. I decided to do what‚Äôs best and just delete my account. I‚Äôll track my orders the old school way, through my emails. Hopefully they fix this odd issue and maybe I‚Äôll create an account again. | Absolutely luxurious and fits to perfection. | Downloaded the app and have notifications on but it doesn‚Äôt notify me of anything of my orders. | I love the Tribal chain it is worth the money that I paid. | I am so impressed with my February budget box!

Also I don‚Äôt like the new art. It‚Äôs good just I like the old one so much more better. Love y‚Äôall but please change it back. -Me | Can you please fix it so not every episode runs though the entire ending credits and then it takes another 20 seconds to play the next episode?  My 2 year old is losing his mind over it and if he is we are all üòµ‚Äçüí´ | This app is overall pretty good. It could be better but would recommend | I like the way it has Hulu it is just the best. Thanks for this. | I love marvel | Man was so fun it had extreme music and so much more | I love this app | New icon is hideous compared to previous version, and the price has doubled in just a few years. 

Cancelled sub and deleted. | Has great stuff | Disney is a shell of the glorious company it once was, when it supported the Judeo-Christian family values on which it was build and this great country was founded.  It is now shameless in its indoctrination of children, who should be left to grow and enjoy their childhood as precious boys and girls .. and NOT be exploited for profit üí∞ by Disney‚Äôs abhorrent social engineering agenda. | So it‚Äôs a great movie and tv watching platform but‚Ä¶. It has some real inappropriate stuff that they put under pg. I just can‚Äôt believe it. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt get your kids hooked on the Disney + things. I watched the Disney channel things as a kid so I watched it all the time. It just exposed me to things I shouldn‚Äôt have seen.

It constantly keeps logging me and my friends out of the account, even though we haven‚Äôt reached the device count. We keep having to reset the password just to access our account every what, every week? Everything is paid for. There aren‚Äôt that many logged in devices, so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. What‚Äôs also funny, is that hulu started doing the same thing. And we SURELY didn‚Äôt reach the device count on that one. Fix your stupid app, because at this point it‚Äôs wasting my money. | I am so glad you made this video 
Love s | Very asthetic | I love these movies | I love the Marvel series | The Disney+ subscription does not disappoint! All of my favorites are in one app! I love that I can start watching at home on my tv and finish on my phone or tablet when I‚Äôm away! Highly recommend! | The app always crashes and resets back to the Home Screen on the tv app. | Very good programming | I like Disney+ but sometimes when I am a not at home or sitting in my car my wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt work for Disney+ for some reason but other then that I like watching Disney+ so yeah 

Bye have a good day | This is such a great app to watch! Disney+ is so amazing because my family and I always watch something all together. I love how it gives you so many movies and tv shows to watch! My little sister LOVES this app as well!As soon as I come home from work I go and watch something on Disney+. So my point is that I LOVE Disney+!!! | I love Disney+ because you can watch you favorite actor like liv and mAddie | It glitches all the time. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs because we have an ad supported account. | Disney has all you can think of and there‚Äôs kid mode for inappropriate things you don‚Äôt want your kid watching | I love this new goosebumps ü©µ | Disney supports in some form institutions that suppress the human rights of some of the most disenfranchised humans on the planet. They should be boycotted as consequence | I dont like Taylor Swift cuz shes bad | The content is great, but it crashes a lot. There are also some ghost buttons while watching. However, this is a great app, and waaaaaaay better than Disneynow. EDIT I‚Äôm sorry, I had to change my review. It was 4 stars, but the Eras Tour made it 5. You have done a great thing for us Swifties! Thank you! YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! Real rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Edit 2:

If you don‚Äôt want the ads, just pay. Calm down. Welcome to capitalist America. | It is cool with the greenish blue and the Taylor swift concert is awesome I didn‚Äôt know that you like Taylor swift | It‚Äôs oh k but it could be better | Awesome | MAKE MORE X-MEN ‚Äò 97 EPISODES | Its ok app but doesn‚Äôt have enough content. Waste of your money!!! | I was just to lazy to write a cringey story so I just gonna recommend this, also ‡∂û | I would feel bad about writing this but I‚Äôm not and because have grown sick of the ads every two seconds it‚Äôs ads all over the place and when I rewind on episodes I have to rewatch the ad all over again and even when I watch stuff on my phone I can still do other things and still watch the ads but the second I try to go back into Disney plus it restarts me and I have to watch the ads all over again i would sadly you need to do better but I know this is probably going to get deleted anyway | Disney is the greatest!! | Bad content‚Ä¶ most of the time. Ruined Star Wars, ruined marvel and ruined Mickey Mouse. | anyway so ,WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE LOGO THE BRIGHT TEAL COLOR DOSE NOT SUIT IT ,LIKE BELIEVE ME ,ITS NOT ROCKING IT 
, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR ORDERED 5 DOLLARS TO REDECORATE IT, PLS TRY HARDER, I REALLY LIKE HOW THE OCEAN ONE LIKE NUMBER ONE RANKING THE OG ONE IS THE BEST, PERIOD, AND ONE LAST THING IF YOUR GONNA CHANGE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE DONT EVER USE BRIGHT COLORS. AND THAT IS A PERIOD AGAIN. | No option to remove shows from Continue Watching? Automatic 1-star. It‚Äôs 2024. Get with it. Random shows get added to my Continue Watching, shows I‚Äôd never watch and I can‚Äôt even remove them. | This is absolutely the most amazing streaming experience you CAN HAVE!!!!!
ü§©ü§©ü§© there is  even prenatal guidance for parents who don‚Äôt want their kids to be watching things that they don‚Äôt know. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!! üòùüòùüòù | Nice sows and good stories cute stories | It‚Äôs slow and lagging again. I wasted my money on a subscription again thinking it was fixed. | I deleted YouTube And this is a great replacement for it | That I have to pay for an app that has ads everywhere. Just dumb. Cancels after free trial bc there really isn‚Äôt enough here to make it worthy | Love this app for the next update can you please add the show Cory in the house I would really appreciate it thank you | Save us all vote your shares with Nelson Peltz. | Disney is very good with no ads and I like that | Disney+ does have some good things but has many many many problems to work out and annoying one for me is there ability not to be able to remove something from the content you watch in or to remove a show from Disney+

However the website does. It will display an error message telling me to enter an email address and password and even when it‚Äôs right there in bold black text, it still tells me the same message. üòí [Update] They updated the app and it STILL won‚Äôt let me sign in via the app but their website is just going to have to be my go to for awhile. | App did not allow me to redeem my rewards.  I now have 5 free pizzas to redeem and can‚Äôt because no phone number for the phone  is available and the stupid app wouldn‚Äôt accept my password then it did accept it but then wouldn‚Äôt let me redeem the rewards.  I hate your app!  Also cannot give tip for driver on the app.  Who has $ anymore? | Good Job on new release! | The app is easy to navigate and works well. I cannot see any reason why I can‚Äôt tip my driver in the app though. Make it another order option. Done‚Ä¶ really frustrating to have to go get cash to order online‚Ä¶ Jesus. 

On top of that, why make a contact delivery option when it can never be if I have to tip the guy..
Dumb‚Ä¶.. | The app has merit, its almost there. But at times it is slow to respond, slow to update, say if you want to add a different card to pay, it will sit there for a few minutes and time out. | My app is fully updated and for months I have not been able to log in. | Every time we try to use the app it says local coupons cannot be loaded. Then it says delivery is not available to our address, even though it is.  We have to sign out, then back in, then delete our address and re-enter it, sometimes twice and three times before it works. We have to do this every time to make the app finally work‚Ä¶ very inconvenient, so we just had someone stop by Little Cesar‚Äôs on their way home for hot and ready this time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. | If I don‚Äôt use the app you always log me out and the password reset doesn‚Äôt work well and I have no idea what it is the next time I have to log in.  I got Face ID on the phone just keep me logged in. | Always logs me out of app when i go to use it. Inconvenient | Easy enough to order food, but the app keeps re-enabling marketing notifications, no matter how many times I turn them off. I‚Äôve had to fully disable notifications for the app in iOS Settings. | Not as user friendly as I‚Äôd hoped. I had to re-type multiple times, it couldn‚Äôt scan my card and didn‚Äôt save my address after the first submission‚Ä¶ operator error could have been in effect, but not over and over. It did get all my info and I did order a pizza, so it does work! | That $6.99 delivery fee kills the tip for your drivers. You are already making money dont be greedy. | Dominoes uses too much Garlic in everything! | It‚Äôs unfortunate I have to choose your competitor over your brand due to the hotel where I‚Äôm staying is too close to the location, .5 a quarter of a mile. Yakima, WA. | Just use the website or don‚Äôt order at all | I can‚Äôt use gift cards on the iPhone app because the Captcha does not launch. | I was given a messed up order so I complained that it‚Äôs was inappropriate for them to serve food like that ,it looked like they pick it up from the floor and it‚Äôs was burnt too so I threw it out so I get a email saying that I will get a gift certificate and said two weeks  well it‚Äôs been over a month no gift certificate . | The glitch whenever you face or finger ID is not letting you login it says please change your password and your email which I already did that three times and there‚Äôs no changes. Bug need fix. | We absolutely love your pizzas, especially the hand tossed and the pan, tho we would like to be able to get the pan Pizza in a large.  We also would like to be able to get (roasted) GREEN CHILIES in place of the green bell peppers.

My problem with the app is that it won‚Äôt let me see the LOCAL coupons without signing in (which I do as soon as I opened the app) and it usually takes 2 or 3 attempts before I get re-signed in. 

Hope this can get straightened out soon. | I‚Äôm not sure why but the app is so much worse than it use to be. I get error messages constantly. I‚Äôve tried it on several different devices and it still does it every time. Very frustrating. | The whole app doesn‚Äôt even load up lol | It is extremely hard to navigate through screens. 

Need to add option to pay tip for person delivering order. | Please add a place to add the tip for your drivers. | I love this app, it i so easy to order and the pizza is always great. | i downloaded the app and enabled alexa with my order it‚Äôs been so convenient giving me real time updates i love dominos! üçï | I did 3 password resets. Unable to login to the app everytime. 

Update: Issue resolved | NO PLACE TO LEAVE A TIP FOR THE DRIVER!!!!!!!!!   This is definitely not a positive for the app! | App won‚Äôt let me order on my iPad keeps saying not enough space | This is the best pizza app hands down, it‚Äôs not even a friggin competition y‚Äôall cmon now. | Where is my free pizza? | I have turned off marketing push notifications in the app, and still I receive so many marketing messages. Now I have to turn off all notifications, since you abuse the push notifications | The customer service experience is almost nonexistent. It‚Äôs impossible to get anyone to respond to email tickets and they utilize a chat bot. | BEST DOMINOS EVER‚ÄºÔ∏èüíØ | Gift Card bot check is not working again‚Ä¶blank screen | I usually use the iPhone app and and I‚Äôm pretty used to how it looks and feels. Now that I‚Äôve got an iPad this app is quite a bit better allows you to visualize your order a lot easier and makes placing orders for certain things a lot faster. | We Oder Dominoes at Least 3 times a week exact same offer every single time and when I  allied and spoke to Michelle in Glendora to me she couldn‚Äôt help me.  Even if I made a mistake a very loyal customer should at least get some type of discount.  Very disappointed ü•≤ | I have to change my password EVERY order. I love Domino‚Äôs, HATE the app. | This app is always singing you out, every time I use it crashes when I'm trying to go to the checkout. Or when I first login in always something fails Jesus. They need to hire new devs, I like dominos but their app is horrendous | I would order a lot more often if this app just worked better. I do not want to have to log back in so often. With the amount of ‚Äútechnical errors‚Äù I receive, I am usually forced to give up. Often the errors appear right at check out, and I can‚Äôt get the order to go through. When I try to reset my password, and then I‚Äôm unable to long back in due to an error, how do you expect me to use the app? My limited time coupons go wasted. | Bang.  This app delivers exactly which Pizza I want right to my doorstep.  Never any issues.  QUICK delivery time. 10/10 | The app got an update and i‚Äôm unable to login since.  Login to web site by browser works.   
***Solved the issue by deleting app, cursing loudly the programmers, and login after reinstalling.  
QA is a joke. rating base on app QA, Dominos is a 5. 

The Pizza is very good. | Notification settings won't save on change | It never remembers my password and then won‚Äôt let me change it.now it won‚Äôt send it | App didn‚Äôt work. Nothing was working, couldn‚Äôt sign in online. I changed the password 3 times. So I downloaded the app. The app wouldn‚Äôt work. App stated my account did not exist. I have ordered pizza in many different states for many years with the same account. Tried to create an account then. App stated account already exists. I tried signing in on the browser again and it finally worked. It took over an hour to order a pizza online. I don‚Äôt understand what the malfunction was. I literally spent over an hour trying to order food. | The app is having technical issues. I‚Äôve used 2 phones so far and I entered a email and a password and it kept stating I didn‚Äôt enter a password or email, yet I did. | App does not work at the most pertinent times. | I have app on my mobile device and I have created the profile, sometime it allowed me to sign in but many time gives network error. I tried with resetting password but still the mobile app has issue for sign in. 
It allow me to order pizza without sign in but don‚Äôt allow to sign in. Whenever signed it order something next time it again thrown me out from app.
The app has many issue, worst app I ever used, | I earned a free pizza and can‚Äôt eat it bc it doesn‚Äôt let me log in. And the password reset link doesn‚Äôt even let me change the password.

You can literally specify what you are looking for and it will still pull up jobs that you are not what you are looking for | I‚Äôve tried using this app for a few years now and have never had any luck getting a job thru this app | Scam jobs
No response from any companies 
Same jobs reposted over long periods of time
Claims of urgently hiring but no one reaches out | Great working with indeed. | So sick of wasting time on jobs with no salary | This app is Awesome!!! It really helped me find a good job‚Ä¶ | I don‚Äôt have time to deal with an app that keeps logging me out. I‚Äôm done. Deleted | Atleast for myself, the app did not work at all. Blank & unresponsive. | Awesome App & Easy to use .Its Good | Over the years, I‚Äôve tried Indeed for job hunting, and in all that time, I‚Äôve never once had a serious response from any companies. I‚Äôve submitted literally hundreds of applications, have a bachelors degree and over a decade of work experience in useful fields, but the only responses I‚Äôve ever received were from companies trying to scam new hires. Truly a disappointing app that offers no real value, only false hope. | This app only uses date (DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP) | Easy to use | I‚Äôve had this app for years and have never found a job through this app
You‚Äôre better off going out to actually look for a job | Work People never reply | I don‚Äôt get notifications on indeed for job for some reason | They don‚Äôt send your resume to the jobs they sell your data waste of time :) | Especially cause it‚Äôs  the immediate needs for employers. And the businesses that post, are really great at quickly responding to applicants. | When I click on certain jobs, it says bad gateway and will not let me continue. I have updated the app with every update, and it still will not let me access certain links. | You can find the job you needs, great opportunities. | As one of the few job search apps that companies actually use, Indeed is surprisingly disorganized.
In theory, Indeed is a great app. It has a simple search function, suggests jobs for you, and has options to see what other employees think about jobs. However, the job listings are overwhelmingly tagged incorrectly.
I cannot count how many times I have searched for entry level jobs and been shown jobs that require degrees and years of experience. This issue is not unique to me: I have discussed this with many other people in person and online and found that we have the same problem.
The solution to this would be to moderate job listings and require proper tagging, as well as to have a function where users can report incorrectly tagged jobs. | Yea we suggest you apply for a job just to get the numbers up. Then we also have jobs that it is easier to apply for a home loan than this job. | I‚Äôm tired of trying to apply to jobs and get a bad link error. With every job? It‚Äôs ridiculous fix it! | Amazing app for finding job opportunities and for people looking for workers alike! | Good app | Not sure why people are leaving such grand reviews. The app is junk. Once I set my profile parameters, they should remain. Instead it changes every time I log in. Recommended jobs are WAY OUTSIDE the range set for distance and type. | Constant Bad Message 431 errors when doing job searches make the app unusable. | The worst app ever this is certainly a scam an hasn‚Äôt helped anyone in the uk | I have downloaded this app 3 different times, and it always glitches. It won‚Äôt let you perform certain functions, like ‚ÄúApply Now.‚Äù | It‚Äôs a solid app, and Indeed is about the best job search out there. The app has all the functionality of the website but better design, especially on iPad. Yet I STILL have to use the web version because the bright white app screen is just too much before sunrise and at night. | In my personal opinion, I‚Äôm not sure if indeed works I haven‚Äôt gotten any callbacks. Had a professional look over my r√©sum√©, and said everything looked great. Just very unsure on what the next steps are and disappointed looking for a job on indeed. | Fired From Members | I like the personal touch of Indeed who encouraged me to set my sights higher. | Lost a job without warning and spent a month applying to over three hundred jobs with a bachelors degree and the only company to contact me was Amazon for a entry level seasonal job. Either Indeed is not sending the applications like they are supposed to or the posted jobs are fake but it‚Äôs all a waste of your time. | Ready helpful and easy to used | I don‚Äôt know how many times you can repeatedly send feedback to this company, they continuously ask for it and do nothing with that information. While at the same time showing the same jobs over and over even when you hit not interested and update your preferences. Not to mention when you keep seeing the ‚Äúyou maybe missing qualifications‚Äù message, like if it‚Äôs not on my resume clearly I don‚Äôt have that qualification. Like I‚Äôm not a nurse why show me 500 nursing and doctor jobs? This app use to make sense. | Amazing!!! Helped me so much now I am able to presume my careerüëç | i got a job by an alcoholic that belittled me everyday payed me next to nothing & when i reported it no one got back to me. the good jobs i applied for never reached out. have yet to had any useful jobs come from this. | Everytime I apply for a job no one ever gets back with me like EVER this app is useless!!!! | Don‚Äôt wasted your time with this app. It‚Äôs a complete scam, people are putting up fake jobs then these employers have more control over the people now. Stop applying on this fake app | Notification driven and no results. I don‚Äôt know how many times I have had ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù from different companies reach out and say they saw my resume on indeed and feel i would be a good fit. You apply and then hear nothing back from them. 
Scam.
I had one company finally respond and they asked a good time to do a phone interview before having me come in for a sit down interview.
I gave them a time and day and listen my phone number.
They confirmed the date and time and then asked for my phone number. 
It felt robot like responses and the company never called. 
Don‚Äôt waste your time with indeed and creating a profile. You will get nothing but constant notifications in your email of ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù saying they saw your resume and think you would be a good fit and to apply. Then you will get zero response from them.
Also, they will list a city location where they are and then you research more outside indeed and the company isn‚Äôt within 25 miles of you, but 100 miles or something ridiculous like that. | I‚Äôve gotten more job opportunities on here than any other app | When I try clicking on a job, an error says Bad Message 431. All the years I‚Äôve been using indeed, this has never ever happened. | No longer interested in using indeed due to the lbgt adds. #boycott | This app is awful there are so many fake jobs posted and scammers on this it‚Äôs very hard to navigate finding a job, that the last thing you need when trying to seek employment is being scammed. This app is definitely not worth it, and they need to regulate posts better. | Too many spam/scam job postings!! | Super easy to use, and makes the job search just that much more accessible | I keep getting the following message from most jobs I‚Äôm trying to apply for 
Bad Message 431

reason: Request Header Fields Too Large | 1. Because ""ABC Co"" is listed on my resume, I am considered the expert on it(!) and at the bottom of my screen I am asked questonable such as ""Is ABC Co"" showing employees to work from home during Covid?"" and ""Does ABC Co pay fairly?"" etc. In one case I left the company more than 5 years ago and have no knowledge of what they are doing now; in the other, I worked for a single individual who is now deceased and it is painful to see this pop up. There is no way to get rid of these questions without putting in an answer out of frustration - which may not be correct. Very frustrating. 2. I would like to be able to filter out certain industries in my profile so they do not appear in any of my searches. I have no medical background but get listings for nurses, doctors, etc. This does to multiple fields. 3. Along with #2, you can indicate you are not interested in a job üö´ and select the reason, but similar jobs keep popping up. 4. It would be good if a job were automatically moved to ""applied"" once you complete the application. You have to do this yourself and I have come close to applying for the same job twice. And 5. I understand that apps might look different and perform differently under different browsers - but my searches don't sync! I've got different combinations on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook.

And even though it‚Äôs my first order on the account ever I can‚Äôt get a refund. | Employees are instructed to ignore complaints/issues with orders. You‚Äôre much better off with Door Dash, they are the best and have better restaurant options too! | The only reason I gave this app a 5 is so people can see. When I orders from this app so many problems happen. Earlier today I order a meal for $50 just to get an order that cost 13 dollars. I went to support to see if I can get a refund or if they can resend me my order. They said that I can‚Äôt refund it and i don‚Äôt know why. This has happened multiple times when I‚Äôm missing an order and they won‚Äôt refund me or resend it. This app is horrible please just stick to door dash. They will never be receiving money from me ever again. THIS APP IS HORRIBLE IT WILL JUST TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GO!!!!! | i‚Äôve been using uber eats for YEARS with no problems. i recently tried to place an order and had a message pop up on my phone saying ‚Äúplease try a different payment method‚Äù which confused me because i know there‚Äôs money in my acc. i went to my bank acc and it showed uber STILL took the money out of my acc even though it said i needed to try a different payment method. so i contacted customer service and this lady named Vicky had me trying different troubleshooting methods to see if that would fix the ‚Äúauthorization hold‚Äù. she then told me to try to place my order again so i did. once again, i got the same ‚Äúplease try a different payment method‚Äù message. but it didn‚Äôt take any money out this time. after i told vicky it happened again, she placed me on hold for about 10 minutes. when she came back, all she could tell me was ‚Äúwe‚Äôve reviewed your issue and unfortunately we cannot help you with your payment method restriction.‚Äù I spent all that time trying ways to fix my account just for that? i‚Äôm never using this app again. | Frequent and long delivery delays resulting in poor quality food. Customer service is worthless, they will tell you repeatedly they can‚Äôt do anything for you to make the problem right. Had extra items not included with my order that were also not refunded. Stay away from this service. | Use favor they honor the orders. Uber eats is the Worst company with The Worst customer service. If Your food comes out wrong, missing item, and they still won‚Äôt refund you nor will they cancel your order if you asked them to. I called after literally seconds after placing an order and they refused to cancel it. They told me to contact the restaurant. The restaurant told me to contact them. It‚Äôs absolute trash. They‚Äôre rude and hung up on me. I asked them to cancel my membership and told me to use the app. It is literally the worst company I‚Äôve ever ever experienced. I wouldn‚Äôt use them. I would use Favor. | Poor service and it never comes on time and sometimes doesn‚Äôt even come at all and if I cancel it order they won‚Äôt give u ur money back don‚Äôt order here it‚Äôs a waste of yall time and if people are struggling they don‚Äôt care they won‚Äôt give u ur money back and plus it‚Äôs so expensive and they MAKE u give them a big tip sometimes and they‚Äôre drivers are rude don‚Äôt order here | Deleted the app, they are the worst! Charged me for my food which I waited over an hour for. I called the restaurant only for them to tell me they thought Uber canceled the order. I tried to update my phone number in the settings from a US to UK number since I moved countries only to have them lock me out of my account. Don‚Äôt lose your money and time using this app like I did. | Whether you are an Uber One user or not, the app will make your ‚Äúexpected delivery‚Äù deadline 2 hours later than you ordered it. They will take your money and screw you because they can‚Äôt find delivery drivers to make deliveries because they pay so little. Avoid this app at all costs. Absolute joke. Find another delivery app if you need to. | Got $5 back on order than you so much. I‚Äôd rather give you 20$ then have this happend again. Scam app | this app is garbage mama it‚Äôs TERRIBLE and they don‚Äôt refund you even when items or even the whole order isn‚Äôt delivered. USE ANY OTHER APP!! THIS APP IS GARBAGE!!!!!!! | The competition between food shipping companies is so many that Uber does not realize that it is the most expensive and the service is terrible apart from the fact that its drivers are not friendly and they always ask for a tip and apart from that they get angry because one does not give them a tip according to them adequate I hope Uber will fix this | This is so trash my Oder never came I had to pick it up this is the second time | They‚Äôre always late now and charging for frequently ordered places.

I went from orders being free with Uber one so now they‚Äôre not even a part of Uber one and charging $2.99 or even $4.99 for them. Why the change after I started ordering from them more frequently?

The orders are now late. They removed the benefit of $5 for late orders.

To get a free order you have to do a $15 MIN now.

 It‚Äôs not even worth it anymore. | Tried to create teen account. Every time my daughter tries to order, ‚Äúpayment fails‚Äù. Fine, tried her card. Ah, but apparently family members cannot have their own cards. OK, removed family member, tried to add it back. Now invite fails on teen‚Äôs phone with ‚Äúcheck your payment type‚Äù. What payment type? Didnt you just say family members must use family payment? Who wrote this??? | THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO FILTER OUT RESTAURANTS THAT ARE CLOSED OR UNAVAILABLE | I recently placed an order and I had an entire item missing. I reported the missing item immediately and I received a response from Anshika stating that I was not eligible for a refund. I explained multiple times that I did not receive the item. Anshika responded again that I was not eligible. I requested to have this reviewed and escalated and Anshika repeated that I had reached the highest level and could not escalate further. I tried finding a phone number or email to report this and could not locate it anywhere in the app. This is a huge dissatisfier and I am contemplating cancelling my membership if this is how these situations are handled. | There seems to be a bug where the coupons only work for one restaurant or store. That didn‚Äôt used to be the case and according to Reddit others seem to be experiencing the same issue. Seeing as this service is wildly overpriced even with coupons there really isn‚Äôt an incentive to using it if you can only order dominos. Customer support is no help so hopefully the developers can patch the app. | Got my card flagged because of a refund not at all | Terrible I received 3 of 5 items wrong and had several missing items and they made me pay the full order and wouldn‚Äôt offer a refund even though I didn‚Äôt get half of my order I‚Äôll never use this app again | Use DoorDash, GrubHub, etc. Awful customer service. | Delivery person didn‚Äôt even knock on door. 
Uber took my order from a Wendy‚Äôs that is much farther away than one close to me, consequently my food was cold. Nothing like a cold bacon burger! Have ordered from Uber Eats several times before but this was the first time in the free trial subscription. Shame on you ! | I received an email saying I could get $25 dollars off a purchase. I set up and order around 4:20pm and didn‚Äôt receive my food until past 5:30pm. I could picked up my order, finished my meal and saved some money on tax and tip. The food was not hot. Only positive was the total cost. Overall, did not enjoy waiting and will not be using this app again. | What is wrong with yall getting the orders on time yall need to give me some credit or some money back ever time I turn around my orders are always delayed and I am getting tired off this with yall | Their customer service is really bad. Don‚Äôt even use this app at all. Stay away to save money. | I‚Äôm only giving one star because I have to in order to leave this review. I have had several issues with missing items or missing orders in the past. Last night was my final straw. I ordered $26 worth of food. The picture sent by the driver was NOT my house. I called him and he answered, replied ‚Äúoh lemme check‚Äù then hung up on me. I called him back four more times for him to not answer. I tried to get a refund as my food was NEVER DELIVERED TO MY HOME, and was told it is ‚Äúineligible‚Äù. Customer service is unable to give me an explanation after hanging up on me twice btw, and states I can‚Äôt get a refund. So now I‚Äôm out $26 with no food. How is this legal???? DONT USE THIS APP. UBER EATS ARE SCAMMERS! | The taxes and fees are crazy expensive which make it so expensive I‚Äôd rather go and pick it up myself | Constantly missing items from orders. Doesn‚Äôt matter which restaurant, time of day, or day of the week. Makes the entire service unusable. Avoid! | Expensive
Unreliable 
Poorly made
We all know this and use it anyway. Deeply shameful every time I use the app | Terrible service all the time ! | THIS APP IS A DISASTER WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I KNEW IT WOULD HELP . I see people here saying the only way to get the review scene is to give it five stars. 

The restaurants and drivers constantly give you the wrong order or someone else‚Äôs order and when you try to tell Uber Eats, they say they get back to you in 48 hours and they take two weeks to respond. Then when they do respond with proof and evidence, they conduct a investigation and just close the case without customer feedback or appeal. Absolutely terrible terrible terrible terrible service. | Why does everytime I try to pay it‚Äôs say promotion not applied?This has been an constant issue within the last few week,Uber eats fix this issue now. | I know they'll just delete this review. They must be smoking a loud pack if they think 15 dollars worth of delivery and fees is justifiable for a place less than 3 miles away. Overpriced, the menu items are inflated on the app, so you're overpaying by 1-2 dollars per item. Consistently late, my order will 90% of the time be late. An awful experience and pretty much a scam | This is up there with the most unprofessional people and it‚Äôs typical that anyone who wants to ‚Äúbe their own boss‚Äù do it because they don‚Äôt work well. | Worst thing ever DoorDash is way better | I‚Äôve been an Uber Eats customer for years, and obviously throughout that time not all of my orders have been delivered perfectly, which is fine. However, it appears I have had too many of my orders misdelivered or with partially delivered (something completely outside of my control). Despite paying a premium on all food ordered through Uber Eats, from which Uber then takes fees based on the heightened amount, I have been blacklisted from ever receiving a refund ever again through the platform, even when proof is provided showing the misdelivery or missing items. Support agents are only able to cycle through around 5 different responses, there is no way to escalate a case, and they will encourage you to rate the driver poorly if the VENDOR messes up the order. When reaching out to the support via Twitter, the agent threatened to ban my account if I continued asking for a refund on an order in which I received only one of six items ordered, clearly shown in the picture taken by the driver of the food at my door. The driver had even notified support before delivering the food that the entire order could not be delivered. Since Uber is the one placing the order, I cannot reach out directly to the vendor for a refund, so Uber and the vendor can simply pocket that money and give me absolutely nothing. I have had hundreds of dollars worth of food not delivered to me, and Ubers response some is an automated one; ‚ÄúThese orders are not eligible for a refund‚Äù. | This platform was great when they first came out. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer since they started. They start to over charge ridiculous amounts for unknown fees and they have countless issues with orders and deliveries. Other delivery platforms offer better service for cheaper. | I search for Dan Dan noodles and get McDonalds. Seriously not joking. Also ZERO customer support WHEN your order gets messed up. | My order didn‚Äôt come and they didn‚Äôt give me my refund at all the agents don‚Äôt do anything save yall money and go to DoorDash üëéüèæ | Do not cancel your order as you will be charged full price of meal without any real help. | I believe that at this point, we should all agree that Uber eats / Uber in general is horrible with the most greedy approach and nasty service. | After working in a restaurant for 3 years and seeing overpriced food items, I can tell you that it‚Äôs not worth it. The drivers consistently miss items and the restaurants charge extra to make more profit on Uber Eats. | UBER EATS HAS FALSE ADVERTISING OF PROMOTION CODES I TRIED TO USE IT AND KEPT SAYING THIS PROMO CODE CAN NOT BE APPLIED WILL NOT EVER BE USING UBER EATS !! DELETED APP | They will entice you to order then cancel your order 90 minutes later and tell you ‚Äútoo bad.‚Äù Horrible and completely unreliable. Basically a fraudulent business. | There‚Äôs a little pizza spot near me that I recently discovered. Full meal cost $16.33. Was definitely satisfied. Chic-fil-a delivered cost $30.29. Good but felt robbed. Be advised and WAKE UP PEOPLE.

I hope that Google will add a few important features like being able to edit meta data, find duplicates and slide show mode on PC's. That would make it even better | Cross-platform use is diminished on iPhones but improvements are made constantly to the application itself. | Yes üòã | Truly LOVE GOOGLE ARRANGEMENT OF VIDEOS with music!!

Big Smile & tears coming from the joy within my heart ü•≤ü´∂üèæüíï Thanks so much!! | Stop piling up my pictures. I can‚Äôt find anything here | I have been an Android person forever.

Long story short, no matter what product I‚Äôm using, Google will be on it! | Gracias por poder guardar recuerdos en ti | Excelente gracias | Love this app must have on ERRYTHANG | I just downloaded this app two days ago and I have gotten over 200 pop ups and emails. I hate I signed up for this and should have stuck with my iPhone saving everything. Wayyyyy more space and less alerts. | This app has never let me down. It has always been there for me and it has been outstanding. | Great app, easy to use. I love the recommendations and the cute memories it puts together. | Google Photos is one of the first things I look after I wake up because it starts my day off with happiness!   I love looking to watch a memory created with my photographs.  I recommend everyone install Google Photos.  I‚Äôm still learning how to navigate everything, and I need to learn more about sharing anything because I‚Äôm afraid of sharing something to the wrong person.  Need to learn more about messaging the people I share memories and photos.   Absolutely LOVE the stylized and cinematographic photos!!! Google Photos is amazing‚Äî
THANK YOUüòä | An excellent app for keeping precious memories. | Photo library is refreshed infrequently; yes, the background option is on. Editing photos is slow and has a subset of the features available on the Google Pixel. Want to mark up your photos w/a stylus on a new large screen iPad? Tough, go pound sand. 

We pay for Google One and that gives us additional storage, no features. 

This is the bastard child of Google‚Äôs apps. | Excelente herramienta | Muy bueno me ayuda a tener toda mis recuerdos y lo mejor q cambio de tlf y se me pasa todo | Amazing the way you can create almost any type of photo or video from stored pictures and videos with this app. | I like it | One of the bestes!!! | Department of Health Services | Great way to store photos and upload them when you need them. | Wish it was easier to access private photos and share them sometimes lol | Takes

Done | The best photos app | With Google pix All my photos in one place. | I like Google Photos because they tell you when to update your stuff or when to move your stuff what to delete I mean how to delete it how to organize it. It is simple because they tell you how to do everything. I gotta press the button very easy. Thank you, Google Photos. | Making strides thanks to the UX Interface! | Excellent App!!! | This app has helped me save so many memories. Easily accessible, anywhere and anytime. | Love the way you can archive free space.

I really like that it just comes up when there is a deal in a store that I am shopping without me having to activate it. This app has saved me a lot of money. | Don‚Äôt know how to do this yet but I‚Äôm going to figure it out and save money!! | After the last update I cannot login to eBay via this app. The loading ring just spins and spins and spins‚Ä¶ I can login via the eBay website & app just fine. | This app is awesome in theory but the additional steps to have to use this on my iPhone is so tedious. It‚Äôs so much easier to be able to directly go to an app of a seller than they this app in a third party fashion. 

They need to update this app so it naturally looks for deals across apps vs having to use this like an insurance broker middle man. It‚Äôs so unnecessary and I‚Äôve probably lost hundreds of dollars bc this app is so time consuming to incorporate into shopping | Capital one promised $10 for downloading this app what a fraud! I never received it. Uninstalling Now! PS. The app also causes my phone to become too hot. | This is an excellent approach to customers! I love it! | They are very good on finding the best deals for you | I have agreed and downloaded so many times but it doesn‚Äôt give the cash back or bonus $10 most of the time. What‚Äôs the point of the app if it doesn‚Äôt work? | I love using Capital One. | Awesome!ü•∞ | Wxxw | Geec | This app said that if you download the app you have 10 dll credit but when you do it , just ask to choose the offers you want but don‚Äôt give you the credit, this is no right. | It‚Äôs a joke, did not get 10$ | I thought this was gonna be a joke but it turned out amazing! Thanks Capital! | Good app, but I don‚Äôt like the 30 day wait to redeem you points. | This is the best bank to build credit. | It‚Äôs always easy to shop with capital one ü§üüèº | It‚Äôs great | I saved so much and it‚Äôs only my FIRST DAY omg I love thiss app totally recommend . | A very convenient shopping experience | Muy buena app | Very good app . I love it | üí™üèªüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅ | Wonderful, very pleasedüíïüíï | Good | I can browse fine and all that but there is no way to ""check out"". It's seems like I'm not really seeing the whole screen. Makes the app pointless. | Good prices and cool stuff. Thanks capital! | I absolutely love this ! | Hi | Thank u | Just joined have not had a chance to try the app | I‚Äôve been reading over the reviews and I‚Äôm glad you guys have had no issues. However, I‚Äôve been searching on this app every time I shop for almost 2 years, and every time I shop, none of the coupons are for what I‚Äôm searching for. However, the items that I do look up, Capital one shopping, doesn‚Äôt hesitate to send me a notification continuing to shop for the item I was looking for. It also states that I don‚Äôt have to input the code that it‚Äôll automatically do it at checkout time. Currently at Home Depot they have 3% cashback however, last time I used Capital One Shopping for Hulu, it didn‚Äôt work. There was a promotion that said, save 3% on reoccurring charges for live streaming. Total garbage and a total waste of my time. I have sense un installed and deleted all information. Good luck with your app though. | I love it | This is by far the easiest cash back shopping app ever, I don‚Äôt have to go to the app to shop, it just does all the work for me and to top it off, if the store is a participant, the Capital One app automatically runs discount codes for me to try to get me the best price for my items!! It is totally amazing and worth the 30 seconds it took to set it up üòâ!! I promise you won‚Äôt regret it, it is so great to get paid to shop and not have to do anything special for it, like every other cash back shopping app. I‚Äôve made $165 in just 3 months- that‚Äôs incredible to me, and I‚Äôm not even a big shopper but the app works with every online store I shop at so I‚Äôm getting cash back on everything even on shopping apps like Mercari! Some stores you‚Äôll get higher cash back then others,  and they do fluctuate but either way it‚Äôs so great!! I highly recommend this app, you‚Äôll love it!! | Excellent | Muy bueno | I can‚Äôt wait to get my odder 
and look forward to using and shopping more | Muy buena tarjeta muchos beneficios y confianza | Good app very useful and helpful helps keep you up to date and track your history and everything would recommend to anyone with some knowledge about computers | Awesome | Not usually a user of a third-party to shop or when Shopping, however, this app offers a lot of deals, and very convenient to use. Not only to purchase, but to compare prices with the deals, Capital One offers, or any other deals that you find. | Capital One is the BEST, especially because of the Walmart CC.  Amazing to get deals and get quick delivery.  Also, about 8/10, I receive cooperative, respectful customer service.  Thank you so much. | Tell that wench to do HERSELF a favour and get a real job! If I could give negative stars, I would! The advertisement for This app popped up 3 times in a row (come on advertising-you can‚Äôt show me different products?!) over & over & over -double the length of time I play the game-I play a game for60- 90 seconds and this ad blasts for another 120 seconds, at sound full blast while playing a game. And nowhere on the screen is there a speaker to turn off the sound! The sound is turned OFF in my game!! I am quietly playing at 5 am and you jerks woke the whole house. I have been playing the game for 3 hours, and have not seen another ad this morning! I already HAD the app prior to this constant harassment from your advertising! It has made me so angry I deleted it! The app did not meet my expectations, so it was no loss! That screeching wench that does the advertising is obnoxious, annoying and makes me very angry! Capital One-do not harass me again! Delete this app!!! CC: FTC | But they are supposed to be applied at checkout, but that has not been my experience.  So I pay for my items and the savings does not get applied to the sale! Some items I may not have purchased bc I don‚Äôt want to pay full price for that particular item. Not happy. | I like the deals, always something new and for everyone. | It ‚Äútries‚Äù to save you money by running promo-codes  through  at checkout but the codes it tries are so awful that I feel like the app is punking me. And of course none of them ever work! | They got good

There was always an error of some type or another.  Finally got them but by no means is this a trouble free way.  I would get them from another company next time | Was going to a professional hockey game on March 16th started at 7:00pm.  Bought the tickets at 6:15pm from the application and they didn‚Äôt show up in my account until 7:30pm.  I waited out in the cold for 20 minutes before leaving.  When I contacted Ticket Master they said ‚Äúthis event does not give refunds.‚Äù  As if it was the events fault their software didn‚Äôt function properly.  Out $200 and never using this app again.‚Ä¶ | Every time I select the My Events button the app freezes and I have to close it and reopen it to navigate to any other portion of the app. | This site is so user friendly. Easy to navigate. Easy to see the event seating..best purchase experience. | Evidently it takes a lot to order tickets through this app because there is a lot of fraudulent activity occurring. Visa has made many changes to ensure money is not stolen. Ticket master should update their technology | When trying to use the Klarna purchase option to pay for the tickets my card was charged but the screen gave me a message saying the method was compatible. | This app works like a piece of garbage. I can‚Äôt use it with my VPN connected which is suspicious. Then it logs me out every time I leave the app which is very annoying; Face ID doesn‚Äôt work with this app either. 
Navigating the app is difficult; it wants to show the latest concerts/shows on the home page and will bug out and stall trying to update when all I really want to do is search for something, but I have to wait until it feels like working. 
I deleted it today. It‚Äôs too frustrating to use. Will just have to login from a computer I guess. | So easy to find good seats and pricing quickly!  Love it! | Terrible app. Downloaded several times. Could not pull up events. Waste of time. | Constantly logs me off, and every time I try and purchase something it logs me off saying they detected activity that makes them think I‚Äôm a bot (I‚Äôm pretty sure I am human). | Buying tickets on the app is quick and easy ! | I e ordered from other ticket sellers who were a rip off never got the tickets. I‚Äôm confident that this order will go thru. | Recently purchased tickets for family members as a Christmas present. My family showed up to the event and were told the tickets were not valid. Contacted Ticketmaster support and they told me everything checked out on their end so I was out of luck. Will no longer be using them to purchase tickets to events. | Easy to navigate | Opens to a blank blue screen, this app is not built very well. Seems pretty unprofessional for such a large company. | i cant believe they have 5 stars. the convenience of an electronic ticket is not worth the obscure fees, constantly being logged out, the scalping they allow, etc. 

fyi: ticketmaster makes back a percentage of resold tickets, which is why they havent cracked down on scalping. this company should be sued into bankruptcy. this is corporate greed at its finest | This should not surprise anyone that Ticketmaster would not make things easy, especially for their blind customers. Their website northern system is remotely accessible for those with screen readers. The app is no exception to this. arguably, criminal! | This app this the most frustrating app to use. It requires me to login EVERY single time I open it. Even if I put remember me. I've never used an app that requires authentication every single time. Instead of them fixing it they ignore it. This is an existing issue. | Stop logging me out of my account and fix the app. App won‚Äôt load | I always easy the ease of shopping with the Ticketmaster app. But it definitely strings to see all the fees. | Terrible platform. Inefficient, riddled with bugs, makes buying a ticket more difficult and expensive. | I hate the fees | Always a great experience when buying or selling tickets! | I've had endless issues with this app but now I'm not able to stay logged in and it beyond annoying having to log in every single time I open the app | Too much wrong with Ticketmaster to express in a review. Ticketmaster is just very disappointing to deal with. | I wanted to take my grandchildren to the circus and I needed 9 tickets. You have a limit of 8. My daughter tried to help and it still blocked it. We have been trying to figure out how to take all the children for about an hour now! | Other apps keep me signed in, not the Ticketmaster app. Please sign in. Go piss off | Not only did I get charged a $22 service charge per ticket for a local show but then when I go to download the app and get my tickets on an iPhone 15 Pro it doesn‚Äôt load. Tried downloading and redownloading, toggling settings, all kinds of things. Shameful. | Why are they so high? They should be less then ten per ticket. | It won‚Äôt let me pay. Guess I‚Äôll do this from a computer like THE STONE AGE | Even with their new security measures, tickets are sold out so fast and resold way over asking. Ticketmaster shouldn‚Äôt allow people to sell them over face value but because TM makes a percentage of the sold price, they make their profit more than once. Second‚Ä¶30-40% in FEES!? Looks like I won‚Äôt be buying tickets from here anymore. I used to go often but this is ridiculous. | An awful monopoly, I hope the Justice Department will successfully sue them. The app is buggy, it is the most terrible inconvenient app installed on my phone, and the fees that they charge per ticket and for resell are out of control. I wish you all the worst, Michael Rapino. | This has been the worst ticket buying experience ever.

Prices and fees were hidden before the tickets went on sale; the fees were hidden until the very end and there was no option to print the tickets

Terrible!!!! | Typical Ticketmaster bait and switch. Had three tickets in the cart, but it wouldn‚Äôt accept me hitting the ‚ÄúComplete Purchase‚Äù button as the timer ran down to 0:00. But, of course, I could but the more expensive tickets. Total scam. | Took me over 50 minutes to finally get tickets online. Sites kept suspending me and had to keep repeating the sale. Almost gave up until finally got through | Their payment system doesn‚Äôt even work and continue getting U533 error codes from their end. I talked to my bank and they‚Äôre not denying any transaction so it has to be from Ticketmaster. I reach to them and I don‚Äôt get any help after the initial call. I have to track them down and keep bugging but still nothing. This company is a monopoly and they take full  advantage of that by never improving and being predatory. Unfortunately my even is only through Ticketmaster so I bought them through seatgeek and still have to get the tickets sent through Ticketmaster | Very easy to buy tickets on this app. | It‚Äôs a scam they charge these service fees not included in the ticket | I hate monopolies. How do y‚Äôall sleep at night with those fees!?!?!? | Badly organized. Not intuitive. | Cada rato me saca de mi cuenta y tengo que estar colocando mi correo electr√≥nico y me dice que mi contrase√±a no es √≥sea tengo que estar haciendo otra contrase√±a seguido | I cannot see my purchased tickets in the app.  When you tap my events in the app it freezes and the app closes. | Unable to locate accepted tickets in the app and in my online account that were transferred to me. I was only able to locate the transferred tickets via the link I received via Email. Opened the link and saved them to my Apple wallet. What‚Äôs the point in the app if I can‚Äôt see my accepted tickets? | This app needs a lot of work. After about 6 failed attempts in checkout to purchase tickets on my Android, I switched to my work iPhone and it worked fine. If the app has restrictions on what phone actually works, say that up front instead of wasting peoples time and having the audacity to charge all those additional fees. Had another bad experience a couple weeks ago, when tickets I purchased would not show up in the app, after logging out and back in a few times, they finally showed up. Please improve experience or get rid of all those ridiculous fees. | Ive bought multiple tickets for events using Ticketmaster and I‚Äôve never had any issues. Super smooth sailing and I never have to worry about anything. Truly grateful. | There's a persistent bug occurring when attempting to access event tickets, resulting in an error message preventing ticket selection. Despite numerous app updates and sign-in attempts, the error persists. Moreover, the app consistently logs users out, creating significant inconvenience, especially when needing tickets on-site at the venue. | I‚Äôve deleted and redownloaded the app several times, it‚Äôs on the latest update.  When I got to login to my account it says we‚Äôd like yo use the blue site portal. I click yes , but then it never loads the page. I‚Äôve adjusted all the settings on my phone nothing is keeping it from working other then the app itself will not load the login phase. It‚Äôs frustrating. Using the actual website I can sign in but then nothing on my phone will work. Can‚Äôt use it to get into events or anything.  

Again the login part of the app will not load on my phone. Whether I use Safari or another internet program.  Please fix or something | Second concert I‚Äôve been ripped off with. Bruce cost me $480 a ticket. Seems you can‚Äôt see a band for under $380 a couple. It‚Äôs sad and someday when everyone is crying about half-full arena‚Äôs. They need to think back how their greed caused it all. I saw the first ELO tour in 75 and paid $20 a ticket. You can‚Äôt buy popcorn for that now. I will be at their final concert, in the rafters, but I‚Äôll be there.

All I get is an automated reply saying this email is for user support only and it will not be answered. Wanting a refund for a purchase i did not make. Please help | I‚Äôve used it twice already and both times something went wrong. The first time it said I was asleep for 2 hours but I was dead asleep for 8 hours and didn‚Äôt wake up once during the night. And the second time I didn‚Äôt wake up once during the night and AGAIN it said I was in bed for 2hrs 30 mins and said I woke up at 5am when I woke up at 9am and when I turned on the app to turn off the recorder it was already off! | Deber√≠a dar la prueba gratis de 7 d√≠as que ofrecen, que no es as√≠ de una vez te cobran | I tried the app because I was having trouble falling asleep and wanted to track improvements, but every night it tells me I‚Äôve fallen asleep in minutes when it actually took hours. Last night it said I went to sleep at 9:42 pm and was in a deep sleep by 10 pm, when I know I didn‚Äôt fall asleep until at least 11:45 pm. That means I can‚Äôt trust any of the deep/light sleep data or accurately track my progress, so what‚Äôs the point? | My observation is that in white noise, when the loop starts again there is a pause and it‚Äôs noticeable and disrupts my relaxation. | Get this app | I downloaded this app because I was supposed to be able to try it free for 7 days. They charged me immediately and after FINALLY, finding an email address, I have had NO response!!! | I‚Äôm trying to cancel my subscription after four days and can I get a response? Do not use this app they are a scam. | I love this app | Its a nice app but it is really in there for the money. If you spin the wheel you will get the ‚Äújackpot‚Äù no matter what. The ‚Äújackpot‚Äù makes you pay for it. It has a locked things one only limits you to a couple things. Over all not the best but not too bad | This all really helps me sleep gives me advice and more good things this is the best free sleeping app I ever downloaded üëçüëçüò¥ | i have insomnia and this app made me fall asleep in less than 20 mins it even has nap settings!!! LIKE WHATTT anyway it has stories and asmr and white nosies! basically i love it and sometimes i even use it for studying def download it‚Äôs worth the money peeps!!!! | I was supposed to have a 7-day free trial but they took the yearly subscription fee out of my account on the day I signed up for the free trial. | I was charged before the end of the trial period. I asked Apple for a refund and deleted the app. They came back 2 times denying the refund. Don‚Äôt always believe the free trials!!  0 stars! | Quiet peaceful relaxing | The seems pretty good although I am having problems setting up the calendar, | How do i cancel this. I got this app by mistake, i do not want a free trial nor do i want a subscription. | I started the seven day trial period, primarily because they said no money was going to be taken. The next day they debited my account with the one year subscription fee. I‚Äôm guessing that when they said no money would be taken now, they meant at the time of subscribing. It implied the seven day trial period would be free. I‚Äôve requested a refund from Apple but I‚Äôm extremely unhappy they did that, I think the app looks great, but I‚Äôm now I‚Äôm going to cancel it because I don‚Äôt trust them. | Muy buena | When I try to fall asleep and y'all track me and I also do the noise for sleeping it will not let me hear the noise please help I've already tried the app Me+ and I still did not work PLEASE HELP!!! | Typical app on Apple - either too $ or doesn‚Äôt work correctly ‚Äî never mind all Those games that Apple lets people try and all are SCAMS- they don‚Äôt make money for you don‚Äôt be fooled- not WORTH your time | idk why but as soon as i put my noises on i fall asleep in less than 3 minutes | I‚Äôve had this app going on two years now and there‚Äôs a lot of information areas but they‚Äôre not necessarily well explained. I noticed that when I am awake for chunks of time in the night, it record it as being asleep. I wish there was an explanation of what the sleep reading number actually means. I will get something that‚Äôs 95 and I know for a fact I‚Äôve been awake three out of the seven hours. | I'm sure this app works for some people, but not for people with partners.  We watch tv or listen to radio. It picks us every noise. 
App might be good for single people.   It also said I only got between 1 and 4 hours of sleep. | This essentially does what the Calm app does for free. The sleep tracker only guesses what you are doing in your sleep by the sounds in the room. Definitely not accurate. If you have a fan that makes noise or your AC kicking in at night, the app will not be able to monitor accurately. So, who doesn‚Äôt have white noise from a fan or AC? | If you sleep with your spouse it records both of you so be aware it may not be YOU but your spouse | 10/9 | This game help me sleep so much better than before! I used to have problems sleeping but it helped me! | Love all the sound background choices
Mix and match to get the most soothing sound for YOU | I chose a 7day free trial staying nothing would be charged. Lo and behold - charged the premium price the very next day. Disappointing. | When I first used this app I fell right to sleep and stayed asleep I love this app!!! | I always couldn‚Äôt sleep until this app and my sleep study shows amazing 
Short review | It helps up sleep and | Helps me track my sleep very helpful | It‚Äôs beautiful!! | I have been sleeping 1000 times better or more I love shuteye so much | I love this app it is so amazing I can not think of any flaws In this app it has great noises I tried rain rain but it just wasn‚Äôt working that well so I got this app and it is a 10 out of 10 it is awesome for those night when you are like I did not sleep well I wonder why now you are probably thinking why BECAUSE you can track you sleep and set a alarm ‚ÄºÔ∏è it tracks anything in your sleep in clouding Down syndrome in mid night so basically when you have trouble sleeping or breathing it tracks that farts snores sleep talking and even moving so what I am saying is that you should DEFINITELY try this app 10 out of 10 üíã | This app starts off ok, then I upgraded to the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù level then things went down hill from there. The app picks up the noises from my fan as snoring. Then when I upgraded to a new phone the app has stopped working and I can‚Äôt get back to the vip side that I have paid for. So I reached out to customer support. I get a message back that is can take up to 3 business day. A week and a half later I was told the issue has been resolved. In fact it was not. So I messaged back with screenshots to let them know this has not been resolved. And still a month later this is still not fixed and no one has replied to my email. Do not waste your time or money on this app once the company has their money they don‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt resolve an issue *** update tech support I have emailed that email address several time about this issue it is still unresolved fix it or issue a refund please if I could give this app less than 1 star I would please don‚Äôt waste you time or money on this app a month and a half later still no reply from this company | I accidentally bought this thinking it was going to connect with my Apple Watch and it doesn‚Äôt. I have to put my phone next to the bed who sleeps with their phone that‚Äôs stupid | I love the place where you woke me up | First impression it will be an annoying app always posting notifications and asking for good reviews | First, I just wanna say that this app is great because it helps me sleep at night, and as a 35-year-old woman it helps me a lot so I can go to work and get stuff done. Another reason I like this app is because it provides good noises and it helps me fall asleep and a soothing way so that I don‚Äôt have to twist and turn to go to sleep one last thing I like about this app is that both of my kids use this app and fall asleep so I don‚Äôt have to put them to sleep in closing. I love this app because it helps everybody in my family to go to sleep and get good rest at night so they‚Äôre not grumpy in the morning. | So I‚Äôve read some reviews and people say it costs money. Sure, it asks you for PREMIUM NOT TO USE IT if you want to use it just tap the x at the top! The subscription thing it asks you to buy is just premium version. Has it helped me? So do I guess but I‚Äôm improving | This app is horrible. Yes, it will play. Sounds that help you fall asleep without having to pay anything but everything else you have to . You have to have a subscription to do anything ü§¨ so unless you want to pay over a hundred dollars you can get this app it‚Äôs up to youü§¨ | This app is a joke you have to pay for it misleading | It did not help that much but I love it | Kee | I‚Äôve been trying to cancel the app is ok but I just wanted to try it not keep it

Our app is regularly updated to make it easier for you to track your financial progress. This version includes a number of performance improvements and squashes a few small pesky bugs.

I am a nervous wreck all the time! The credit report goes up and down, even when I do the right thing. Last month, Citibank charged his $650 annual fees, and even though I paid immediately, my score went way down‚Ä¶ a lot! I don't need this stress because I'm a faithful and responsible payer. I was happier without Credit Karma! | It is helping me get my credit score together n helps with getting a card that fits my needs n wants I like toys so I have to have $$ for all that n when i don‚Äôt have it it‚Äôs good to have a card available to help me out üòä. | This has help in many areas of life | Fantastic App! | Not even remotely close to mint | Now that Mint sold out to credit karma, we‚Äôre forced to use this app. This app has extra credit cards, duplicate accounts, and inaccurate amounts. It asks me to verify my cards over and over and doesn‚Äôt give the correct options to select. It‚Äôs frustrating. | OK, Mint was far from perfect but it consolidated the accounts where I could easily drill down and keep track of each account in one app. I don‚Äôt need to track my credit score or shop for a car loan on a daily basis but making sure I have the correct amount in each bank account is essential. Maybe the functionality is there but I just can‚Äôt find it. I‚Äôll have to find another solution to replace Mint. üòû | Credit Karma is the Best | I have made 3 attempts to transfer my intuit mint data to ck. None have worked and I deleted my fidelity accounts as instructed and now they are gone from mint.  I will not use Credit Karma and will seek an alternative to Mint. Very frustrating! | App doesn‚Äôt refresh credit scores . Now that I downloaded the app credit score stopped refreshing on the website as well | I was forced to move here from the Mint App (user from 2010-2024). Credit Karma is a sad sad version of Mint. Not being able to budget completely ruins this app for me. I will discontinue use immediately as this app does nothing for me. I‚Äôm so disappointed in the developers. America needs the Mint app and Credit Karma took that away‚Ä¶ this is a tragedy. | I have heard from friends and colleges from the awesome work you do and it‚Äôs going awesome for me too since I tried for myself, you‚Äôre the Best. There‚Äôs nothing to change. Best App‚Ä¶ | Not all Acct‚Äôs are updated | This app is a worthless ‚Äútool‚Äù to use as a replacement for Mint. Mint was great. This‚Ä¶ total garbage. | All but impossible or not very intuitive. The help section on how to do it is less than helpful! | The combination of Mint with Credit Karma is not good. Would have been much better the other way around. Credit Karma lacks a large portion of the Mint functionality. Refreshing of account data is way off and it is an account specific action to refresh. Seeing recent transactions by account seems not possible. No longer my go to app. Sorry Intuit. | Not a fan, the score is NOT the same as any of the bureaus | Before it‚Äôs too late great for keeping you posted about unwanted hard and soft inquiries that can hurt your score I love the alerts and reminders to check my account with my busy everyday it would have been a long time before I found out about anything I didn‚Äôt authorize and remarks from angry vendors | I had Mint, used Mint, loved Mint. When I saw they were shutting Mint down, I asked Credit Karma to delete my Mint data and they effectively refused. They said I had to wait years, then they may. Very shady company. | I love my high-yield savings account! | Forced to move to Credit Karma from Mint but this app does not offer many features we had with Mint. Budgeting, custom categories. Plus 90 % of features are advertising. Currently looking for other options | After having Covid 2 1/2 weeks put me so behind on all my debt I‚Äôm slowly getting back on track with all my credit cards. thank God!!! | The consistent feedback from Credit Karma has helped me to stay on top of my credit history and development with my busy schedule .
Credit Karma makes it extremely easy to navigate through my debt history and it‚Äôs encouraging me to build better credit.

Thank you Credit Karma for helping me build my financial independence.. | I‚Äôve been using Mint for the past five years to track my expenses and pay down debt. It‚Äôs been one of my absolute favorite apps, and I was so disappointed to see it get discontinued. I waited until the last minute to transfer my data to Credit Karma, and I‚Äôm glad I did. The new interface is unpleasant to look at and just isn‚Äôt anywhere near as smooth to use. Such a shame, Mint was awesome, and now I‚Äôll need to look elsewhere for a budgeting and net worth tracking app. | Was advised my account was being moved from Mint to Credit Karma and I should set up an account there. Second attempt and account setup still not working and buggy. Can‚Äôt create a new account as it says email already exists but doesn‚Äôt send password reset email. | CK is horrible.  We want Budgeting functionality back.  Mint was a great app.  CK is garbage.

I‚Äôm now looking at the app called ‚ÄòEmpower‚Äô which is free and has budgeting functionality (although not as advanced as what Mint had).  

Getting rid of Mint was a horrible decision!

I wish there was a ZERO rating to give to CK. | Forced to switch from mint. I have eight accounts and it is not showing up to date numbers. What is the point, if I have been hacked I wouldn‚Äôt know unless I checked each account. | I was forced to use Credit Karma after they shut down my beloved Mint app which I‚Äôd used faithfully for years.  What a terrible transition.  CK is just full of ads and the information I care about, my money, is scattered haphazardly.  The Mint interface was way better and I don‚Äôt know why they got rid of it.  CK is not an acceptable replacement. Rocket Money is slightly better, but Mint truly was the gold standard | Why do people keep insisting on reworking and rebranding things that are already great.  Credit Karma is so much wonkier and weirder to use than Mint.  It makes simple tasks like checking your bank account cumbersome and annoying.  Yuck. | Terrible replacement for Mint.  The transactions and trends are just horrible.   I miss Mint | Nice | Should be able to add additional properties, like rentals and etc for more accurate net worth | I migrated my account over from Intuit‚Äôs Mint app only to discover that the Credit Karma app doesn‚Äôt have the budgeting features that I loved about Mint. Incredibly disappointed. | Why did you have to kill a good product like mint just to make me move to this credit Karma. Even though these 2 products are totally meant for different user base. 
I used to file taxes with you. Now no more. | It seems like the literal only point of this app is to try and get you to sign up for credit cards and take out loans. It‚Äôs honestly unbelievable how much of this awful app is dedicated to advertising terrible financial decisions. I switched from Mint but the app didn‚Äôt even pull my net worth from Mint. My accounts aren‚Äôt all linked, I can‚Äôt see any transactions, I can‚Äôt set up budgets or goals. Closing down Mint was a mistake, I would‚Äôve paid for that app. Now I‚Äôll just have to go pay for another budgeting app because trust me, Credit Karma is not useful to anyone. You can check your credit score in the app of your credit card company for free, this app is 100% useless. | My wife and I loved the mint app for budgeting and then they up and switch to credit karma for some reason.  It‚Äôs not the same, there‚Äôs no budgeting feature anymore which was the whole point.  Hopefully they incorporate budgeting soon or bring mint back?? | What a stupid decision to get rid of the budgeting tools that so many people used for years. How can you say Mint is moving to credit karma when there‚Äôs literally no way to budget on the new app. Boooo credit karma | They shut Mint down for whatever reason and I was forced to transfer to Credit Karma, which does not help at all with budgeting needs. Whenever I try to change categories of purchases, they don‚Äôt save. I can‚Äôt set budget limits. I honestly really dislike this app and am currently looking for an alternative. | This integration was terrible tbis app is nothing compared to mint. Horrible choice to merge these two, if you can please bring back mint asap | Forced here from mint, would have happily paid  monthly to use that app, instead we got this horrible joke of a replacement. Whoever made these decisions need to learn about simple things like polling/surveying loyal user base before making decisions. I am sure all the other budgeting apps are loving the mint death. | I never write reviews. I‚Äôve been a long time user of mint and it was great. I primarily used it to track accounts, spending, transactions, and balances. I occasionally would categorize them. Budgeting feature was nice but I didn‚Äôt use it. 

Credit Karma is awful. It‚Äôs glorified advertising app for loans, credit cards, and any other financial instruments they want you to get. User experience and usability is abysmal.  There is no value in this app. Credit scores are available on most credit card sites. 

I just want to track my transactions. So disappointed in this tool. Even the net worth aspect isn‚Äôt available from the menu. Transactions are lumped and not organized by which card it was on. Just awful user experience and usability. I will be cancelling account in favor of checking my cards individually. Such shortsightedness of intuit on what Mint was used for. | I followed the steps to transfer my data from Mint. Not only did it not work, it messed up Mint.  I‚Äôll be looking for another app. | Like a lot of people I switched to Credit Karma when mint was shutting down, and i guess it works for what it was intended to do. I can see my rough credit score and track my various investment accounts, including balance on Coinbase which a lot of similar services don‚Äôt do yet. That being said its a very ad heavy app and its terrible at refreshing data, most of my accounts are 2-3 days behind makes tracking my banking an credit accounts relatively pointless because a lot can happen in 2-3 days. I assume that CK is using the same process mint did to link accounts as they‚Äôre both intuit products but something needs to be done with the refresh rate. But my biggest complaint of credit karma, and its the same as a lot of people, is that it does not offer a budgeting feature like mint. I know when the shut down of mint was originally announced, we were told custom budgeting would not be available but it could or would be in the future. Make that priority, that was the primary reason for mint. It was a light weight, centrally located tool to track expenses and mange your money. The credit score and net worth calculations were icing on the cake and not the reason people were using it. | This app has zero of the functionality that mint had. It appears to just be a series of tabs with different ads. In my opinion they took A very successful app in mint and very deceptively got users to transfer information to this new app just so they could spam them with marketing. | CK reflects accurate and timely information | Well. It tells you what your credit score is.  That‚Äôs about it.  A ton of adds and can‚Äôt find budget anywhere. 

Terrible.  

Using Monarch now. | While the app is easy enough to use and understand the scores are never accurate.
They‚Äôre always 20-30 points low. | I have a high net worth. If a bill is properly sent to me, it is always paid immediately. I owe nothing because I don‚Äôt need to borrow ( I live within my means). If I need something, I am patient enough to purchase it when I can pay cash, unless their is a discount for financing. I NEVER carry a credit card debt to the next month and most of the time it is paid early in the billing cycle. I am the lowest risk in the financial market, yet my credit score isn‚Äôt 850.
People who do my construction needs, do my work first because they know they‚Äôll not wait 30 days or more to be paid | Great app must have",4.84413,6674794,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ff/73/74/ff7374c8-2ea4-4914-5c90-77502bafe424/8321ba46-e914-4680-ae40-9dbdf5e8199e_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_1-Tagline_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ad/cf/67/adcf6792-dd96-3207-f4d4-3eca633abafa/cfd74cf7-1958-4f06-835b-a88e32433759_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_2-Snipes_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/a4/ce/9e/a4ce9e7c-b152-498a-1161-fd038e2d61af/f26dda65-abce-49b0-8a22-464dfafefe8f_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_3-Credit-Score_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/c3/28/1a/c3281aae-ea03-9f50-a979-a9995db51c20/6f022442-0716-44b2-82aa-903ef92d01d8_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_4-Approval-Odds_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/08/68/c5/0868c588-5832-4b41-8fa7-18ad10d92296/42b19fd3-efdc-4ada-ad8a-91609ac034b6_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_Net-Worth_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/73/43/9c/73439cfa-23b1-9b36-da41-e76b96c0b7b2/aa8fc234-8713-4102-b7d8-863d35b67e6d_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_5-Drive-Score_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/8d/c1/0a/8dc10a50-6d07-9901-5d4a-b3b7ea2a520e/eb2bc923-46a3-4c1f-8d22-c8607c5f9db0_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_6-Credit-Builder_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/db/21/4f/db214ff4-7b33-3b38-a8fc-7c31858654b1/ca4d361b-3356-4bc0-b5bb-c6c19e7838aa_BCD-5653_CO_App-Store_7-Social-Proof_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Is there a reason I can easily use my Prime Sub on the Android version of the app but not the IPhone version? Clicking on the subscribe option just gives you the Apple store pop up purchase screen.

Kinda hard to navigate to rewards but once u figure it out it‚Äôs all good! | Nice | Great!!! | The app is great I love watching the little episodes they really have me hooked the episodes do cost coins but you can earn them from checking in daily watching ads or verifying your email and phone number | It‚Äôs ok | Can you add a comments section, to much more entertaining engaging with ppl watching the clips. | I love all of the shows but when I try to watch a lot it won't let me but besides that I really enjoy it | wish they had more options to buy coins that‚Äôs under $10 | I gave u three because you have to pay and watch ad for a next episode | Amazing | Good | Love it!! | Only put in 2 stars because stories are good‚Ä¶if you get to watch them. Unless you want to pay to watch try another ap .
The coins you can earn each day are not enough to watch even one episode. It took 2 days to get enough. Trying to force people to buy coins doesn‚Äôt work for me when other aps will give you enough for at least a couple episodes a day. Just not worth it
. | Good shorts they are all very entertaining. Just wishing I didn‚Äôt have to pay for coins all of the time to finish a series. | ÔªøI was charged more than the purchases I made. I ordered 1000 for$9.99 and was charged $16.33 and then ordered 1500 for $14.99 and was charged $32.68. | Love the app, even when you check in daily you can get bonus points! | I love is | The plot of the stories is really good. Just wish it was more manageable to watch the most content at one time. And not so much recap on every video. This waste a lot of time. Over all I stay wanting to watch the next episode. | Kinda cheesy at times but very good ‚Ä¶. Couldn‚Äôt wait to see the next episode! | ksufjfifnfktj | Need cheaper chapters. But I was hooked and couldn‚Äôt stop watching lol | I love this app because of the shows | Love the shorts Just wish you‚Äôd get more than 5 coins for watching ad that‚Äôs a minute long when each episode is 85 coins and it‚Äôs 75 episode per series at least | Love love love | Good app to use | I feel like it used to much money for a few episodes but overall it‚Äôs amazing! | i like the app but the only reason i have it is bc of the ads on tiktok if i didn‚Äôt keep seeing those then i wouldn‚Äôt have downloaded the app The only thing I don‚Äôt like is instead of paying to watch an episode I have to watch ads which I‚Äôm fine with watching ads but the fact that I can only watch five a day just kinda gets on my nerves because the one that I‚Äôm watching is really intriguing and it always leaves on cliffhangers so I‚Äôm really eager to watch and see what happens next but I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôve already watched five episodes but other than that are pretty good app | Honestly I would love to find out more of the the first and only story I watched. However, after some calculations, I will not be participating in this Money Pit. 1700 coins (14.99) is equivalent to 20, one minute episodes. You can get coins to listen by watching a 35 second ad and then another ad shows after the episode. You can only do the 5 times in a day. A single episode is 85 coins. If you want to spent that much you might as well watch Netflix it‚Äôs cheaper and you can find movies with acting just as bad. It‚Äôs not worth it. The idea is awesome, the price and quality, not so much. | Great app | Best content ever | It is way overpriced! It cost $50 to watch one cheaply made movie. That‚Äôs outrageous when you go buy the newest highly rated movie on dvd or digital for $25 or less. You can watch it free with ads but it‚Äôll only let you do that for 5 episodes each day. This is horrible because the episodes are only 1 minute long each. The app also glitches and steals some of your episodes that you can watch by watching an ad because it will say you used 5/5 ads before you even get to use them all. So far I have only been able to watch 4 episodes each day because of it glitching, and today I went to watch it and had 0/5 ads used and then clicked to watch it and the app froze. When it finally worked again it said I used 5/5 ads without using a single one. The storyline to the movie I was watching was good, but it‚Äôs obviously a cheap movie with unknown actors and you can even see their microphones in some episodes. It‚Äôs definitely not worth $50 to watch it, and I‚Äôll never be able to finish all 90 episodes especially when I can‚Äôt even watch all of the free 5 (1 minute long episodes) each day. They need to do a $5-10/month subscription instead. It is definitely a ripoff the way it is now. | Love the story's | Considering other apps this is great you can get bonus and watch even more i genuinely like this app | Love this game | This is the best app I have ever used I just with the episode coins wasn‚Äôt used so fast and it‚Äôs always so easy to get hocked | Alr if you don‚Äôt mind the sorta bad acting and having only so many free episodes | I love your stories you get hooked on them. The only thing is that you got a buy minutes or points or wait till the next day does the only thing I don‚Äôt like. | It‚Äôs ok | Don‚Äôt download this app | Really good | Good | I like the story I‚Äôm watching but I paid $10 to get tokens and watched all the videos to unlock more parts of the story. I got all the way to episode 32 and went back to watch everything all together and then closed the app and I had to rewatch the videos to unlock chapters I‚Äôve already watched. And I emailed the developers and I got no response. So now I have to rewatch over 15 videos to unlock up to where I was in the story. | If you like just watching quick videos while your bored or at a doctors office this is it! | I started watching a series and it stopped and plays the same episode every day and you have to buy coins to see more   We should at least get the next video daily | I love watching every drama ShortTV has and free episodes makes it even better!  I‚Äôm on this app everyday watching all my favorite dramas and do not go on a day without visiting the app.  It‚Äôs the best source of entertainment without having to watch an hour long episode!

Thanks ShortTV!

Soupharak D | Most of the videos keep you wanting to see more, love it | You just need a lot of coin and I‚Äôm not buying them | The stories are very good. The stories need to be longer, they're too short.  Also, all of the ads is very annoying. I just want to enjoy a good story without all of the extras.",4.69703,9067,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/70/92/33/709233fe-53d7-ada7-b2cd-0e5323b23bc2/8f24e08d-5f26-45b3-8e37-a4356f087c45__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/23/57/f7/2357f7cf-bf17-eaac-5e24-48be00675721/e19d3fde-0c8d-4cc5-9343-2c4b88ac4eed__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/87/9d/a6/879da601-f364-af40-03fe-2b726c044cf5/0357825c-20f4-4e74-b51a-b01a776b3ae8__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/dc/18/62/dc186202-6236-5954-2b1a-8188bf5a8ad1/0afa9cd2-e9a7-49af-a17c-ae0759a6e770__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/f1/d0/ce/f1d0cef9-473e-ea47-ef22-08a07b083085/8956c821-1fbd-47f6-b239-c2a45cb00acf__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c0/a4/d0/c0a4d0b7-9f42-1b75-e1aa-ba09c7160c56/c6ec9905-4f00-4a51-9a78-bedbef6c5536__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Nice conversation, safe driving and clean car! | Whether I have a dangerous driver or I unlock an electric bike with a flat tire. Lyft‚Äôs business model is ‚Äòpay for it and try again next time‚Äô. Absolutely 0 customer appreciation. Paying full price for a bike that is unridable feels like getting scammed and navigating the app to see no options to fix your issues is just frustrating. | Was charging $48 and ran for 15 mins looking for a driver while it kept telling me 1 min to go. After it dropped me the new charge was $63 and same thing but finally got a driver. 

The app has all kinds of ways to complain about the driver but none to complain about the app.

Second ride: For 15 minutes, it said the driver was four minutes away. Also said that it was an electric Ford fusion and car was actually a Toyota Prius same license plate number. | My first Lyft driver went to the wrong address because the app didn‚Äôt provide the precise address of where I was at. | I appreciate that the app is user friendly. | The best | Lyft will charge you EXTRA IF THE PLACE YOU ARE GOING HAS A ACCIDENT WHICH IS NOT UNDER YOUR CONTROL AND YOU SRE IN 4 lane traffic going 1 feet per every 10 minutes‚Ä¶DRIVE INSTEAD IF IT IS LONG DISTANCE! | Great people always pick me up and always great smooth rides, with great conversation if you want it to where you‚Äôre going. | Always great friendly service and good driving | Dear Lyft, Pay your driver a large cut. As your employees, driver are the one that make the company. | I gotta give this bull a one star . I had a lyft driver pull up to my location , he pulled up and started the ride as I was walking to car . Without me getting in . The driver then drove to my destination without me in it . Lyft customer service is trash when I tried to dispute the charge only thing it kept saying was eeverything looks accurate.. there was no way I could get my money back so I had to call another Lyft and pay again from the same location to destination twice | My Lyft Never Comes To The Right Pick Up Address. | I‚Äôve been taking a cab to the same place for a year and have been paying $13-18 for the commute. The past week the price has been $25-40 for the same commute and time nothing has changed but the price! What‚Äôs good with this? I used this app to save money on rides and I can‚Äôt even do that. Ya lost me as a customer. I‚Äôll ride my bike to work again | Quick and simple way to get from airport to Las Vegas trip | Driver was sent to 200 block instead of pick up requested in 300 block. | Marcello arrived for a pick up with 3 people had the front seat blocked in his small car. Impossible. And now you want to charge me for this non- pickup? 
Do you want return business or not? | Austin was helpful, polite , has a immaculate vehicle and drives very well !! | It was a 10$ ride ‚Ä¶ then went up 7$ after I waited for 50 minutes . Costumer should not be at fault for tropical rainy weather. | This app is terrible, prices always high and never change, they lie and say the price is cheap but charge you a different amount | They took care of us! | Best service I‚Äôve ever experienced in a Ride Share! | Good conversation and energy | Very nice courteous driver, came immediately. Helped with heavy luggage. 
Very good  experience | I have location sharing, and it works on other apps but not Lyft‚Äî they sent the pickup location blocks away from me.  Then I get charged when I‚Äôm not there.  There‚Äôs no way to even contact Lyft about the issue.  So frustrating. | Had a ride cancelled by a driver and was forced to re-book the ride at a higher price | Review by (Stock, option, reviews) HMDLOL Blog by Clint D Hocker. Customer service, zero stars, lack there of; makes it hard to give Lyft: this great product; anything above one star. Warning: ip address sims card swapping | Always a good experience with Lyft | I don‚Äôt know how many times rides get canceled. I will wait on average half an hour to get picked up. If you don‚Äôt have an issue with the driver, there‚Äôs no way to give feedback prices for fluctuate while I am finalizing my ride details.

It‚Äôs worse than pulling teeth to get Customer Support. Chat is useless. They have successfully solved any of my issues. | Both rides were very good to my appointment and back from my appointment both drivers were very friendly and nice Thanks for the good experience it has been awhile since using Lyft But This Was An Good Experience | Starting a ride before clearing all the credit cards which were not on file but still used for Lyft rides: resulted in declines charges and a refund and about a 45 minute delay in travel doing errands for work ‚Ä¶ strange ways we have these days!! | My driver could not communicate with me and drove off with my things. Lyft customer service is incompetent and rude, asking me to pay for his mistake. I decided not to retrieve my belongings since I reported the driver and who knows but he may retaliate. I‚Äôve never had issues with Curb, Arro, Waave, or Uber. (I feel best patronizing Curb because the drivers do not own their cars and might need the money a bit more.) This is my first bad review for anything. I‚Äôd rather walk around Manhattan in the rain without shoes than ever use this app again. | Selected 20 minutes wait and save option. The initial driver canceled the ride; I was assigned to be picked up by a different driver at the exact cost, and in total, my driver arrived in 45 minutes. There was no support to contact anyone. I will never use Lyft again. Uber is a way better service | I can‚Äôt request even rides | Excelente customer service | Love that Lyft is always accurate and gives at the moment car location.
Coupled with the ability to share ride features and get discounts or accumulate reward points when paired with their business partners. | Why is there no way to contact customer support!? I downloaded Lyft and pressed a couple buttons to try to see what ride I could get and the next thing I know it says I can‚Äôt cancel without a fee. I tried to use the new driver code and it says ‚Äúsorry this is for new customers only‚Äù‚Ä¶ I AM A NEW CUSTOMER. I need someone to reach out to me and give me a partial refund. I saw online it says ‚Äúno refunds‚Äù‚Ä¶ then maybe you should at least be available to talk to your customers!!  The ‚Äúchat‚Äù on the app just says ‚Äúthank you for your feedback‚Äù üôÑ. Worst experience with any app or business I‚Äôve ever had. Now I‚Äôm stuck paying $75 to get home from the airport. Insane. | I always find it easy to use compare to other apps and price is also very competitive against other apps. I always recommend using Lyft | So far happy with Lyft. | Tried to use the app for support and they just unpaired me with the driver‚Ä¶. | You can get 3 times cancellation at the airport; in the priority pick up service , and then no ones is there to help you when you ask the reason !

Seriously use a different app ! | Than Uber great job | Lyft has a bad habit of underestimating pick up times and ‚Äúdropping rides‚Äù. Lyft caused me to miss my train after 30 minutes of having unexpected ‚Äúdelays‚Äù and just today caused me to be be late for a meeting. An estimated 4 minute pick up time turned into 15 minutes with an estimated driver pick up in 7 minutes | He was great and soooo helpful!!! Above and beyond.  An asset to this horrible company. | Used this app once on a business trip. Had to delete the app because I could not find a way to shut off their advertising notifications and emails. Very annoying. | In the last few attempts to use the app have become increasingly predatory. In the time it takes me to unlock my card to request a ride my cost goes from $16 to $86. 

Every. Time. | Since Lyft is so good at not having someone to talk with regarding problems, I‚Äôll just share them with everybody. 

I‚Äôve had a driver no show a scheduled pickup to the airport. Nobody to talk to for any kind of restitution. 

I‚Äôve had TWICE in the last 24 hours where the driver‚Äôs app took them a much longer route than the direct route, of which multiple map apps showed no problems with the direct route during my trip. I had 9 minutes and 26 minutes added to my trips because of this. Nowhere in the app has a place to address this issue nor a person to discuss this.

Lyft is wasting my time with faulty projections for route travel that THEY provide, which then leads to uncomfortable conversations with the driver who doesn‚Äôt even know that the app is hurting us both. 

Very fitting I have to type out a long review instead of a quick chat with an employee. | Lyft prices are extremely high. A 2-mile ride could cost between $20-$25. Also, the estimated wait times for a driver and the estimate times of arrival are often inaccurate. I have arrived late to work or other appointments due to these inaccuracies. 
Also, not many drivers are educated about the laws governing service animals. I have a service animal and have been denied rides several times for this reason, despite such actions being illegal. | Horrible customer service. | It can never find where I‚Äôm at then says cannot find or complete location I hate this it‚Äôs always more expensive than Uber too for no good reason",4.91586,14041652,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2c/99/ec/2c99ec40-05a5-84c0-4e98-5761c883a267/ad8d9f43-d9e7-42e3-8a2f-54cad1c02c49_01_EN_iOS_5.5_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b7/fd/54/b7fd5425-7384-b2da-a530-b028ece8015a/d5fa7365-daca-4cb7-9692-702c4d9baf43_2nd_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Wait-and-Save.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b1/37/02/b13702a7-0967-31bf-9c33-8565918f457d/630ab86c-f972-42ab-85f7-cdb8516a1c37_3rd_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Airport_PU-DO.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1a/e1/af/1ae1afe1-02bd-0c94-9496-152ee5ee0d9e/2863083c-4557-4c17-87f4-d01b461f9013_4th_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Multimodal.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cf/d8/4d/cfd84d0a-aa20-631b-9903-1da2b92ea636/d90ac141-5d0f-4d5a-a6c0-b55ef678f154_05_EN_iOS_5.5_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/20/ca/71/20ca7126-d355-6065-ec15-cf01e13cc452/bb5e67b7-6b70-4e7e-aa73-37c4ef953a27_6th_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Keep.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Located perfectly to 
Town of Frisco üòÉ. Place was clean and Cute.   Selfishly I want to give it a bad review to keep 
It available for me üòú But I cannot üò° wife said Don‚Äôt You Dare.  We will be back. John and Karen Admirand | The availability and options that are on this website are absolutely endless. I‚Äôm glad this site is available. | Just wasted 45 min trying to use confirmation codes. Kept changing every ke of minutes. | Buyer beware! We tried to rent a house, the homeowner took the money and then told us the house was already booked. VRBO did nothing to help us except state that ‚Äúthey are only the app and can‚Äôt help. You understand, right?‚Äù  Nope, I don‚Äôt understand how someone can take money for a purchase, not provide what we paid for, and not be  required to refund that money back. No responsibility? No bookings.! I‚Äôll stick with a hotel. | Overrides iPhone language settings to whatever country your iPhone settings are set to and you cannot change it, rendering the app unusable to me. | My account was hacked .   I was promised a call back by Mia.    I‚Äôve not heard back.    The app has many unresolved glitches which impedes my ability to do business.   Security is a serious issue and I‚Äôm very disappointed in the lack of responsiveness! | As far as the app actually works it‚Äôs just fine like any other app 

The reason for the one star is their policy for property owners we had a property owner that canceled last minute. Apparently we ended up paying all of the fees despite the owner canceling. Moreover, there‚Äôs no ability to leave a bad review for an owner that canceled last minute. Looking at another app, we found the same exact property. Switching to a new app now! | We loved the place and had a great timeüòÄüòÄ | Constantly | App keeps locking up. Had to get out & go to Google search. 

It‚Äôs terrible! | The development was beautiful and house was pretty . There were a lot of issues,  but the contact person tried their best to make it right. After some work all worked out fine and our family enjoyed our stay with our family for family wedding. The contact was very responsive. | We had a great time. Plenty of seating in the living room and around the dining table for our family of 8. Everything was clean and welcoming. | The main issue was the cleaniness and tge accommodations of the unit. My wife has asthma ttge importance of a clean room is very important. The main issue was the amount of dust in the unit. We had cleaners address the issue the first day but we continued to find more . Tge unit had not been properly deep cleaned in some time.The team was quiet concerned about the issues and hopefully they will be addressed . The owners need to fix the mattresses in the master bedroom. These seemed to be very old and not comfortable at all. Tge view and location is great but some attention to detail and love from Ownership would make this unit shine. I hope this message will translate into some positive change so future guests will have a more positive experience. | Easy navigation and great selection of homes | They become your home. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè | This is absolutely horrible! Can not find my trip that I paid in full. I better have a place to go to this weekend. This will be my last time booking here. Very disappointed!! | Perfecr for our group - three ""older"" couples from up north. Pool was clean and warm, the kitchen was well equipped, grill worked like a charm and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Convenient to shopping and sights. The host was very responsive to our questions and we hated to leave! | I have been looking for that single story Big Bear cabin to enjoy and return to and this it! Close to all, great beds, cozy family room, jacuzzi, yard, dog friendly, and very very clean. 
Will love to return in the summer! | I can‚Äôt figure out how to check rental houses without a complicated sign in process | We went to St Pete for a wedding.  This little apartment was perfect for a long weekend.  We could walk to restaurants and a nice little park.   the staff keeps the little courtyard area neat and the weather was nice enough to relax outdoors.  There are laundry facilities.  Definitely room in our unit for no more than a couple.   Kitchen well stocked with full fridge.  Would stay again! | Capri 1 was  the perfect home for our group‚Äôs vacation to Hilton Head Island. We have been going to Hilton Head for a number of years and this by far was the best! The home was beautifully decorated, spotless, comfortable and equipped with everything we needed to make our stay so enjoyable.It‚Äôs location was near the beach and shopping areas too!We voted to return next year! Jim and Celestine Ghigiarelli Jessup,Pa. | I had to cancel my trip 1 day after booking i asked for a refund but if course the denied me. I really wanted to go on this trip. Had been years. Then I even tried to change the dates they wanted to charge me a fee to do that. At  least I wouldn‚Äôt loose my money. But I think that‚Äôs robbery. I understand an inconvenience fee maybe but 50%. I spent 670 for 2 days and my refund was 303.00. That was so unfair. I would never recommend them to anyone. The  customer rep was rude. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DONT BOOK A TRIP WITH A THIRD PARTY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. | Unable to use because the app displays everything in a foreign language even though my account is set to English and US on the website. I‚Äôve tried several times to reload but the app keeps displaying everything in a foreign language. Country settings are blocked from changing. No choice but to delete | Adem√°s muy agradecida con la due√±a excelente servicio. | They‚Äôre literally better then Air B&b they have everything they have ‚Ä¶and more !! :) | We were looking for a place in Key West that was close to everything and had room to relax. This place had it all! We were able to conveniently walk to everything from Duvall Street to the harbor to catch different excursions. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed relaxing in the little sitting area. Would definitely stay here again if we ever went back to Key West! | We stayed at Van‚Äôs condo while in town for a wedding. He is an amazing host, you couldn‚Äôt ask for more. The condo is in a great location,, overlooking a park and a quick easy walk to Coligny which has SO many restaurants. We will definitely stay here again!! | I thought AirBNB had unreasonable/hidden fees until I downloaded this app. Somehow $178 per night room comes out to $700 dollars for two nights. Lousy. Just stick with Airbnb or go through a hotel. I do not envy the poor schmucks who work customer service for this company. | Makes booking a rental, so easy no matter where are you going to fancy or to just regular plain and simple it‚Äôs all made very easy on this application | The condo was spacious and clean.  I loved the feel of the bed!  Location of place was a plus!  The only problem was that we were on ground floor- which is really below ground level in the front.  We‚Äôre all elderly and it was difficult to go up and down stairs.  The elevator was helpful but not close enough . | A friend and I stayed for a week and it was lovely. For the same price as a hotel we had two separate bedrooms, bath, living room, and a full kitchen. Super clean place.
The host was quick to respond to any questions and when we had a problem, was there in minutes to fix it. 
Beds are comfortable with nice bedding and pillows. We had ample parking right near the door. 
The host even provided local coffee, teas, and cocoa. 
The Trax transit station is just a block away if you don‚Äôt want to drive in the city. Just hop on the train with an all day pass for easy sightseeing. 
Will stay here again if I get the chance. | I came to Ames for Dance competition and I missed part of the competition because I had to stay at rental and wait on a plumber because the tub and toilet would not drain then it leaked in the bathroom and all over the kitchen from the water heater drain it backed up there and out. The beds are said to be all queens but they are more like full size and one of the rooms was extremely hot and while another room was freezing cold. Very disappointed. I didn‚Äôt need it for one day and had to pay anyways because I didn‚Äôt find out till it was past the change date then I had to deal w all of this. There is a huge cleaning fee yet they ask u to do most the work. U should not charge such a high cleaning fee if u ask the people to do all the work! | This villa really needs an update. It really was not comfortable, but it was livable. There was no view from inside as the tree needs to be trimmed back. The furniture really needs to be replaced as it‚Äôs not comfortable by any stretch we spent as little time as possible in this villa. we could hear the neighbor downstairs as well as I‚Äôm sure he could hear us. There was a smoky smell on occasion through the vents.. | Loved our stay!!! It was very clean and super cute!! | They app freezes up | It won‚Äôt show if ppl are rebooking the place and if it booked they it should be taken out so we won‚Äôt book until it‚Äôs free to be booked. | I have used vrbo on my desktop computer and have an account. I recently indicated some favorites in my desktop account.  When I downloaded the app and logged in with the same username the favorites were not there. | Our first time with VRBO it was smooth sailing.  Good prices.  Good communication.  Easy website to navigate.  Love it! | I booked using VrBo only to have my money taken and no reservation provided. Now I am waiting on a refund that could take several days if it comes at all. | Hire someone who understands customer needs please | The house was great! The town was so nice and the house was a perfect location to downtown. Unfortunately my father got very sick while we were on vacation. The host was so supportive and helpful. We had to extend our stay and the host personal contacted us and even came by to see if we needed anything. I highly recommend this property or any property this host provides! | Very thankful for vRBO last-minute getaways and flexibility with great options. Bonus- App is easy to use! | The condo has the best views of the ocean, absolutely spectacular.  We saw so many whales spouting and actually saw a group of males pursuing a female whale right from the lanai.  And let‚Äôs not forget to mention the turtles swimming in the waves along the shoreline of the beach.  The condo was well stocked and very comfortable.  Loved it, hope to be back soon üòÅüå∫üê≥üê†üçπüê≥ | I‚Äôve used VRBO for years,  in several states and have always been very happy, both with accommodations and customer service.
Thank you,
Rosemary | We very much enjoyed our stay at Cinnamon Beach. The condo was very well appointed and kitchen had great amenities, like insta pot and rice cooker, lots of pots and pans of all sizes. Patio overlooking the beach is huge and was a favorite spot.  We never made it to the pool, so cannot comment on that. They have a cabinet full of all types of games which we enjoyed with our grandkids. 

Only negative I have is kitchen was absolutely bare of any food items. NO staples like salt, (there was some pepper) sugar, oil or vinegar.  While not a huge deal, would have been nice to know beforehand. 

I would definitely stay there again. | Trying to book for next year. All my saved properties for Naples Florida show a red banner that says ‚Äútechnical problem‚Äù and I can‚Äôt book any of the properties. Spent an hour in the chat room, but the problem is still there. Trying to use my iPhone app, but can‚Äôt find my saved properties on it.

Fortunately I am in Naples  now an will go to a local realtor tomorrow. Much easier! | Too expensive | Very difficult to navigate for Host. | The email I originally signed up with is no longer in service and I cannot access it. However, I cannot get into my settings to change my preferred email address without getting a confirmation code sent to my old dead email. There‚Äôs got to be a better way. | I ve used VRBO in the past with no problems. But the last few times ended up being nightmares. VRBO eventually made it right with a refund, but then I had to scramble to find a place that was available during my scheduled vacation time.

I lost $2100  and did nothing. I contacted them immediately after the money was sent- both Venmo and the receiving party.  I entered Otto‚Äôs Garage- and the vendor Crazy Otto‚Äôs Garage came up. I pushed SEND and immediately realized wrong vendor. The vendor upon contacting him- laughed and asked for $3000 more. Venmo did  nothing. 
Yes-they could have have restricted Crazy Otto‚Äôs Garage usage. Banned him from Venmo. The investigation would have been extremely simple. Venmo and Crazy Otto Garage received  texts/messages immediately after. There was no request or material/services provided. There are texts from vendor asking me to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù more money in order for him to return my accident. So Venmo gets 1 star-Crazy Otto‚Äôs Garage gets ‚ÄúThief‚Äù do NOT do business with them. | I tried to establish my new bank and Venmo said they put two small deposits in, but they are not in my bank. I open Venmo with an old bank account number back in 2020. I did delete that account and added my new account. However, Venmo can‚Äôt seem to verify that account although they said they have sent two small deposits to it.I think the system is terrible. I logged into my account and I see my sons transactions in another state. He has a completely different phone number of course. | Will not accept my id to verify my identity and provides no help when trying to verify a business account that they charge fees for. | Thank you Venmo fir being patient with me while I I‚Äôm learning your business. I feel safer than just not having anybody behind me but I feel like you guys have my back and I appreciate that I‚Äôve gotten scammed several times and I‚Äôm tired of it and I feel you guys give me some safety protection you, PayPal. | Very disappointed in this app. Even after following the reps directions of in-installing then re-installing the app, I‚Äôm still getting error messages that I have tried installing too many cards. What ever happened to pay-pal?
I‚Äôm going to look into other payment options besides Venmo. Even if it means sending out an actual check. | I pay my fianc√© every month for groceries, rent, utilities, etc and now all of a sudden Venmo is declining my payments to him. | I got rid of PayPal years ago because getting in contact with customer service was exceeding difficult and they did not honor the protection they love to brag about. Anyway Venmo being owned by PayPal nothing has changed. There‚Äôs no way to contact customer service and when I add my credit card even though it worked in years past says there is an issue with the card you tried to add. So screw these clowns they won‚Äôt get my business if they are going to operate like crooks. | ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåüí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏ | Easy | When I got my money on Venmo it wouldn‚Äôt let me transfer it or do anything with it | As late adapting 62yo white Midwestern female, I got Venmo because my children were using it. I have learned to love it and I wish I could pay everywhere with Venmo. I feel is it safer than cash.app and Zelle. | I can‚Äôt get my money returned because it‚Äôs still pending after 2 weeks and the person no longer has an account. So I will soon be canceling my account | My account is suspended. They said in order to fix it i need to upload my id. I did that twice and it's still not working. I can not seem to keep using it and it's very unfortunate. I've been waiting over two months and still have not heard anything. I've even email and haven't heard anything | Best way to make payments | Ridiculous | Easy to use and always reliable. | Now it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a personal or business account, the ‚Äúpurchase protection‚Äù allows someone to mark their exchange as a good or service(which my friend never did it was still labeled gift) and venmo took a 10%+.10 cut for the transaction. I‚Äôm not selling anything, and after talking to CS I have to contact and beg the sender to dispute and get my actual money? Great scam they have set up in order to make sure venmo now gets paid on everything you do in the app. Delete your info quick! | So Far So Good. Mobile Check Deposit Makes It Better Than CashApp!! | Venmo has been so helpful with all my transactions both with the virtual card and the physical card. Great app and flags possible fraud for you to review and approve or deny. | Suspended my account for no reason at all haven‚Äôt even used it in a while, so why suspended? | Te best I love and enjoy this app | Froze accout with money to be deposited. Trying to talk to anything but a bot is not possible.  Very poor business practices | I‚Äôm having a major issue. I open the app and it‚Äôs frozen immediately. I can‚Äôt navigate to anything. I want to stay on top of my credit card use and I can‚Äôt see anything. Help! | Is easy to use I like it for my business. | easy access | Since requiring everyone to update their bank account, Venmo no longer recognizes my bank. And there‚Äôs no way to pay with the balance in the Venmo account, so how am I supposed to get my money? Beyond frustrating. Zero stars. | I am a fraud, according to venmo, just attempting to access ‚Äúmy own money‚Äù | Everything for business and personal accounts worked out great. Just still haven‚Äôt received my card and can‚Äôt make payments even when my bank is linked. | Alternate accounts with tandom pictures pretending to he you to see if they can direct the $ elsewhere! Dont use this app!! | Trying to replace a lost canceled card. App will not allow it. Keeps blocking with error widow | Venmo makes transferring money to others , very simple and direct. I have never had any problem with the app . I highly recommend Venmo. | Literally been trying to set up another account cuz I got kicked out of mine when I changed my number. And now my bank won‚Äôt work. Always seems like I have problems whenever I use Venmo. Def gonna just get a cash app | Terrible customer service. | There were fraudulent charges in my account. I placed a claim as requested and it was denied because I had money in the account that covered the fraud. | Be aware !!!! Venmo WILL steal your money, they have illegally stolen mine and I‚Äôm now having to look into which legal action to take to get this issue corrected since their service support refuses to do their job. Very disheartening service. | Account was compromised and erroneous charges made. I filed a claim with Venmo, all they did was kick me out of my account on two occasions AFTER I had secured the account and verified my identity as directed by Venmo.

Ultimately I was told that the erroneous charge made on my compromised account were normal and that no action would be taken.

My bank was able to recover the funds only to receive a harsh email from Venmo to contact them first prior to going to my financial institution.

Grade: F | Since when does Venmo request access to all bank‚Äôs transactions. Last time I will use Venmo | I was buying some things from marketplace and the merchant used Venmo so I made a transfer from my bank to my venmo account this is on Friday afternoon it‚Äôs now Monday morning and it‚Äôs still pending and you can‚Äôt stop this or make it disappear like it never happened when nothing has moved anyways ??!!! Nonsense in my mind I want my money ! As soon as I get my money back after paying these unwanted fees I will be sure to close my account with this stupid app! | Easy to use. Quick transfer of money. | Great app. My first thought was Venmo , Venmore not another app to send and receive money. Promise me to do everything with no issues. 
Turns out Venmo works very well and customer service is very helpful . I‚Äôll be using Venmo before any other . | Got some notifications that my account was getting attempted to sign in to - was unable to change my password, remove my bank account, or freeze the account. So I was completely exposed with no chance to save it. Only option was to close my account. Will just go to one of the competitors | Idk why, but Venmo has started ‚Äúlosing‚Äù my bank info, even though it‚Äôs displayed when I try to make a payment. It then forces me to reconnect, but that doesn‚Äôt work immediately. Super frustrating. Will be using Cash App going forward. | Venmo did nothing to stop fraud on my account. | Venmo is horrible!! Solely on the fact that if I send money from my cash app to my Venmo it never instantly transfers the money. I always have to wait 30 mins before the money is available. That defeats the whole purpose. Especially seeing how I‚Äôm paying to get it instantly transferred. Every other bank or prepaid card instantly makes the funds available, why can‚Äôt Venmo! Get it together! | Can't verify identity no matter where you look | Annoying texts daily that you are approved for their credit card.

This app is great for that and it the quality is good while using it. | From tamiya aka miya | Thank you for sharing this app | I think I completely gave GAVE GAVE UP on Google Duo/Meet. It has now been removed off my devices due to ongoing issues within the app. For example I want to decide to video call my spouse at lunch time I initiate a call however I cant hear or they cant hear - or another thing is volume they sound really low. Im forEVER having to end the call and call a second sometimes a 3rd time before it seems like there are no issues . 

FACETIME HAS YET TO FREEZE OR HAVE THESE WILD BUGS WITHIN THE APP SO CONSTANTLY / GOOGLE GET IT TOGETHER WOW! 

There is no point in having a app on your phone that gives you as many issues as the google meet app. | Great I love seeing my bff | Good beacasue you Can chat with a frend you even can contact with your family | I could finally call my friend because I can‚Äôt call her on the normal messages so this really helps me call her on FaceTime
I love this app!!!!!!!!!üòÅüòÜüòÅ | Too cold ü•∂ . | LOVE I got see my great great grand son and the rest of wonderful children | Despite of having trouble with internet in iran google meet works extremely well | Delete asap | It‚Äôs just always glitchy and never works as good as FaceTime does | I am a psychotherapist working at home with clients on GD, and loving it. There have been no problems and always is very clear. I was using Zoom before and had so many difficulties. I now encourage and recommend GD to all of my clients, family, and friends. Thank you for providing this! SP New Mexico | It is a quality app gotta say it‚Äôs way better than some of those video chat apps & maybe it‚Äôs just me but it has better internet connection idk but it‚Äôs a real good one | Even tho I use FaceTime too I also use google meet for my android friends! Have always been satisfied with it! | I used to have a samsung, I would always use it to only call my cousin and the quality was pretty good. i was able to screen share and draw and everything you couldn‚Äôt do on iphone when you have the app. once i switched to apple the quality for everything was 100% better, i love the app the only downside is i can‚Äôt screen share anymore, it doesn‚Äôt lose a star for that but they should think about adding that!! | The first ring is medium loud but after that first ring you can‚Äôt hear if it‚Äôs ringing. 

I‚Äôm still having the problem. I don‚Äôt see an audio button at the top of the page. I searched for that bottom when I was on a video call and when I was not on one. | I gave you five stars because you‚Äôre the best app you let me talk to my mommy because she doesn‚Äôt have iPhone so I don‚Äôt have to FaceTime her. I could just do her and that‚Äôs why I gave you five star. | No comment 1 months 100 time update this apps | You bring people together and that is a great job. | The best | Gegeven | Wonderful connection | 10/10 so good stuff on this app | I will use it every day | I called my old friend and we had a wonderful conversation. Thank you Google Meeting. | I love it it is so beautiful to see my family and friends faces | Everything just deleted no numbers nothing | Thank you for great service!thank you for great services! | I really couldn‚Äôt hear at first and the face was blurry. | My parents have androids and I have an iPhone. We don‚Äôt live close to each other, but when I video call them on meet; I feel close to them. Glad to have this option. It has also helped them maintain a close relationship with my sons, their grandchildren as well. | On the website you can start a meeting by typing the name of the meeting you want to open both this app and the old app don‚Äôt have that function
Seems like a duplicated app of the same features. | Like why do we have to write a view? It‚Äôs like stupid or something. | Iouytyuop we can get the one on one of the few other ones I need | Is a great app | The connection was very good. Thank you Meet. | For example no PiP while in call | I just wanna say good job. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥ | It‚Äôs is poopy | This app made me call someone I don‚Äôt even know when I was trying to call my cousin but over all it was pretty good so I gave four stars | 80/10 | Idk what to say it‚Äôs good I guess??? | The only thing you can tr the only way to get the best out is to have it in the first time you try it | Perfect the quality. | This is so good I love this chat now I can call my granny because she does not have a iPhone she has an android and I can FaceTime her anytime I want and my friend too she also has an android and my paw paw thank you google meet.keep it up!! | ÈùûÂ∏∏Â•Ωüëç | This app is so cool and fun. I couldn‚Äôt call my cousin because she doesn‚Äôt have a iPhone. Then google meet came along. I could call my friends and family. Also I rate the 3 stars cause I want u guys to change name and logo back. But other then that, LOVE THIS APP!  #appsofunandcool. | Soon as I downloaded the app wouldn‚Äôt even let me continue as myself | Is because the app have effects that the lil characters and the bunny one is my favorite and she‚Äôs a girl and it‚Äôs cute and another thing is it‚Äôs a meeting call on here and it‚Äôs like fun so yeah . ‚ù§Ô∏è | Google meet is a great place to call but I can‚Äôt screen share but my friends can?! And it‚Äôs annoying because I want to screen share! But Google meet if you see this we‚Äôll go to my account and pls let me screen

You can catch up on stuff you haven‚Äôt seen before or was late seeing and I appreciate that and also the new shows that I never seen before. Thank you Peacock for what you do. | Most Everything else is mental illness/leftist garbage! | Always logs me out. Can‚Äôt get back on. | Poor connection | Prepare to scroll scroll scroll every time you want to watch local news. This needs some kind of favorite/save to list option. | Used this app back in the day. Came back to download and they want you to PAY $6 a month with no free option anymore. AND YOU STILL GET ADS üòÇüòÇüòÇ what are y‚Äôall smoking??? | Salem and Rumble | Can‚Äôt turn off auto play. Burns data if you fall asleep. | Please introduce an option to disallow or disable video scrubbing on Peacock. The touch anywhere video scrubbing is far too sensitive and I always inadvertently fast forward or rewind whatever I am watching. It‚Äôs awful. Make it stop or restrict it to a smaller portion of the screen. | Streaming signal is always interrupted. And, it is not my internet because all my other Apps work just fine. | I purchased a subscription. Got receipt from Apple. Peacock App keeps telling me there was a problem with payment. If I try and subscribe again. I get a message that I‚Äôm already subscribed. Deleted. Reinstalled. All the same still. It‚Äôs  Not worth the struggle to try and fix. I lost $6, but I learned what app to not bother with again. | Too much long commercials! | The app crashes and service is out sometimes | Bad movies but there are some good ones | I like the shows & options but the app itself is annoying . I dont like that it auto plays a different show after you finish yours and it then stays in your continue watching gallery forever unless u watch it too. It‚Äôs frustrating because theres a million things in my continue watching list that i will never watch. | This app disconnects from your tv if you don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre still watching fast enough. There are tons of repetitive ads and weird volume issues. The only reason it isn‚Äôt one star is it has later seasons of Brooklyn 99. | Fix it please. | Add every 5 mins and right after an ad 30 secs later another one comes to many adds | Love this app | Is it no longer on Peacock? | Stop the auto play! There is no way to turn off auto play. I don‚Äôt watch often because of it. My entire family hates it. | The Peacock line up with many of the biggest races in professional cycling is 2nd to none The US coverage and also the feed from Europe is outstanding. It is exciting to watch and follow the biggest stars and teams leading up to the tour. I originally purchased for the Tour De France coverage which alone is the best I have ever seen. Now I am able to watch many of the spring classics as well.  I also love the fact in some races you can choose between euro and the american feeds which is a brilliant idea as I have never seen this before either. If you are a diehard cycling fan look no further than peacock as they have the world of pro cycling covered for you to enjoy any where and any time. Chapo Peacock, well done! | I would give five stars if it weren‚Äôt for this one thing: is it truly necessary to ask ‚Äúare you still watching‚Äù after EVERY episode? It‚Äôs inconvenient, especially since I have to use my phone as my tv remote. I watch tv while I wash dishes, I can‚Äôt exactly hit a button every 20 minutes with wet, soapy hands.
Also, your ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù section only holds onto what you‚Äôre watching for about 2-3 days. Not exactly useful. | Continue watching does not start where I left off, it always starts at the beginning. | very useful | I love that Peacock has wrestling. What I can‚Äôt ignore is the multiple, consistent crashes when streaming a video on a Playstation console.

If I can make it through a 90 minute episode of RAW, that‚Äôs a good day. On a decent day I submit 5-10 crash/bug reports. On a bad day, the only thing that loads on Peacock is the ads. That‚Äôs the one, reliable thing I can say about their streaming service. 

If it wasn‚Äôt for wrestling I wouldn‚Äôt use this service or recommend others use Peacock. 

The repeated glitches, numerous crashes, black-screens that require force closer of the App, and the amount of bug reports sent that go unheard, are the reason why I reviewed Peacock streaming service on Playstation for a 1 star out of 5 stars. | All other streamers let us delete shows from Continue Watching. Why don‚Äôt you? | Way too many irrelevant commercials! It‚Äôs horrible!! | I pay extra for no commercials and it makes no difference. Rip off. | Makes me watch commercials and then freezes. I have to close out the show I‚Äôm watching and reopen it and then it starts the commercial round from the beginning again. Among other problems. I hate this app so much | Terrible ui | Any streaming app that does not offer an option turning off Autoplay AND the ability to remove shows from Continue Watching is an automatically 1-star rating and poor review. It‚Äôs 2024. Do better. | won‚Äôt let me watch because too many people are watching on my account but nobody else is on it | My family loves the programming on this app but cancelled service because the app is very glitchy and freezes constantly. If you guys fix this app you will get a customer back but until then I will pass | My favorite scene from Oppenheimer is when he meet the President of the united state of America mr Harry s Truman. | Ended before credits rolled. | This is a pretty great streaming service, in how it pertains sports events, and in my opinion, a great selection of legal dramas. However, peacock only has a certain selection of certain genres which is the only reason I didn‚Äôt rate it 5 stars. | Stupid smurph movie comes right up.
Sports that I want see‚Ä¶. Loading‚Ä¶ loading‚Ä¶ loading‚Ä¶
But the cancel subscription works fine. | The application appears clean and workable through Apple TV. It is fine until one attempts to continue watching a movie or series. Then the app forces the user to restart what they were watching. This app is only worth the frustration for exclusively licensed content. | Ads out of nowhere. Sick. Unsubscribe | Love it | i love this app it has my favorite shows and movies however all the ADDS. are annoying i get its 5.99 but still all these adds are annoying. | The movie continues to pause. | There are way to many adds  this app is so bad üò° | Please have someone contact me regarding my account‚Ä¶ I was charged twice in one month | I like the programming, but we didn‚Äôt decide to pay a premium price for a channel like this to endure commercials. | I have a yearly account that has no ads and all of a sudden there are commercials on everything | I can not download  peacock ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Tremendous waste of our time. | If you need to do any kind of cancellation and you actually paid for the cancellation policy for your trip or trip protection plan through Expedia, they will still charge it $200.

I will never use Expedia again. | So good | Quite frankly, using this app and the online site, I‚Äôm tired of seeing the quiz puzzles to show my human side, to make sure it‚Äôs me, and not a robot or hacker. This happened, constantly, during my searches, and then the screen would freezes, or could no longer search for stays. I never have issues with Booking.com or Airbnb, or any of the other sites. I tried Expedia last month and gave it a break, and then tried, again, after some good reviews, but to no avail, kept having the same problems.

Frustrating to use. | CANNOT even sign in!!! | Expedia is misstating the facts, lying about the tipe of ticket they‚Äôre selling and end up taking your money because you‚Äôre left with literally no way to reuse credit. $1,500 lost because this crooked company. | Do your self a favor and use booking.com atleast they take care of there customers | Expedia claims that if you book through them they will honor and reimburse you if a lower price is offered after you book. They did not honor this with a Hotel room that was booked for $383, and we showed up to our booking and the same room was $177 the day of. The property wouldn‚Äôt match the price and Expedia refused to help as well. Scam | The amount of frustration I am having trying to do what they advertised could be done is hard to overstate. | This has been a terrible experience I want to talk to a real human being in customer service and I‚Äôm not able to. This is disgusting.
Therese Paivarinta | The assistant at Enterprise was very courteous, informative, efficient and friendly. | Total Lie you book double room and you go there and its somehow becomes one room with one bad. Expedia customer service is - freaking minuse I called them to get the refund and I talked with different people and all of them about nothing. Just trying to say its not our fault and somehow its not the hotel fault either that I paid extra 100$ . Thank you Expedia- you cant help me Expedia I already talked with 3 different Expedia representatives and all of them write us letter bla bla bla and at the end its not our fault in just one word bull‚Ä¶ again Thank you | Our stay was very nice.  The staff were all very nice and check in went well.  We were surprised with a complementary pizza, salad and drinks bar when we arrived at 6pm.  The room was very spacious, clean and the kitchen was perfect.  This part is in no way the hotels fault, but I almost wish they would put notes in each room reminding people that if you are not on the ground floor when you let your kids jump from bed to bed and off the beds and run and jump it is very loud for the people in the rooms below.  My husband was having surgery the next day and had to be there at 5am.  We wanted to sleep early, Not possible with the people above us.  They did not go to bed till after 10.  Until then it was basketball or what ever, at times the walls actually shook when they jumped so hard.  Ok, the place was great, stay if you are in the area and I hope you don‚Äôt get rude jumping people above you! | When I reserved a 3-day stay with Expedia, I specifically noted I was disabled (left ankle fused). However, when I arrived in my room, the furniture in the room was not safe for me to habitat. The couch and the chair were very close to the floor. I sat on the couch and noticed immediately, I could not get up. I ended up crawling back up to stand. While doing so, I hurt my knee. There was also bar stools. With the disability I have, I am unable to raise up and balance my left foot/ankle on the chair. 
I contacted the Property I was staying at. I reminded them of my disability.  I told them there was not one chair I could safely sit on. In turn, they could not help me.  They recommended that I contact Expedia.  I called Expedia Customer Service. However, there was a recording stating that the office is closed due to the holiday. From where I am at, there is no holiday. Also, I was under the impression that I could contact Expedia 24/7.  So, I had to find a different property to stay at that accommodated my disability. Someone from Expedia should have helped me. According to the ADA for a disabled person, requested accommodations were not honored. I expect to get a full refund for this accommodations not met and for the hardship I had to go through in finding a safe place to stay. | My partner was booking flights (not on Expedia) and told me we were flying into Fort Lauderdale so I went ahead and booked a car rental on Expedia. Last minute flight prices went up so she changed it to Palm Beach Airport. I contacted customer support to update my car rental literally 10 minutes after booking and was told I can‚Äôt modify it and that my only option was to pay a $100 fee to cancel. I called the rental car company and was told I couldn‚Äôt modify it through them either since I booked with Expedia. This is obviously a cash grab sketchy practice by Expedia to take advantage of costumers. I‚Äôll never use them to book a car again. 10 minutes and I can‚Äôt modify? Are they serious? | Wonder

Super breakfast | Spirit airlines is horrible. I had no idea they charge so much for bags, and I didn‚Äôt plan for that much extra money. I will try hard not to use them ever again, because the plane flight was the same as other airlines with the cost. WOW. They are bad. | Customer support chat or live agent is useless .
No answer for weeks. | Very difficult to get an actual person on the line. When you do they are foreign. If locked out of email, there is no way to change it. You must create a new account and lose status and points. | I assume the app has been recently upgraded since I can no longer access my account even after repeatedly entering codes to confirm my identity.

Horrible change | For as long as I live I will NEVER book anything through Expedia ever again. They have lost me as a customer for life. Last week a distracted driver slammed into my car while I sat at a stoplight. The resulting accident totaled my vehicle and left me banged up pretty bad. My honeymoon was supposed to be at the end of April but because of the accident I am going to have to postpone until I‚Äôm healed and have a new car. I called Expedia to explain the situation and cancel my flight. I was refused a refund and they explained they could only offer me a flight credit valid for 1 year and I said that would be fine. Then they told me that I was going to have to pay a $400 penalty fee for rescheduling my flight. I talked to everyone up the chain of command asking them if there was anything I could do to waive the fees and not a single person offered any sort of resolution. I‚Äôve never talked to a customer service team who so obviously did not care. I was told my situation ‚Äúdid not qualify‚Äù for a reschedule without the penalty fee. I am sitting on the end of my bed covered in scraps and bruises, sobbing. My honeymoon is completely ruined, I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs going to happen anymore, and I will NEVER for as long as I live forget how I was treated by the Expedia team. No customer service what so ever. All I wanted was to reschedule my flight without having to pay a $400 fee. My advice? Use literally any other travel website. I‚Äôve never been treated like this by anyone else. If you book through Expedia, make 1000% sure that nothing is going to make you have to miss your trip or reschedule because if something comes up their team will offer you no help or customer service whatsoever. Booking through Expedia has very likely cost me my honeymoon and I will NEVER forget it. Head my advice and book through literally anyone else. I wish I had.. | Reserved a midsize SUV in January. No problem. Got a good enough rate. But after standing in a SHORT line for an half an hour. The attendant leaves! Just puts on his jacket and walks out the door. Huh? 15 minutes go by before the only Avis attendant takes over. All together, we spent an hour waiting to be taken care of. 

Oh‚Ä¶ and then‚Ä¶.we wait another 15 minutes for them to bring up my least favorite midsize SUV. ‚Ä¶ a Chevy equinox. I was hoping for maybe a RAV4. 

Anyway‚Ä¶.a really frustrating and annoying experience. I think they get no more than one star for this fiasco. | Arrival to Austin‚Äôs and pick up this amazing convertible as easy and car is great.

 Now highly recommend. | Terrible not user friendly | Expedia seems to not value his customers as it refuses to give us a minimum support when we have an issue due to our reservation,we had a reservation with RecordGo,already paid for and they refused to come to terms with the third party company and just decided to keep the money,as we had to make another reservation at this car rental location. The reservation was to my girlfriend‚Äôs name but also with my information,she was not the driver so she did not bring her passport because it was not stated that she needed to bring it. Once at the office they said she NEEDED her passport even tho i had mine and we had all the information matching. Expedia refuses to help us and basically stole our money. Will NEVER use them for anything. | I Made a hotel reservations, but it‚Äôs not showing up anywhere on the app, and when I click on the link in the email, I just gives me an error when it opens up the app back up. 

Also tried to change my email address and it gives me an error stating it‚Äôs ‚Äúon their end‚Äù.

But this app is horrible, and frankly, really bad for their business. The app crashes ALL the time and this has not been fixed for months. I finally realized having the app installed was not worth it with it continually crashing when I'm trying to shop, and just removed it from my phone.

To get started i was trying so hard to get the ‚Äúnike dunk low (black and white)‚Äù drop, and to continue it was the worst experience of my life. I was up since 8 am, setting up my phone and application, i had my wallet and cards ready, i had apple pay ready i had my macbook ready. And unfortunately it did go through and showed pending, and it only took me around 20 seconds to order the shoes in a Mens 13 for its re release on Nike selling for 110 dollars, a literal steal from the resell value of nearly 300 bucks at the time. But unfortunately i did place the order i went with Apple pay as i love its security feature and basic inability to have my credit card inform stolen easily. So i placed the order it showed pending for a long time and for what seemed forever. I went quickly to look at what sizes were left and everything was still showing in stock so i thought i did so good. To note these were so post to be a reward for me since i wanted these  whole entire summer since i worked my butt off for so long, So obviously these shoes I've been anticipating since i found out cause i wanted them so badly. But to go on, so the shoes go through it shows pending for a long time just for nothing to happen‚Ä¶ when i ordered the shoes and it showed pending it was still 10 am on the clock, i had requested the shoes with seemingly no issues right, WRONG, the order didn‚Äôt even process, so i go to message customer service when i tell them my concern about not getting my order yet since by this time the shoes were still not SOLD OUT it still showed most of the shoes sizes were still available including mine. And they basically condescendingly tell me that ‚Äòthis happens time to time‚Äô, upon reading other reviews and also going to call customer service twice because the first time they hung up on me in the middle of me speaking they told me that this had happened to hundreds of customers for this drop and that my issue wasn‚Äôt isolated whatsoever‚Ä¶ and i knee there was just no way i couldn‚Äôt have not gotten the shoes i was ready i was literally one of the first shoppers who were on the app and website ready just for them to be like, ‚ÄòYou unfortunately didn‚Äôt get the W‚Äô, when i read that i literally bursted out with rage because i felt so unbelievably disrespected because it was worded in the most condescending way possible along with other words before and after in the customer service message from this filthy worker named ‚ÄúKaylee‚Äù, because it was just beyond something else with these people they only care about money they dont care about even having a proper customer care team and clearly alloe their staff to make disrespectful condescending comments‚Ä¶ and basically when i called they basically made me wait 15 minutes twice‚Ä¶ and basically gave me a f off, and a excuse that i should have been earlier when i repeatedly said i literally had it pending within less then 30 seconds. And they didn‚Äôt seem to get it through their thick skulls on the fact i was also saying when it was pending every size was still available‚Ä¶ and before you ask my wifi and phone and devices were working completely fine it was clearly the application itself messing up everything and ruining hundreds of customers experiences and basically telling them to f off and wait for the next drop with no indication of when will there be another drop‚Ä¶ I believe any consumer would agree if they were out into my unfortunate situation that what happened was just plain unfair and just absolutely unfortunate and that nike didnt bother to remediate whatsoever what they allowed to happen because i heard even before this that the app and website likes to f people over by not accepting payments, not going through with orders and this is the website and app and they clearly need to go fire their app management and replace off of them and fire these filthy staff members and replace them with people who actually care about customers instead of disrespecting them and blowing them off‚Ä¶ | this app provides no purchase history but is forced for people shopping at the nike store... why? what value does this offer the user? in my opinion none - forced download to purchase - please tell me why this app offers me anything i want or need | When logging in the app it gets stuck on screen saying welcome back and doesnt ever load, i just wanted that megan thee stallion set  üò¢ | Can‚Äôt cancel order after 30 mins even though it‚Äôs still on ‚Äô preparing for shipment‚Äô | Every time I download this app and log into my account, it just sits on the loading page.

Always full of bugs and never gets fixed. | The Nike app used to allow me to add my Nike pass QR code to Apple Wallet. Very unfortunately this feature seems to have been removed. It is a real pain to have to open the app (especially when it logs you out), click Profile, then click Pass when buying something in store. Please reinstate true Apple Wallet support. Your App Store listing still says you support it, but apparently not. | Never ordering again, you get 30 minutes to cancel or else your stuck with product and they don‚Äôt modify it neither. Now I have to wait for it to arrive , I won‚Äôt see my money until it arrives and I send it back and then still have to wait for them to send me money , honestly worst experience ever, never again am I ordering online again . | Great application! Neat and intuitive! But as a Product Manager myself and also a user of the competitor app from Adidas I believe that you need a restock notification feature. Adidas has one and is a great way to stay ahead of the competition and guarantee revenues. What other sign of a good product than people lining up and waiting for restock of a certain product? | First I got multiple codes to make a account and they didn‚Äôt work then after it finally worked it said I wasn‚Äôt eligible for a account | Everytime I try to sign into the app, it just doesn‚Äôt go past the ‚Äújoin now / sign in‚Äù screen | Seems they choose perfect reviews only most of the time, I‚Äôve written a review about my bad experience about one product and now I can‚Äôt find it in the app! | Unable to join or sign up | Good god I will never buy anything from Nike again, Wal Mart makes higher quality clothing! | Should not have an app that doesn‚Äôt work without login. | Y‚Äôall need to make the vapor 15 MDS CR7 cleats in a size 5 In we on | It‚Äôs absurd that I can‚Äôt even see product without first authenticating. What kind of shopping experience is that supposed to be? | Could no longer use my ship‚Äôs address to deliver my purchases like I used to. Tried both the app and website but neither worked. Contacted the chat agent and didn‚Äôt receive any help. | If you enjoy woke nonsense, then by all means download this app and support them. | I downloaded the app and tried to make an account, but they wouldn‚Äôt send me the code to verify my email. I can‚Äôt sign up without verifying my email so I can‚Äôt even make a account. If I could give this app ZERO stars I WOULD!! üôÑüôÑ | I haven‚Äôt been able to log into Nike on my web browser for months, and now I can‚Äôt log on in my app either. I keep getting an error message that states ‚Äú Error parsing response from server‚Äù.

What is going on here?  Fix it! | I downloaded the application, when I log in it says that an update is needed. There is no update in the App Store. | Can‚Äôt log on. So frustrating. Keeps sending me back to main sign in screen. | Pls bring back the old Nike tech fleece | As far as I used to purchase my favorite set of clothing and shoes online, everything was just fine. But ever since 2022, seeing every shoe sticking with only a specific surface makes the daily use of the shoe products unbearable and unsatisfying. 

However the all time thing I loved most about this app was the filtering to choose which product I wanted to buy. If there were product prices from outlets available, it would probably be better. | Good at refunding if order is lost or stolen. However I did pay and extra $30 for fast shipping just for it to not come that day and the day it came it was lost. The courier dropped it at the wrong house. Overall this app is decent it can definitely improve . Sometimes items sell out and they‚Äôll still let you purchase it online and then cancel your order . | Who thought it was a good idea to remove shopping by sport?! All I care about is Nike golf. I only want to see all the golf stuff. This new update has made that difficult. Terrible UX decision! You made it very difficult for me to shop. Very frustrating. | I love nike, I have many things from them and I always wear them. I recently got the app and I tried to add something to cart and it never worked. I have tried everything, restarted my phone, refreshed the app and logged out and back in. Nothing has worked. I really do love nike and their brand so I was super disappointed with this. :( | This app was amazing 2 years ago. It‚Äôs honestly a mess now. Not even possible to find what I want anymore. We used to be able to search by sports. It‚Äôs just a mess to put all shorts together.

It brings value to my life everyday. It takes Bible reading on another level. I absolutely love daily stories, great daily inspirations, devotional reading and even guided prayer. I also love reading plans. I just finished ‚Äú win a war in your mind‚Äù plan and it had huge impact on me. Thank you very much to all app creators, developers, contributors. It is really world changing app. | Awesome app. Keeps me connected with the Word. | Facil de usar, lo mejor es que si no puedo leer la biblia, la puedo escuchar. | This app allows me to read the Bible at any given time. I understand it. Period. I look forward to reading./hearing a new verse each day. | I love this app. It allows me to connect with God every morning. I share scripture on social media from this app. The meditations are truly God inspired and I am often introduced to new people of God! | Best app everyone should have it | I love this app! It has numerous reading plans and bible versions. I have been reading the chronological reading plan and it is broken down into bible verses for a year. If I miss a day it allows me to re-set the plan. I have also listened along to my daily reading while driving. No excuses whatsoever for not having time to read my bible! | Great app | I love this app cuz it gets me into the Word daily.

The app works well and is intuitive. I wish I could just click ‚Äúon my way‚Äù and move on. They seem to be asking more questions to upsell coffee or gather new details. | The Target circle app has a glitch in which you cannot use the Check Out function if you want to use Apple Pay.

However, when you use the Apple Pay tab you are not given the option to use the target gift cards at all. So, you are forced to choose between using Target gift cards or Apple Pay. There is no option to use both at the same time. Please, fix this problem. | Their quality, affordability, and convenience of drive-up and pick-up of their products is the best. And if I want to stroll through the store and take my time, the associates are so welcoming and helpful. Thanks, Target! | As a disabled senior citizen whose be shopping online with Target many years, I‚Äôve seen tangible improvement on their site. More than ever, Target makes it easier to shop online. Thank you Target, for working hard to make it easy. | Love the easy of shopping and if something doesn‚Äôt work out I can always return with no problem. | I love Target & I go there quite often in the morning to get my coffee from Starbucks & was excited about the new drive up feature which I noticed posted on a sign going there yesterday. So it‚Äôs not that the feature is unavailable at my location the app just makes it impossible for you to access. There‚Äôs no clear indication on how to access it within the app & when I used the search bar an ad for drive up popped up but again nothing to help access it. | For the 3rd time in 2 weeks, you have lost our order in the mail. You can‚Äôt compete with Amazon if this is how you perform. | PLEASE SEE THIS AND HELP ME!!! 

I can no longer order online through the app! It always says ‚Äúitems not found‚Äù no matter where or how I click! I reached out to support but they just gave a vague answer. I rely on mobile ordering pretty heavily and have had to start shopping at Aldi because there I can actually get my order. 

For Target when they see this: 
Any time I search something (tested on three devices) it will say ‚ÄúNo items found‚Äù with an error message over it ‚ÄúOops, something went wrong. An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt even click on the weekly Ad or grocery tab. 

My phone is fully updated as is my app. I deleted it 19 times and redownloaded it. Please fix my app I love target!!! | I love target. I have shopped there for decades. But their app to order things to be shipped or delivered is a disaster.  It constantly changes what I request from shipping to delivery to pickup for no good reason. It tells me my address which has existed for 75 years does not exist.  It is difficult to move from the cart to add more things and there is a ten dollar delivery fee unless you pay 100 for a subscription. Good selection of merchandise and god speed but way behind in customer service. | Best app and place to pick up your order. Polite and fast service!! | I love online shopping at target! Super easy to navigate the website and there's always great deals with circle. | Always super content shopping at target. | Is super convenient, fast & I love that I can just drive up and pick up my things | Applied for credit card on the app to do a same day pickup order, selected the add card to app once approved to shop right away. After applying on the app, it sat and spun about 6 min, then went to the page to apply again. I checked my email and had a congrats approval email. 

Card never added to app to use
Called target support, they saw it active but couldn‚Äôt do anything, told me card will arrive 5-7 days, didn‚Äôt care that it didn‚Äôt do what I wanted it to and why I applied for a store credit card. 

Financial bank couldn‚Äôt help either.

Do not apply on app, it will not work correctly. | App | Love how fast things are delivered. Thank You from Decker family | I love the Target app, easy to find the products I need and arrange drive up service | I wish it wasn‚Äôt 2 hours especially if it‚Äôs only one or a few items would be nice but other then that convient to not have to bring in your toddler | I have to verify my red card in wallet every time I try to use it in store. This is ridiculous, should be able to use pin or Face ID rather than verify every time. Makes wallet feature useless | Loveee | While I like being able to change the location and see which locations have an item I want, I also find navigating the locations and methods of pickup confusing. I wish they had something equally thorough but more user friendly. | I literally love target. Love everything about it. I just love it here | I love target | App shows me the item in stock at local store and price. Then I get to the store and the price on the shelf is higher. Please update your app to show the correct price at the store. | Website and In Store Merchandise inaccurate information also this company DOES NOT CATER TO PLUS SIZES IN THEIR STORES 4X women plus sizes, 10 wide width shoes, items that are listed in weekly sales in not available in my location in the store yet the website and app false claims of items availability.
Gas and taxi isn‚Äôt cheap! | This app gets better and better. I can‚Äôt believe how much I rely on the deliveries and pick ups. I get alerted when something I like is on promotion. It‚Äôs just an awesome shopping experience! | What‚Äôs not to love about Target! The app is fantastic when I don‚Äôt have time to run into the store. | I love the joy lab apparel it‚Äôs so comfortable and fits your body so well !! | I never have issues with this app and it‚Äôs very easy to use. | Target always delivers packages in a timely manner. And always well package so thank you target! | I love it! They give you a map to find items, a history of your purchases so that you don't have to keep a receipt. You can find that DPCI the employees ask you for in the info section of the item you're looking for! And the wallet feature has all your stuff payment, coupons, circle!! It finally is easy to use! You can scan items anytime to add to your shopping list or check for coupons! This is the best app so far. Please don't change it! | I can‚Äôt log into my account. I deleted and downloaded the app again. | Most cases it will tell you this item is 15% or such amount off. So you believe it will do the correct math for you and tell you what you will be saving. But if you do the math yourself you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs wrong. This has happened many times especially noticed it happens more with a buy 3 get one free or buy 3 get a $5-$10 gift card back. The percentage is never correct. It‚Äôs been an issue for as long as I can remember. Not sure if it‚Äôs a glitch or if Target is purposely doing it | So, let‚Äôs talk about the Target app ‚Äì my new shopping buddy. As someone who‚Äôs always on the hunt for the best deals without sacrificing convenience, I can confidently say, this app gets it right. | I love the ease of use in the app!!!!! Easiest shopping spree and mood booster! | This app is so awesome! They keep most of the items updated such as items left and have options of stores that carry that certain item. You also have the option to pay ebt which is great for when you‚Äôre not feeling well and need some groceries to go | I love how easy it is the use the Target App. I also love how convenient it is for me to use the pick up service. | I have used the Target app for so many years, but this latest update is really dumb. So much so that I had to write a review and hope the people who work on it read this. I use my Target app every single day to keep my grocery list, and when I go to the store to reference my list and to look up items, to re-search items, etc. The latest update has put the list in an awkward place. The update before was also awkward. The original location was best - as I actively use this list. The very worst thing about this update, though is that you cannot tap on the item in your list to look at it or to compare it to other similar items. This is an awful feature. It‚Äôs basically a mistake. To make matters worse the recommended the item cannot be tapped on either - please fix this awful glitch! | voiceover testing was not done. searching is hard and when an item is found not possible to hear descriptions. i was searching for coffee cups and not travel mugs either and first thing comes up in search is travel mugs and i was interested in something microwave safe ceramic and larger than 8 ounces. aapp got worse since i installed it. | Love the target app! Love the fact you can shop from home, have the items delivered or pick up. If you don‚Äôt have same day available it‚Äôs 2-3 days delivery can‚Äôt beat that. I love Target! Love that they care for our budget!!!! | Log in and put in my zip code to find my store and it just sits on a black maps screen forever | Hood work good work | Charging over 20 cents more for the EXACT same products as Walmart, when I want to give it to ya .. | I love target üéØ‚ù§Ô∏è | I Love Target | The app could be easier to use. The overload on the home page is confusing. Give us an easier way to shop. | Me encanta target üéØüëçüèº | I love the order ahead system, and how they do not upcharge prices or provide a service fee for ordering online at a local store. Target stands out from their competitors for this feature and I continue to shop with them thanks to this. 10/10 would recommend. | The people at our regular target store work so hard and it‚Äôs frustrating that the customers have to price check most every item.

1260755201,"com.zellepay.zelle","Zelle","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zelle/id1260755201?uo=4","Zelle¬Æ has partnered with leading banks and credit unions across the U.S. to bring you a fast, safe and easy way to send money to friends and family. Money moves quickly - directly from bank account to bank account. If your bank or credit union offers Zelle, you already have it in your mobile banking app or online banking ‚Äì if they don‚Äôt, the Zelle app will make it easy for you to send money to enrolled Zelle users that already have access through their financial institution.
Zelle. This is how money moves¬Æ.
Using just your recipient‚Äôs email address or U.S. mobile number, you can settle up simply and safely with almost anyone you know and trust. Even better, Zelle does not charge any fees to use the service. (Mobile carrier or bank fees may apply).
GET STARTED:
1.	Download the Zelle app.
2.	Enroll using a Visa¬Æ or Mastercard¬Æ debit card linked to a U.S. checking account; or 
3.	Enroll your U.S. checking account by using your online banking username and password, if your bank supports this feature*.
4.	Choose a person to pay, or request money from, by entering their U.S. mobile number or email address.
5.	Confirm the amount and hit send. If they‚Äôre already enrolled with Zelle, they‚Äôll typically get the money in minutes. If they aren‚Äôt, they will be notified and can follow a few simple steps to complete the payment. 

*Some banks allow customers to enroll in the Zelle app using their online or mobile banking username and password.

It‚Äôs stated the buyer who was purchasing something from me also needed to pay me another $400 dollars to verify a business account and that I would need to refund that $400 before the amount was deposited in my bank account . I called the bank and  the bank person told me this is a scam . So my bank account is locked for 48hrs . Very scary. | no me permite crear mi cuenta me sale error y para variar me bloquearon ‚Äúla cuenta‚Äù que nunca pude crear üòëüòë. | My bank offers Zelle , had someone send me money and im still waiting for Zelle to release the money to my account been over 11 days and still depending | A recent updated doesn't allow certain card‚Äôs anymore‚Ä¶ which they didn‚Äôt mind still using after the fact‚Ä¶ I only noticed after trying to switch cards‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you were still getting business. | Request or sending money, very fast and convenient. No hassle and get it done. Money in your account. | I‚Äôve had a ton of problems with them.  They used to always instantly transfer the money, now it can take a week and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even work then and you have to call and have them fix it and they‚Äôll tell you to wait and there‚Äôs nothing you can do.  They will take the money from you though, just not transfer it.  Avoid at all costs! | There is a bug in this app that causes your account to stay logged in on iPhone11, even if you logout through the app and don‚Äôt have Face ID enabled. The next time I open the app after logging out, my phone number is there and no password is requested when I click Next. The only way to log out is to delete the app. Very poor security. I have already called Zelle regarding this issue but no fix. Unacceptable for a cash transfer app not to log out of your account properly. | Terrible experience with Zelle  they don‚Äôt tell you up front they don‚Äôt recognize certain phone numbers or phone companies. | Y‚Äôall need to fix these ‚Äúconnectivity issues‚Äù. Every time I try to login I keep getting error a106 and it‚Äôs getting annoying. I have full bars of service and 5G internet. No reason I should be having connectivity issues! Please fix! | Quick yay | Just beware. Fraudsters called me using my banks name claiming a person tried to charge an airplane ticket from the Middle East using my debit card. When the person began asking for information I got suspicious and hung up. They had my email address. I checked it and found they had sent me emails that said: ‚ÄúSyed Ahmed‚Äù has been added to your Zelle contacts. Three more emails all with different Arab names were sent saying they were added to my Zelle account. Do not click on anything in an email that looks like this. I reported this to my bank. No one from my bank made these calls. It is not Zelle‚Äôs fault. People trying to fraud you are getting better at posing as legit. Keep your eye on any cash transfer apps. I have the Zelle app but I cannot recall the last time I used it. | I love that i can send direct payments with no fees. | This app seems to always have a error for hours or days at a time just to log in 
Then some times it won‚Äôt even let you send money out 
It works way better if you have it straight though your bank they need fix these glitches | I like Zelle, but it takes way too long to load on my phone. | I used to have Zelle through Wells Fargo, but I switched banks over a year ago and my current banking institution doesn‚Äôt work with Zelle. I don‚Äôt mind that at all. I prefer Cashapp anyways. 

Here is the problem.There have been a handful of times since then where I have been sent money through Zelle by accident (usually a friend forgets I don‚Äôt have Zelle anymore or something like that) and there is absolutely NO way for me to be able to receive that money or for them to at least get that money back. It‚Äôs just out in the ether, I guess, I don‚Äôt know. But there should be an option to reverse a transaction that hasn‚Äôt been accepted yet or to decline a transaction that you can‚Äôt receive. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous and borderline thievery. | There is no way to sign up using an e-mail. | Zelle is great. Simple to use. | This app is constantly locking me out, forcing me to call just to unlock my account. Who's in charge here? It's like they're being run by some paranoid boomer who doesn't get tech at all. Seriously, a friend sends me $60 while visiting here from Vietnam, and when I try to repay them, I have to wait until Monday to call and unlock my profile because of some security issue with receiving money from someone unfamiliar. It's unbelievable! | A really unpleasant experience. It doesn‚Äôt work more often than it works. I highly recommend using a different app. And I know a lot of banks partner with the app but this app makes you remember why we still have checks. It would take less time, be less painful and work more often to simply write someone a check. Heck, it would be easier to get in your car and drive a few miles to an ATM. I do not recommend this app. | Why does it take so long to connect to Zelle!!!! The wait it kills me!!!! | I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù  use the app because my bank ALLEGEDLY has Zelle through their app‚Ä¶‚Ä¶EXCEPT THEY DONT. SO I JUST CANT SEND MONEY. | For the past few days the app has not allowed me to log in. It says that there is No internet connection, and asks me to enable data or WiFi.
Funnily enough: Data connection works fine, both cellular and WiFi. Cellular data is enabled for app. Location tracking is allowed. Reinstalled the app, same result. Tried on multiple connections, same error message

Reliability is important for a financial app, what if I was in a rush to send or receive cash? | Terrible accessibility | Completely inferior to Cashapp. | I was quite happy with Zelle until they briefly were incorporated into one of my two bank accounts. Now that bank has dropped them and neither of the debit cards from either institution will link to Zelle. Meanwhile I have make new arrangements with all the clients who were paying me through the app. It‚Äôs a bit alarming that suddenly two different banks have dropped them. | I recently worked with someone and sent money.  Within minutes realized it was a scam and requested my money back.  Zelle customer service was not helpful in my recovery from the thief. | If you‚Äôre going to be doing work for businesses, and they want to pay you through the Zelle app, it won‚Äôt work. Zelle blocks all businesses from paying to personal accounts. | The loading of the app takes forever!!! | It works well however it takes forever to open and sometimes you give up and pay with something else | This is super cool, Thanks a bit scare sometimes üôè | Excelente app | Zelle put a hold on a transfer of $450 I  NEVER RECOVERED THE FUNDS and I got verification from Zelle it was being processed | This app needs to get their stuff together. Had the hardest time with a locked account and when I called and had it fixed, they started making repetitive payments within days of each other. Sometimes with amounts that are no longer used. I hate this | Makes me sign up each time I open the app, family can't send me money. It says my card isn't working. (I have a new card) | Aplicaci√≥n excepcional,me encanta | App is horrible can‚Äôt even make an account any other apps process is 10x easier | Is anyone having problems with code not being sent to phone number | WOODFOREST NATIONAL BANK | This is a scam site. Zelle would never ask for a debit card or credit card to sign up | I had Zelle for a while and it was ok for the first couple years. In the past year, however, I can‚Äôt even open the app to send payments. Had to start using other apps to send money. Tried several times to open it on my phone and I got the loading circle of death. üíÄ | This app is trash, | Easy to use | Siempre hay fallos en crear una nueva cuenta con este app. Ya intent√© como 6 veces crear una cuenta y me sale errores despu√©s errores. Muy p√©simo el servicio | I used to have this for years and it always worked fine but I tried to change my card since it expired and I tried to change it to the new expiration date etc and everytime it just says some error. I don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs really annoying and I NEED it to work | Zelle keep giving me a Error code 2900 what does that mean? And I cannot link my bank on it | There should be a way to allow higher send amounts when using the app. My financial institution does not use Zelle services for sending. Thank you. | Working well | Money is sent and received super quick. Very awesome that‚Äôs integrated with Discover bank checking account. The Zelle app is very slow to open up. The performance of maneuvering within the app is garage. They need to speed this part of the app big time. 3 stars until they make logging in much faster. | Once it expires, they un-enroll your email entirely and you have to start your entire account over. Stuck in a loop and can‚Äôt pay people that I need to.",4.75201,524760,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/98/ba/c1/98bac15b-b1fc-c194-9237-eaa393416a33/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/53/b7/e6/53b7e629-0fd0-94a3-eeba-dc262ec0a51e/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/0c/14/a3/0c14a38a-188c-7f26-4e58-32f18697daf7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/2f/aa/c5/2faac51d-3625-4927-8876-e147f76adec9/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/79/d5/6c/79d56cc7-f528-6128-47ad-619a95d6ecc8/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

At first it was a few older shows and movies that I could watch in my free time‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt bad, and it wasn‚Äôt great.  It was simply good. 

However, recently Tubi has literally skyrocketed with improvements.  There are great shows, their own made content and the user interface is excellent. 

I find a plethora of show choices, and they are including newer (recent or new shows and movies) content.

I would guess they had a change in upper management, or hired someone brilliant.  As these changes have moved Tubi from a background app, to a forerunner that I watch regularly. 

5 stars for most improved tv/movie app. | The best FREE movie channel ever! | Awesome! | There is always such good options to choose from. Whether it‚Äôs the movies available, new additions every month or the plethora of TV shows Tubi is where it‚Äôs at!!! | Amazing | Could be good used to be great but now WVERY 2-3 minutes error code 0090- something pops up. Pointless download don‚Äôt waste your time | Free üëç | Love y‚Äôall & the movies | The movies get shot when they don‚Äôt like me. | I love it | I love horror/thriller movies and they have so many good ones. You only have to watch an occasional ad. (I suggest watching the Descent, Cabin Fever and/or Escape room) | Slow slow slow | Great ! | Last 20m sound keep repeating,them u hear 2tracks at the same time | Tubi rocks! Tons of free movies and free TV shows especially if you are a B-Movie fan. Tubi also has newer modern movies as well. The absolute best free movie app! | Is better than Netflix. That is all. | Overall, I like the app. There are so many kinds of movies, and I love the choices. I do have one complaint.  In the middle of the movie, the app will start buffering, and it lasts for several minutes. Even after I‚Äôve clicked back several times, the movie still buffers. I‚Äôve even had to turn off the television and sort of reboot the TV for the app to work.
. | Much variety and choice!! | I am in love with Tubi. I love the free options and the live TV keep it up. | I love Tubi I can watch show that I watched growing up I can watch musicals n all the shows I love to watch. And it a free channel. Keep up the great work Tubi and keep bringing more shows that families can watch n Christian movies and food shows . | def one of my fav streaming apps. Tubi has a good selection of movies especially with the horror genre and i rlly like that cs with netflix or hulu they dont even have a good selection. i recommend Tubi!! üòÅ | It has  good action and it keeps you wanting for more | Wide amount of choices, but the Democratic Party will soon take your 1st Amendment right by censorship.  I and my brothers and family did not fight wars for the last 4 hundred years to see the freedom of speech, religion and our unimaginable rights to be legislated out of existence. | I want to see Moses with Charlatan Heston | Great movies!! | Keep up the good work | Oat | Long ads | yes, really !! | Cynically, for me I guess,‚Äúfree apps‚Äù are not always been equal by any sense of the imagination. This is why some apps are still pulling that ‚Äúthe old reliable‚Äù once you purchase this option, then you get the free stuff-award! However, Tubi delivers exactly what it says it will do, free entertainment from a vast variety of tv shows and movies at your fingertips that are actually free with nothing else to buy for the user! Now one can enjoy their own personal entertainment portal by using very your own phone, pad or computer to use this application! | Outstanding entertainment. | I used to love this app watched it all the time and felt like the commercials were very reasonable. That‚Äôs what said it apart is the commercials weren‚Äôt feeling like they were as much as the shows are now it looks like you watched just as many commercials it shows just like all the other ones what set this apart is what they get rid of it and I watched it for years but now there‚Äôs so many commercials it‚Äôs unwatchable uninstalling no longer faithful user. I used to watch this because I felt the commercials were very reasonable compared to other services that was its main selling point and That was the main reason I used this app so much. | Don‚Äôt know how they offer same movies as Prime charges but please don‚Äôt ever change! Only thing left in this world free! Thank you üôèüèª | This was a very interesting and exciting documentary. | You are now being SERIOUSLY disrespectful of the ‚ôøÔ∏è! I am deaf/legally blind & now when I pause it so I can read text on the screen, (like a synopsis of the film, note a character wrote) U SHOW AN AD INSTEAD OF THE PAUSED SCENE!! I am legally blind & NEED to pause to read things sometimes. Showing an ad INSTEAD of the paused scene is serious disrespect to your viewers. ü•¥ Also, now since the update, it stops midstream a lot, going straight to a blank purple screen. 1 more thing, instead of improving the ‚ÄúLeaving Soon‚Äù section like I wish you would‚Äôve, you went & took away the date (like ‚Äúleaving in 10 days‚Äù) What‚Äôs up with that?? It was bad enough you couldn‚Äôt keep the movie until midnight of the day before, yes, we had to do the math in our head, but now you went all out sketch & just remove movies whenever without any time frame. This makes it look illegal, guys. Please please PLEASE print this review. Other deaf/blind people NEED to kno we cannot pause the film to read a note, synopsis, or a text a character is sending on their phone in the tv show or movie. This is serious disrespect & I should report it to the ADA. | Love t Tubi I can watch movies | I love this app it‚Äôs so good‚Ä¶..and uh your not a og anymore I like the old background so yeah go get a life bye 1 star! Just joking or am i‚Ä¶.. | The reason I gave it one star is because I couldn‚Äôt give it zero stars. It was fine until you started with this new look. I just saw a movie that I wanted to watch, but as I scrolled back to the top, it wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Now everything seems to be horror and scary movies, which I don‚Äôt like. I even saw a thumbnail for a movie that showed a woman‚Äôs face split open with brown stuff coming out. I don‚Äôt want to see that. | Good. | PlutoTV was once fine too and now it‚Äôs not. 

So here‚Äôs Tubi! It‚Äôs got some good stuff. The streaming (both live and not live) media works very well. There‚Äôs no issues when I have to pause or start a video again, as long as the app hasn‚Äôt closed. 
If I close the app, or the mini window player on my iPad or iPhone close, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs completely lost the spot in the episode of a show I was watching. Not 100% of the time but often enough that I‚Äôm writing this in the review. 

The ads aren‚Äôt nearly as obnoxious as other free services, although some are the same ads you might see elsewhere. 

At this point, the quality of movies and shows to watch is higher here than other free services, and the app works. So really that‚Äôs what you want in a service like this, so hooray! | So good makes me want to scratch my butt so hard blood comes out of my mouth ^__^.",4.76152,623507,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/61/f8/52/61f8523e-402c-e90b-6b7c-2e63b23184d4/c2a3d010-5f86-46ea-aa6e-0e0f61815465_5.5-01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/0e/b9/96/0eb996b7-e0dd-044f-3cd1-436eeb0087cf/f225752a-c4ae-48b5-8d30-9e66455c0630_5.5-02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/9f/7e/20/9f7e20d6-4349-8a7e-0acf-4068ad608140/cd060dd7-fad0-476e-b512-e6741be02ac5_5.5-03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/8f/78/e2/8f78e212-da44-a5b7-f57c-f092eebb2ad0/52cd956f-474c-48ee-a02c-1ebf3170989c_5.5-04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/77/cf/2d/77cf2d70-8042-fb5a-ad08-bfd590c5383f/c9f0817c-f7f4-42a7-8eae-82bf9f7c6c59_Tablet-01.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/dc/d1/88/dcd188a9-4da8-5dd1-fec5-93da4f7d0ff9/637c6b37-90da-4779-9fc1-095def26abf6_Tablet-02.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/64/19/e7/6419e7f9-fcd0-d6f6-9a9f-b7e8f2597980/f8834894-aaf5-4894-a6ab-ae6957b0a4c3_Tablet-03.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/2e/9c/20/2e9c20ae-8d06-3523-f135-ccff921ff897/f924476e-5690-4d88-8125-38d7b9525dd1_Tablet-04.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

This app incorporates and helps organize Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and also PDF‚Äôs. Through this app I have become more proactive and more organized at my school and at home and at work. This app is an amazing tool and resource for anyone looking to organize and enhance their technological experiences. | Google drive is very excellent to allow sharing of larger file sizes or multiple files.

I can find all my special saves from emails, google, messages, and messenger. 

This is user friendly and easy to find what I am looking for.  

I love that I can share my important saves with my family and friends. | Good job | Demasiado | I have to execute two-step verification every time I access Google Drive on my smart phone. Then the app opens to a generic location and not the location where my hyperlink directed. Also, I can conveniently see the names of all the folders. Is that the date the folder was created or is that the date The latest file was placed in the folder?

It takes about 30 SECONDS for the app to open a link (given it‚Äôs on high speed Wi-Fi network. Slower networks make it even longer).
Overall, using the website version is much quicker and easier at this point. A shame. | I‚Äôm trying to send a simple audio file to my phone and it won‚Äôt save just keeps reading error. Also if I press save on an audio file I text myself it does t do anything. | I like the app and now I will learn how to use it. Thanks | Floating buttons block the files 3 dots menu button. The ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù + and scan buttons are terribly inconvenient to me. They only work around I‚Äôve found so far is to go through the steps of opening the document and then clicking on the menu button from inside the document.

Floating buttons usually block other elements of the UI. This is a design trend I really hope dies.

The + and scan buttons should really be part of the bottom bar if they are that important to have on display. | They literally let me accumulate photos in storage over 20 years and then one day started blocking me from accessing all of my photos and saved documents and put notices on my email account, my google photos, and my google drive saying that if I want my stuff back I have to pay to get it! That‚Äôs sooo messed up!! What a corrupt way to handle business! | Super easy to use! Easy to keep files together! | Google Drive is super easy to navigate! | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | I do | There‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs ‚Äúblowing my mind‚Äù about Good Drive, but that‚Äôs what I love about it. 
I use multiple operating systems across many different devices in my line of work, and Drive is a consistent place to store and pull information as needed wherever I‚Äôm at or trying to do. 
Virtual organization is such a hassle for a lot of people, myself included. So I know how easily things can seem overwhelming and incredibly stressful having many types of Documents, Resumes, Presentations, Media, (and countless other things), coming in from work, as well as personal life. And this has been a great way for me to easily organize and access anything in the proper way, and most importantly I feel it‚Äôs secure, and you have many options on how you would like to share anything you may have. It‚Äôs worth getting, and also worth the extra effort in making the switch from a current app or system you use to Google Drive. It‚Äôs consistent, the prices are fair and reasonable, and any ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù I have come across has been positive. Am still discovering new and possible things I am able to do on here. Keep up the great work, it‚Äôs appreciated! | Drive is my go to file storage and sharing app on iOS devices and my Windows lap top. | Muy buena aplicaci√≥n no da fallo | Doesn‚Äôt work well enough to be considered usable on IOS. Can‚Äôt select multiple files at once, most I the time newly uploaded files aren‚Äôt there for hours, downloads are slow. At least pretend you don‚Äôt make your app unusable for competing operating systems | This is a great little app, access to external storage on the go.  I‚Äôd only like to see a feature make music play in a friendlier format like adding repeat or make a playlist but it‚Äôs still a very good app. | I didn‚Äôt even know these are here !
I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre safe here
Sincerely, Monique | This app used to be great, now it barely ever loads the files, it stays in a perpetual spin. Before this it was 5 stars, now it's virtually unusable. Good luck finding support. | Great for my schooling | Tarda mucho en procesar videos cortos de 1 min √≥ menos de 100 MB, porqu√© ??? En Amazon Drive y otros es en minutos y aqui tarda varios d√≠as, la verdad no es una soluci√≥n as√≠, estar√≠a bi√©n arreglar eso | This used to be perfect. The best storage system by far. I use it for everything. Now it just loads forever. It‚Äôs a useless app on my phone. I have to use the web site on my phone browser. I might start looking for another solution. I don‚Äôt have time to fight an app that I need to just work

Edit: at the developer advice, I deleted and reinstalled the app. It‚Äôs still slow but working for now. | I can watch T&H lessons | Stop asking for revision I do one thing nice  and you start blocking my opening of my photos.  
                    I don‚Äôt have time for this.
                     Please Stop | It is a great app | Seems weird | This is one of the worst thing I have ever downloaded prosessing videos takes forever! | Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do with this Google update?

The pro version, and it is amazing for everything from Instagram images to YouTube thumbnails to you name it. Best money I spend every year. | Helps a lot with thumbnails | This app has helped me create the most eye catching content to market my small business. I love it so much, there is so many templates and examples to use that you can personally customize to your business needs. I has made my page very attractive, makes my products look professionally marketed with a few clicks of a button. I paid for the Pro because it is 1000% worth it! I even referred my sister to use this to help her build her instagram, she is a tattoo artist. Easy to use, amazing for the price, legit endless options on here you can basically create anything and you can follow certain creators to see their work and use their templates or make your own for others to use! | One of the best my choice app! | i have used canva for many things: presentations, flyers, and shirts.
canva is amazing with animations and templates. really recommend! | Canva makes my work as a blogger and gossip columnist so much easier!! Thank you | Maybe it‚Äôs me but I‚Äôve tried making YouTube videos using this app and it‚Äôs complicated I downloaded this app to help me grow my YouTube and I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding how to use it I‚Äôve been on it 3 days now and I‚Äôve tried everything I guess it‚Äôs for people who knows more about software and video creating.  It‚Äôs not self explanatory if you don‚Äôt have any knowledge about this kind of stuff it won‚Äôt work for you.  I feel people who are beginners into this you should have step by step instructions on how to use your app when trying to make templates, videos, thumbnails etc because at this point I‚Äôm frustrated and deleting the app.  

Twinkie | E muito util e me deixa em estado de FLOW nao Vejo a hora passar! Estou aprendendo muito! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉüëç | Love it | Me encanta | I give this app a 2 star rating because IT WONT OPEN I‚Äôve tried resetting my phone etc I‚Äôve tried everything at this point. Whenever I open it just is stuck on the Canva logo and I was SUPER excited to design things but now I can‚Äôt. | I paid for the yearly subscription in January. It won‚Äôt let me access to do anything on it, but it keeps asking me for the $118.99 again I have the receipt from my bank that I paid it and that it went through. You cannot reach a real person to talk to, only an automated voice message and automated emails. | BUEN√çSIMA | Who is that beautiful girl? | The UI is extremely finicky and feels thrown together so that they can just barely say they have a working app version. Canva is miserable to control without a right mouse click, so be sure to keep that in mind when working on something like an Ipad. I recommend Canva as a product, but I can‚Äôt recommend the app version, especially if you plan on using touch controls primarily as a cursor. If you can help it, the website with a proper keyboard and mouse is what you should go with unless truly in a pinch. | If you don‚Äôt have this ap you‚Äôre missing out | So, i made an account a few weeks ago and i didnt log on for a few days and then i just logged back on today and its making me make a new account, i lost all the data that i made and now i dont know what to do bc i cant make a new account, it will not let me, | When I first started using Canva it was great because it made beautiful graphics for free, but recently more pro features have been appearing and so less of the app is free ‚òπÔ∏è | The application is very beautiful, but it is missing a star because a tool was removed
SpeedPaint
I wish the application would be returned to Canva Unfortunately it has been removed
SpeedPaint | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years now. I‚Äôm a serious, paid Graphic Designer. When I began designing with this app I thought maybe the ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù was my own mere confusion. But with daily (attempted) navigation I‚Äôve realized the app design is faulty. I honestly don‚Äôt know where to begin. There is way too much going on on any given screen. It‚Äôs difficult to organize, move, and arrange projects((?)too many different project/folder sub categories!) Im losing projects among folders. I really think this app needs a makeover and different approach. Stop adding so many new features and consolidate the ones you do have. This app is a prime example of service overwhelm. I‚Äôm only using a couple features even with Canva Pro because so many of the features are just‚Ä¶ a mess. The buttons you‚Äôd expect don‚Äôt exist and the ones that do don‚Äôt do what you‚Äôd expect. there should be more obvious guidance than communicating with a robot.

Update- I CANNOT BELIEVE CANVA INTENTIONALLY LETS THE APP/SITE MALFUNCTION IN ORDER TO DO MAINTENANCE WITH NO NOTICE OR WARNING. I MAKE MY LIVING OFF USING CANVA DAILY. DOWN UNTIL 11pm? THATS AT LEAST 100$ OUT OF MY POCKET THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!! | It‚Äôs not very easy to navigate on a phone. | Good in all aspects | This is so helpful and amazing to creat on the go ‚Ä¶ I see something in the street get inspired and create on the spot‚Ä¶. 
THANKS CANVAüî•üî•üî• | Por el momento muy buena la aplicaci√≥n | Awesome! Had fun!
I‚Äôm not so creative üëçüèª | Se puede hacer muchos dise√±os | It works great , with many tools and easy to work, I love it | I love Canva a LOT here‚Äôs why

1. Canva is great to work on your video making skills
2. You can send it to your friends and family
3. Most of all you can design things to print and 

But I rated it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (4) stars because it is hard for me to do my own voice overs. | I LOVE this program! It enables me to be creative while educating! I‚Äôm thoroughly enjoying using Canva!!! XO | I use Canva for school and home! It helps me create organized slide that also are so pleasing to look at! I also use it to make collages and stuff like that at home!!!!! It‚Äôs the BEST app I‚Äôve ever downloaded!üíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíï | Its good but the subscription is not making it enjoyable but overall very useful | You‚Äôd have to pay a subscription for your image to be downloaded as transparent. üôÑ
It‚Äôs an ok app, but has gone downhill to where you‚Äôd have to pay for a lot of things. | I can only get away with making a few simple posters and simple slideshows. But when I'm intentionally working on a very important project EVERYTHING starts freezing and glitching. The audio doesn't work at the volume I would like it to be at or it just doesn't play any audio at all! It plays audio on my muted videos! It gets tedious and annoying when working on the canva app. | Canva has a lot of options to make stuff to finding a background to making designs. The only reason that I don‚Äôt rate this a 5 st‚≠êÔ∏èr is because if you want the cute stuff you have to have premium. But overall it‚Äôs a GREAT app üòô | This is the best app ever I use it for my YouTube channel and it is very seedy | The app is great but recently it hasn‚Äôt been loading I‚Äôve updated checked my internet and restarted my phone and it still won‚Äôt load. | Canva is easy to use, easy to save and use designs where I need to and totally worth the money I spend on Pro | Hi. I have used canva before and enjoyed it very much! I literally just updated it and it won‚Äôt load. It has been sitting there for 10 minutes and still the screen hasn‚Äôt changed. It will not work in my iPhone or iPad either. Please fix this. Thank you!

Ps: please respond quickly! | Canva is a wonderful app, easy to use and very intuitive. Love the designs | Bought the subscription for the entire purpose for my design to have a transparent background when I downloaded and guess what? Didn‚Äôt work, totally useless. Imagine buying a subscription for the key features to not even work. Should just have an option when creating a project to just toggle if you want a transparent background or not. Will not be using in the future for any of my designs | Great app for my business content | Seems simple to put a name with a person‚Äôs face, but not with Canva | I have done some many projects in Canva so easy to use, helps to be creative and to carry out any project you have in mind. A must have app | I just downloaded Canva and had been stuck on the screen that says Canva on it.

Using for couple of years | This app has so many things that you can buy. Honestly it‚Äôs so much better than Temu and SHEIN.

All transactions have gone smoothly and fast shipping. | Keeps crashing! Unable to purchase items. It says my code on the back of the card should be three numbers. I only entered three numbersüòí. I tried downloading it again for improvement. The only improvement is that I can use the search box that was frozen at first. Still unable to make a purchase.üò§ | Excellent | Good product with great prices | Best app fast shipping and good quality | Satisfacci√≥n maxima aqui hago todas mis compras y siempre con buenos resultados servicio al cliente es maravillozo me ayudaron mucho en una ocacion con un reembolso Aliexpress sin duda la mejor | I‚Äôm Always buying here at AliExpress | i love this hair very soft and fast shipping | Piezas baratas | Love shopping here | I love this dress | Order from here almost daily.. ü•∞ü•∞ | Love it | Super easy to navigate and find stuff , very good application. A++ | AliExpress sources there stuff from exploited Chinese factory workers but it‚Äôs really convenient | Ever since the most recent update, the app has been much more frustrating to use. A limit has been placed on wishlist items, but this limit has not been communicated to customers through a pop up window or anything. So I have essentially been disallowed from adding anything new to my wishlist, with no remedy in sight. Furthermore, the app constantly fails to load your wishlist. I will restart my phone and it will STILL say that I have no wishlist, despite me having ten sublists with hundreds of items each. The desktop version should NOT be more convenient to use than the mobile version. I love this app but I'm loving it a lot less after these foolish changes. | Love it | This app was very good. I spent $12 and got five different things that are very high-quality. | Ive ordered soooo much off of aliexpress, everytime if I want a refund aliexpress helps me get one!! I absolutely LOVVEEE buying stuff off hear, most clothing is very soft and comfortable:)) | The Cuban curb chainAnd bracelet is phenomenon a real very hard to tell the difference I compared it to another Cuban link chain I have great quality I will definitely be buying more jewelry from you guys thank you very much From Nycasper living in Miami | Although it has been more than a month, I have complained to the AliExpress customer service about an item that has not been shipped, but they have not had time to do anything about it. The customer service of this aliexpress is just like the cheap sellers on aliexpress. There is no customer protection in this app. | Of course had to fix it to my liking but very cute over all. | I was extremely impressed with how quickly my order arrived and everything was delivered in perfect condition. I will definitely recommend using your company to all my friends | Ever since Aliexpress changed from USPS too Speedx, well for most of my deliveries, most of my packages are beung stolen due to inconvinent placement of the package or because the mailmen themselves steal it, it kinda makes me want to stop ordering here until they change it back to local service, such as USPS. | About 95% of my orders have come in and not been broken or lost 
Nice toys, 
 Honestly don't get fooled by most pictures of products, | App is easy to use | Ggg | Muy bonitos vamos a ver su durabilidad | Nunca me lleg√≥, y fueron varios los paquetes que no me llegaron, el reembolso estuvo en buen tiempo, no recibe varios paquetes que compr√© con mis descuentos de bienvenida y aunque me devolvieron el dinero ahora los productos est√°n m√°s caros, que coraje üò† | Packing is great, turn around is great, items are as published. How could you have problems? The only thing I don‚Äôt understand is is when I get my order in, and go to mark off my list things don‚Äôt check out right sometime. A lot of the times I can‚Äôt review simple because I get no response. | Great app | Enjoy looking through and purchasing great deals. Thank you. | This app is in my daily usage. | All the stuff on the app right now is so cheap so if you want some affordable really high-quality stuff, I would go to AliExpress because all the stuff there is high-quality wonderful and enjoyable like if your package gets lost they have a place where you can like call over the phone
So that is why I love aliExpress | ü§úüèΩü§õüèΩ | Puedo decir que al principio no sab√≠a si confiar pero la verdad reconozco que la aplicaci√≥n es muy buena la recomiendo bastante en todos los aspectos y no dudas en utilizarla | Kinda better than Amazon tbh | So good send it fast | Great service, wonderful business and products that do what they say they will.

Or at least be able to see a percentage breakdown for the pool when clicking on a game | What a JOKE. But keep shoving Paramount Plus down our throats, meanwhile you won‚Äôt invest in 4K technology, which isn‚Äôt even the MOST advanced (8K)! Even worse, the GREEDY PIGS force you to watch an AD each time you click on their app. Absolutely deplorable corporate GREED while crapping on their customers. | I don‚Äôt know how many millions of dollars in reviews CBS buys to have a 4.7 rating in here; but every time I try to get on this App to figure out how the heck my NCAA Men‚Äôs March Madness bracket it‚Äôs going, it has week by week coverage of LAST years bracket and if I REALLY dig, it has a prompt to ‚Äúopen CBS Sports App‚Äù to follow the tournament..   WHILE IM ALREADY IN THE APP | I find CBS sports mobile app easy and quick to find the scores that interest me
A must have app for any sports enthusiast | I have to reopen the link sent to me by my friend every time to find my bracket that I‚Äôve filled out. Makes no sense! Get it together. | Whoever set up the March madness bracket lobby has never used an app before. Hard to find, ridiculously cumbersome, awful. Why make people navigate around for a Bracket lobby? Why not let people see their standings as a tab directly in the bracket. Haha it‚Äôs SO bad | Requiring people to download an app to look at a March Madness bracket is just the worst. Lazy business trying to capitalize off of an event to make people download an app they‚Äôll use 5 times. | Please make it easier to find your brackets, and when I did find my bracket, it didn‚Äôt show the teams. | Hide your March madness bracket and embed it deeply on the app.  You never use this app except for a month in March, and you realize how terrible it is. | Cannot for the life of me get the brackets to work this year. Every time I manage to navigate through the poorly designed (and never remedied) interface to find my bracket, I‚Äôm then prompted to ‚Äòopen in the app‚Äô. Of course I‚Äôm already *in the app* so not sure how to override. (Selecting this option does nothing to help.)

Have updated to no avail.

Also, there is an option to ‚Äòhide‚Äô old brackets but they still appear everywhere and I have to scroll past tons of old pools to locate my two active pools for the year. 

I‚Äôm reminded why I immediately delete the app each year after the Madness. I wish our pool runners would host on a different platform üò≠ | Great | WHY CAN‚ÄôT I PRINT MY COMPLETED BRACKET??? JJEESH. | This app is impossible to navigate.  Keeps asking to download the app you‚Äôre in and is hard to find anything. One of the worst apps I‚Äôve ever used | No other way to see my bracket from my phone. | Guys, we all have been in 1000 different pools. Why can‚Äôt I delete or hide those easily? Your app has so many of these old pools. I don‚Äôt even want to use it anymore. And why does it take me 13 clicks to get to a bracket? | I have a question for you like I am not sure what you mean about it but you can get what | great app | The only reason I download this app 3 weeks outta the year is for march madness‚Ä¶ just put a go-to the bracket button at first menu. I‚Äôm having to dig every time just to find it. Cmon now I don‚Äôt care about all the other sports news that pops up, I have other places for that. Pls fix soon | I want to open the app and hit a button on the front page that takes me to my brackets and instead I‚Äôm clicking multiple times to find it.  Worst design ever for literally the only reason the app is useful. | I cant find the NCAA bracket I filled out. Not a great ui. | Please remind me before the tournament starts next year about how incredibly awful your bracket is‚Ä¶ within the app it tells me I need to sign up for the app, when I click on my bracket within the app.  The games don‚Äôt update until I have a birthday after each game gets finished‚Ä¶ I guess maybe because this is the first year it‚Äôs been on CBS‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. | As an app product manager myself I have NO idea how this terrible UX got into production. How do you not UAT the loop of sharing a bracket pool and then creating a bracket for the pool?! That‚Äôs the main flow for gaining users especially during March madness. When I click on the shared link I‚Äôm brought to a web browser to login (even though I have the app), but once I‚Äôm logged in, it doesn‚Äôt take me to a place where I can create my bracket for the pool I was invited to! When I click the link again I‚Äôm again asked to log in on web and it‚Äôs an endless loop. PMs- read your reviews and fix this asap!! I just know there‚Äôs a dumbfounded PM out there looking at their metrics and confused why they are seeing so few brackets created in shared pools | Link points to dead link in app can‚Äôt even view my standing in groups. Fix? | The user interface on this app is poorly designed. Why is it so difficult to find my bracket for NCAA March madness?? That should be its own tab. Also way too many pop up ads. | I use this app one month a year to follow March Madness. Every year, it gets harder to find anything related to brackets. I can‚Äôt find the groups that I‚Äôm in and can‚Äôt see the brackets of people I‚Äôm competing with. Massive oversight and extremely frustrating. | Open app and can‚Äôt find My Pools or My Brackets anywhere! | Once again this year, several folks didnt get their brackets in because of how complicated it is to submit them. One person even got a confirmation, but the bracket was not there. ESPN here we come for next year! | They deleted my march madness picks and ruined my bracket zero stars | Links only open on Web, but you can only do anything from mobile. Makes you make an account and login at every step of the way and is incredibly annoying. Figure out how to open the link in the app is terrible. | Can not open entry bracket on website without using app. Can not print bracket from app. Link to entry bracket in email forces you to app. Signing in on website and selecting your bracket forces using app. No other option. Constant web page crashes. Worthless. | Cannot handle usual March madness traffic - bad app | Brackets are too complicated

Do better | I used to love this app when it worked now it just freezes up. I‚Äôve installed and uninstalled four times in the last two days and I have a brand new iPhone. | Difficult to navigate compared to Fox Sports and to move from sport to sport | Love this app, but wish you could leave or delete old bracket pools that are no longer active. It only lets you Hide/Show from view, and even then it seems to be buggy and still shows pools in your list that you‚Äôve asked to hide. Someone please fix! | ESPN is better but this is good for march madness so I will give it two stars it‚Äôs alright like | Need to fix the ads so they stop popping out after you hit the close button. | I‚Äôm only using this app for my March Madness bracket, but I‚Äôm about to throw in the towel. I can only get to the bracket from a link outside the app? | Can‚Äôt get to fill up my Ncca brackets bc the app stinks or the browser being used is not compatible. Not user friendly | Love this app for my sports information,always great information,never fake news keep it up | Do NOT use for running a March madness pool. Links shared for a pool is fairly common. CBS will make you use the app if clicking the invite link from a mobile phone. But the bracket/pool will not show up in the app. It‚Äôs impossible to fill out a bracket for a pool as a result. You will have to fill it out using a computer. Which makes this app completely useless during March. | Glad to have this device so I can see the NCAA. Or keep up with the score. | This app is so terrible for brackets. They are confusing at best to find. You cannot delete them on the app either. I have old ones from all the way back in 2017 that I don‚Äôt want but still show up. Even using the hide/show doesn‚Äôt do anything. Furthermore I got an invite from a friend with a link, follow the link, and it opens my browser instead of the app and tells me to go to the app. When I do go to the app the pool doesn‚Äôt show up. Terrible app design and very user unfriendly. Do better CBS | I think it is a great app but one huge thing is I cannot seem to sign up and can only look at scores and things like that | Need to update March madness bracket features. Currently missing the feature on main menu. 

Also need to be able to remove people from your pool as that feature is not available. | I enjoyed having a bracket so I could play with my fam. I always used to waste paper on printing out the bracket and now I don‚Äôt have to! Big save of money too. | Every basketball game I want to see is not available. App for s worthless if games are not available in my area. | This app makes me login to view games each individual time I switch from one game to another or if I click out of a game and then click back into it. It also kicks me out of viewing certain games at an uncertain amount of time. It moves me from viewing the CBSSN feed to viewing the CBSHQ feed randomly and it is very frustrating. | The app layout is unclear for creating brackets on the phone. If you want to leave a bracket for whatever reason, that can only be done on the website and not the app. That‚Äôs incredibly inconvenient.",4.71013,622714,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ef/e9/9b/efe99b72-740f-3cde-538e-f8d855effee0/1b759e18-bd5a-451f-a75e-602823567fa4_1-iPhone.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/75/52/50/755250bb-ecf1-e983-553c-7e9d5a7b6472/dbc7df5d-013e-4bee-ae74-efdaa13bcc87_2-iPhone_Pro.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3e/97/af/3e97aff3-8f1c-fdcd-dcc3-1f96264c39ec/dd6ac0e0-a734-4cbe-b6a1-25297e6c4997_3_-_Watch_Live.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9a/18/09/9a18099f-ab04-47ec-3002-1a1181ae523b/b622be05-8b19-452b-b025-1a089ada2df3_4-iPhone.jpeg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/66/cf/e0/66cfe090-6fa6-bc99-3148-0074c6aa8a21/e1c84480-803d-40b5-a7c2-74e2be2517a9_5-iPhone.jpeg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e0/f4/13/e0f41392-86f4-9d02-0957-4a012e7707c9/d551d00e-0ee1-4064-b304-9dc5f7842f66_6-iPhone.jpeg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e4/0b/9c/e40b9ca8-66ed-8c07-4305-5ae8fca39c71/35258b6a-e473-41a0-9bbd-44a01cb35d31_7-iPhone.jpeg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c6/f8/fd/c6f8fddb-6a40-7152-dfe8-47dd374b21cc/e68bfe7c-3f06-44e4-8d11-c41ce33c3adf_1-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f0/92/b4/f092b467-6d4b-d33d-e23a-a13bbbdc31e5/f472953d-449c-4b57-aac2-deaa63cfd559_2-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/55/58/b5/5558b5a0-7d8a-8486-6fd3-275102719e59/5849f389-806b-4771-a210-46dbf066f02e_3-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/80/63/16/8063166e-76f0-d464-26af-b3e174adfea3/78a91a03-a08c-4a34-b6e0-caf853121692_3-iPad__U00281_U0029.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b9/c8/4a/b9c84ac0-eb4a-2dcf-083b-8dc8b62a3baa/37611326-44b3-4840-a2f1-570c19aabac4_4-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f2/50/d5/f250d5d4-2cdd-f3d3-b1f8-3eb1aca003c1/f3d87c2d-0f1e-40bb-84f5-e72204c7139d_5-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d9/a0/fd/d9a0fdb3-bdf7-875b-f449-2bcd9dd12680/6dc99315-1f53-4643-8252-bd085469c328_6-iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen""

I like looking at homes for sale but it always shows me that the place is leased and it annoying when I ask questions or I wish it was obvious that it‚Äôs not a leased | Not easy to see at a glance if a property is under an HOA, or even if it comes with acreage- my primary criteria! | I have called multiple locations listed that all have been rented or they are not what they described in the description, the app is such a waste of time | There should be an option to customize the order of your saved homes. For example, I‚Äôd like to rank the homes I‚Äôve saved. The only way I can do this right now is if I sort by ‚Äúsaved date,‚Äù go to the home, and un-save then save again to bring it to the top of my list. Having a custom order would make returning to a home much easier, especially when trying to share. | Omg I love Zillow. It‚Äôs easy to manage.

How this isn‚Äôt developed is beyond me. | The properties that I‚Äôm looking at keep going on and off the map like every 10 seconds or so I see it for 10 seconds and then it‚Äôs off for five and then it goes back-and-forth. | The new update for Zillow mobile is not good. It‚Äôs more time-consuming to scroll through each block and then have to click more and then go back.. the original options and the way that it used to be was much more efficient and easier to use as a real estate agent my clients all agree that the new app update is difficult. | You will immediately get texts and emails from random realtors who are unaffiliated with the listing your inquiring about. | I put in an application on a house and did not hear back from landlord after multiple calls and text and now Zillow customer support won‚Äôt even answer me!!! I lost $105 for application fees and Zillow doesn‚Äôt care at all! | No tab for messages.  Duh. | Bring back the old UI.

She was patient, understanding, and extremely professional as she guided us through what was at times a stressful situation. Being helpful and timely in responding to our many questions. Densita assisted with e signing and worked to correct paperwork errors, she worked with us throughput the entire process with personality and skill.  Simply said this was the best experience we could have asked for. The two of us highly recommend her to anyone buying or selling property. Definitely the best! | About 75% of the time lot lines fail to display. This seems to have happened after the latest update.

Doesn‚Äôt change info on homes often.

This would be a good app if they didn‚Äôt update it so often. It used to be a lot better, but the UI only gets harder to use. For example, you used to be able to enter a zip code and have the area delineated and then zoom out to see houses just outside the delineated area. However, to accomplish this now, you have to do a series of non-intuitive actions. Please, just don‚Äôt update the app any more! | My phone is three years newer and far more powerful then my tablet and yet your app still will not show me the same houses in the price range I have set. Using this app on a phone is useless. | I‚Äôm frustrated because there‚Äôs no easy way to find your current messages in the Zillow app! Please add a messages tab to make it easier for us! | The new look to the down payment (amount and %) section is terrible. At least on the iPhone, you can‚Äôt see the numbers any longer. It needs to be charged back. | I paid a 35$ application fee just for the actual agent of the property I was looking at tell me that the 35$ I paid on Zillow didn‚Äôt matter and that I‚Äôm paying Zillow not them. | The zestimates for the claimed houses do not show up. You can search for any house and see the estimate range, but for the houses that are claimed by us, when we try to go to the claimed houses and click on them, the value range does not show up. Not sure what the reason is. I feel it‚Äôs a bug. Sometimes it shows up and sometimes it does not. Sometime a only the top portion shows and not the bottom portion where the actual range is specified | Can‚Äôt unsubscribe from Zillow emails. | Do not like the new update. It's much more difficult to find the information than it used to be. Seems they tried to clean the look but just made it harder to read and have to click extra buttons to extend information. Wish I could go back to the older version. Have a hard time finding what I'm looking for on individual houses | The new schools rating system is much worse than the previous version. It is not nearly as useful in evaluating an area in a new city. Far too much weight is given to equity. Which pulls down otherwise very good suburban schools to a mid level to low level grade. | Please don‚Äôt tell me i need to reconfigure my phone to upgrade the app. Find better programmers. | You don‚Äôt allow many tags to be used. I don‚Äôt what‚Äôs the big deal about the total amount of tags that you can use. | In terms of trying to list my home as a ‚Äúfor sale by owner‚Äù it‚Äôs been a huge hassle and no one calls or emails you back when you have questions. | Shows I have a active warrant! And I DO NOT! This is NOT OKAY! | Was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in selling my condo in Scotts Valley, considering the market got me the best selling price. I owe her a big favor she is an outstanding estate agent. I would highly recommend her to anyone.
Thank you, Bodie Arcarese, Psyd | The new tags on rental listings in the corner make no sense | Zillow seems to be willfully avoiding the inclusion of environmental risk scores in the app. I can only assume they aren‚Äôt included in calculating the zestimate. Home insurance companies certainly look at those risks to set insurance rates, something a home buyer would want to know. Realtor.com and Redfin both include more risk data. Realtor.com has all five: flood, wind, excessive heat, (dangerous) air quality, and fire.

Realtor.com also has a noise level indicator which is an environmental factor, but not a risk. 

Zillow is not keeping up. | Zillow should absolutely add comments to listings, it would allow people to communicate about neighborhoods and values, and help get owners to lower prices on inflated properties and help the cost of living crisis. I just saw a home in a not great part of town that is being sold for over 200k more than it was worth 6 years ago, not having a comment section is part of that problem. | Use Zillow to quickly view broad ballpark value info, school info, or tax info. But it‚Äôs not specific in its valuations, and map locations are often way, way off. Too often I click on a listing in a particular area, but the actual listing is from a completely different area. Seeing this issue more and more prevalent. I‚Äôve reported incorrect locations before but they don‚Äôt change. | It covers the bare minimum for what it does. No way to report properties that say screw with a filter intentionally by labeling square footage as acres, or not including if something has an hoa. So it covers the bare minimum in letting you know the home exists and there is a possible price | Hide 55+ communities filter does not work which are most of the listings it seems at least in my area. Good luck anyone else finding a home! | A horrible app and horrible company that sold out to the realtors, look elsewhere, we did and they have much better option ! | Year built 19
19 what?  1900 or 1999 Or somewhere in between. Makes a big difference 
Thank you for app but latest update you cannot see the year built. It will show year built and first two digits of year then you have to click on that then a pop up shows full year. WHY???   I had 6 options for quick view I tried to make it only 1 to see if full year date showed but you must choose 2 options. Even with only two options still only shows first two digits.  Please fix this to be able to see full year like you always could before this update.  So please please fix so we can see full number. | App is great, but the notifications are annoying. I have open house notifications turned off, but it still makes red circles on the app icon and notifications inside the app | Did the latest update and wish I had not. This version is more difficult to navigate, the tabs take away from the map and make the map much smaller. 
Also the sharing is more difficult as there is no text sharing only airdrop? Can I have the last version back please! Not sure who‚Äôs idea it is for such a vast change, but I think I will look for a different platform that doesn‚Äôt change all the features that I find useful. | I do not have trouble with inaccurate information on Zillow as others have stated in their reviews.  This is really based more on the way that the data is generated, collected, and distributed, and is somewhat inevitable.  My problem is that I am constantly being asked to use the app instead of my browser because it is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.  It is not necessarily better in my opinion.  Based on information shown on the app, we contacted our realtor and told them to schedule a viewing and begin putting an offer together incase the property was as we were expecting‚Ä¶ great house at a great price, had to move fast.  Our realtor went about spending his valuable time doing as we had requested.  Later when excitedly viewing the listing in my browser, my wife noticed that it was a cash only listing.  Sorry, I do not have $240k burning a hole in my pocket.  The problem is the fact that Zillow had the data to report that it was a cash only transaction, but failed to mention it in the app, only the browser.  I was embarrassed to have to tell my realtor who had spent some time on this that we were no longer interested based on what we had found on Zillow (browser) but not found on Zillow (app).  Either make the app to reflect what is in the browser, or quit telling me that ‚Äúit is better in the app‚Äù.  Great app otherwise. | they recently updated the app and put everything under a sub menu in each listing. you need to click and open a field just see info that used to be available at a glance. feels like a ploy to have you keep the app open longer. revert it back! | Zillow is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù real estate site‚Ä¶ but often the listings do not show the status of the property‚Ä¶and that leads to wasted energy.  Also, how to filter historic properties and commercial/residential properties? 
Thanks! | Zillow seems to be making these war era homes seem bigger by adding basement footage to upstairs footage to make it seem bigger, it‚Äôs misleading.. a 924 sq foot ranch home is 924 sq.feet not 1824. | I request No HOA  but houses, condos have an HOA. I don‚Äôt get it and will remove this app | The new update is so bad. It makes the phone app way less user friendly. It makes me not want to use it anymore. I may just use realtor exclusively. | I‚Äôve mostly enjoyed the app, but there is room for improvement as well. It‚Äôs annoying that hidden homes still create notifications when meeting saved search criteria. It‚Äôs also weird that they won‚Äôt allow filtering by school ranking. I can‚Äôt imagine a good reason for that.

My current complaint though is that they‚Äôve removed widget functionality in a recent update. I hope it‚Äôs just broken, but you can no longer create a widget so I believe it was removed‚Ä¶ | Customer support dont even get back to you so whatever happening with the app wrong wont be fixed | My husband and I really had a great experience with Zillow and their team. | Since yesterday the mortgage rate and rest of the zillow app widgets are not working anymore.. they are not even

I finally got sent to checkr (The company that runs Doordash's background check) and to no surprise they couldn't help me either and can only be contacted through email. Only time a support agent ever actually helped me with a situation was because I was stuck a register after shopping for a groceries for a customer who had entered an invalid proportion of meat to their order and the red card wouldn't let me complete the order. They were able to failsafe it and I was on my way to deliver the groceries but when it came to my account I was sent to a call center in India where none of the call center agent knew anything about door dashes policies, reasons for account locking, or anything that couldn't be solved with turning off/deleting the app and redownloading it/ or changing the password. | The map is slow to change whenever I need directions to the customer address.

The app knows how long previous drivers waited for the orders before from arriving to the store to confirming the food pickup and it should take into consideration when to actually assign a driver. I had 2 restaurants that took longer than 10 mins each that I had to unassign the orders because now I am wasting my time when I can be making money.

Thats a scam . We need to take this to court | Just like Uber, DoorDash doesn‚Äôt pay fair wages.  The work is not worth it because the executives who run the company pay themselves in salary and stock, but steal our fair wages.

Do you guys know How many minutes is 10 miles driving?
That‚Äôs what showed me on app today.

Nothing has worked and it has been about 4 hours since I was able to get back into my account | Since the new update and time adjustments there is no way to schedule yourself for a dash. The times are off and not even the times when breakfast, lunch, or dinner are. You can wait around to the normal times such as 11 for lunch and it never open. However to schedule a time slot is difficult the times such as 30 mins to dash is not enough to make anything furthermore the times that are always open are at midnight to early morning hours.

They constantly tell you they will send your case to the ‚Äúescalations team‚Äù with a 5-10 business day turn around. After the 10 business days they will just start telling you that there is no set time frame and they will ‚Äúget to it when they get to it‚Äù the customer support team needs major help because they don‚Äôt actually help with anything. | La verdad la aplicaci√≥n tiene mucho tiempo de espera para que le asignen un pedido duro m√°s de una hora sin que me asignen un pedido | I‚Äôve worked dozens of jobs, this is by far the worst one. You make 2$ per order from the app if you‚Äôre lucky and have to rely on customer gratuity for your main source of income. It has you wait for hours in restaurants unnecessarily and when you aren‚Äôt you‚Äôre waiting in your car. The app chews through your phones battery, and there are constant miscommunications with customers due to the apps complicated nature. Overall the worst job ever, only ever get if if the promotions are ridiculously rewarding which they are in the beginning, but don‚Äôt let them trap you, delete it immediately after the signing bonus. | App showing inaccurate miles ..while offering orders they are trapping drivers with wrong calculation

When we are accepting offers which are not the same as offer.

Very low payment for the far deliveries not even offering 1 dollar 1 miles 

Totally disappointed | The app works well. Easy to accept and carry out orders. Need to add Apple CarPlay and a way to view tax documents in the app. | New update changed the whole system to competitive ranked similar to a video game ranking system. Can‚Äôt even access the money i‚Äôve already earned until i do 25 deliveries which I can‚Äôt get any until im ranked at 50 deliveries. Before the updated the system i got 19 deliveries from 2 shifts. It took 6 more 4 - 6 hours shifts to get the remaining 6 deliveries done just so i can get the money I earned already. Clocked in one day for 6 hours and got 1 delivery. New update ruined the app. They prioritize illegal works with no plates on there mopeds. | Do not count on doordash as a job!! Waste of time. | When you get batched orders, be careful when declining them. The app will tell you your acceptance rating will drop 1%, but it actually means 1% for every order in the batch. Acceptance rating is a big factor in determining the kinds of orders you are eligible for, and support will not adjust your ratings. Also, document everything you can, support will not provide proof of anything that could help you and that‚Äôs per DoorDash policy. | Some fast food partners or individual franchises need to be dropped.  Wingstop and bojangles consistently have terrible service and speed | I enjoy working for DoorDash. My one and only issue is sending people to pick food up for a order that just started when there are other door dash orders waiting to be picked up. The app should do better generating food to where it makes sense because I‚Äôm here at a pickup watching someone‚Äôs food get cold but when I first got here they just started someone else‚Äôs order and there was an order that been finished from them . This person good is getting cold when I can grab it and they can send the person who‚Äôs obviously on there way from across town | So I just drove 3 miles to the store I was going to shop my order at to get unassigned, because the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have red card‚Äù button is so close to the phones home button. When I was switching back to the dasher app from stopping my Everlance trip, I pressed where the ‚Äústart shopping‚Äù button should be, but my finger accidentally grazed the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have red card‚Äù button on the way and the ‚Äústart shopping‚Äù button I thought I was pressing turned into an ‚Äúunassign order‚Äù button that didn‚Äôt even ask me if I was sure to give a chance to go back. It just wiped the order off my screen instantly. It would be better if the ‚Äúunassign order‚Äù button would pop up somewhere different than where the ‚Äústart shopping‚Äù button is, or if there could be another screen asking if you are sure about unassigning the order, or if it could just get rid of the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have red card‚Äù button from my app in general since it doesn‚Äôt even make sense as I have a digital doordash red card now that if I have my phone then I have it, and if I am dashing then I obviously have my phone. It would also be nice if there was somewhere in the app to leave general feedback about the app that doesn‚Äôt require a support session so there is a better place to report this type of stuff than here. | They delay paying. I have been waiting for payments for three weeks. The people who answer the support chat do not really provide any support, they act like robots that repeat the same thing. They don't give any solution and blame the bank. The bank does not have any payments received or rejected. I come to think that they want to tie you to their prepaid visa card because it must be a way for them to earn. It's just not an app I can recommend. Instacart is the best üëèüèº and Uber's customer service chat is also 10 points. DoorDash is wrong about EVERYTHING | Allow for dashers to rate their customers the way we too are rated. Were they rude, did they put in the wrong address and expect you to take it to them? Some of these orders are way too ridiculously long and out of the way for little base pay and we should be able to accept good orders from GOOD customers without being penalized. Make the ratings more fair for dashers which make up the entire business after all | App gives me literally 3 seconds to accept an order and then when the app doesn‚Äôt open in time (3 seconds) for me to accept, it‚Äôs held against me and support is less than helpful when it comes to any technical issue and it‚Äôs been this way for weeks | i was suspended without any explanation and when they unsuspended me a week later with no reasoning other than they found out i didn't breach the contract, and trying to reach them about this issue was worthless, i got no response from customer service in the app at all | just barely started dashing, was very nervous but excited about it. as soon as i started i found i enjoyed it a lil too much so i‚Äôd spend 20 hours a day on the road door dashing. after my first 60 deliveries i had my first and only mistake where i went to the wrong house and the person claimed to be the person who ordered, but wasn‚Äôt. so i talked with the original person who ordered to try to make it right, but they randomly stopped msging so i had to count my loss. after all i‚Äôm only human and we make mistakes. after that i‚Äôve dedicated myself to buying a flashlight and communicating to customers to make sure i get the right place at night and haven‚Äôt messed up any order since then. 40 more deliveries come and i earn my plat dasher, now i‚Äôm really excited to start earning more, 2 dashes later i find myself instantly deactivated. i personally thought i was doing an amazing job. 5 stars on my rating, 93% acceptance, 97% completion, 88% delivery time in my first 102 deliveries. surely one mistake with such hard work and dedication doesn‚Äôt deserve deactivation? this was like my dream job

i‚Äôve appealed already and still waiting for an answer for their reasoning. 

tldr: no matter how much effort and dedication you put into dashing they‚Äôll deactivate you without hesitation. | I live in a busy area by DFW airport. First 14 days yes had a great time then DoorDash turned my entire area Grey and took away Dash Now. My acceptance rate is 62% they want you to keep 50% which I have unbelievable game they are running | I accepted an order with a guaranteed tip of 6.5$ (already an incredibly low sum of money) when I completed the order, the customer pulled my tip and I received 4$ instead, barely covering a gallon of gas. DoorDash support did nothing to help me and essentially told me it was ‚Äúmy problem‚Äù will never drive for doordash again, it‚Äôs absurd how a million dollar company will fight me for 2$ | Good way to make money",4.70295,2434142,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/d6/ab/92/d6ab927c-c51a-4ea0-d4e9-bf6abf3f036f/8b4e3d3a-6bdd-4f84-9366-6fdc43f697da_1_1242X2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/22/f7/eb/22f7ebae-739e-25a5-784a-c363c181da77/d72c4a67-48ed-4d57-86b8-d23fe2b417ca_Dx_Evergreen_AppStore_AUS_STA_IOS_5.5_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/80/db/47/80db478f-203c-9f41-742c-0272de768536/7bade4d9-074d-41b4-8a01-657f58360827_5_1242X2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/fb/5b/b2/fb5bb2a2-c131-33d2-33b3-749db94a5ca6/962c669f-f17d-41f8-8f36-59bd2bdae309_1242x2208bb__U00283_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/03/ca/2e/03ca2efc-5a3d-8054-5390-642b5cbc2cde/0aee3af5-e1e3-45e7-b018-aafbec606720_1242x2208bb__U00282_U0029.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I have purchased a number of items and have enjoyed them and shopping for others.
Good job eBay! | I like how you can break done a category. You can search in so many ways. I like you can specify search, such as area to shop like North America. You can purchase new or used, price point, what size, auction and more. So your not looking at hundreds of options but what you are truly interested in.
Thanks ebay , Joyce | The experience was great and smooth. Some of the seller kept in contact with me and assured me if the product was good and perfect fit.üëçüèæüëçüèæ Thank You All!! | Ebay was no help at all and closed the case even though I never received the item. Buyer beware | Love looking and finding one of a kind unique items! | I seek to buy lots of vintage plates and plate sets  , hence eBay is one of the best sites to locate some very nice items in this category. | La mejor aplicaci√≥n ! Me encanta comprar por eBay, recomendado!!! Saludos desde Rep√∫blica Dominicana ‚úÖüèÜ‚òëÔ∏èüá©üá¥ | The new update screwed up the messaging system completely. Unfortunately, all they did was implement the messaging system from the website into the app. But the reason this is awful is because the system that the app was previously using is so much better. Please, PLEASE revert this. It makes zero sense for a phone application to be formatted this way. | This maintenance thing with buyers message is so annoying and I hate the new layout. Please return to original | eBay allows and promotes buyers to break every principle of a sale, from ripping cards and returning them, or buyers need their money back just because. Awful experience. Do not sell on eBay. The fees are ridiculous as well. | Found things on here that I long forgot exsisted. | Bingity
Bangity | I sold $85 pokemon card. I got $68 . So bad. | The new messaging system is way to cluttered and hard to read on mobile. Please revert it or implement a new messaging system because this one is so bad | Don‚Äôt like the people | To me it seems the quality of the products and the sellers have improved ,by that I mean in the last year an a half I may have purchased 20-30 products maybe more , I have had only one issues 
And I will say the seller answered fast and followed up ,very helpful ,I hope to resolve that small issue soon | ebay customer service is no good | Reaching customer service is not possible! With Amazon, I can speak with a representative via phone. | Apparently at some point eBay decided to eliminate customer service, maybe someone can tell my when. Anyway, if your problem isn‚Äôt one of the few options provided to click on, you‚Äôre done. You will no longer be able to get a human on the phone, I tried but the system eventually just hangs up on you. And even if your problem IS one of the options shown, but you need further help, not gonna happen.  You‚Äôll  advised to go to a kind of FAQ page. 
   Did you know they used to have great customer service? But apparently their only concern now is how to squeeze every penny out of us. | Their is a error that is preventing the sending of messages can you please fix it | excellent in customer service and Ken is very helpful and knowledgeable in solving the issue . | I am a seller on EBay since Oct last year. So we have a year under our belts. So far so good! Thank you for all you do! I would like to know how to get a hold of eBay by phone? Thanks | Chihuahua way | Got scammed and I can‚Äôt even call eBay to explain. Lost $675! Someone stole my phone. Don‚Äôt ever sell on eBay! I‚Äôve been a seller since 2005 and I‚Äôve never been treated so poorly. | Trying to arrange local pick up. I send message and it says it‚Äôs disabled. What kind of app allows no communication? | I really hate that I can no longer look at full size pictures in product descriptions.  This has ruined an otherwise excellent place to make purchases.  BRING BACK FULL SIZE PICS!!! | Saved searches no long show new results over the past week. The symbol for new searches will show but the results show everything. | I can‚Äôt check in. Attempts at creating a new password have failed. | I received this on time but it‚Äôs damaged. | Prices keep changing photos keep disappearing and coming back and message thread keeps switching from regular to classic view. Crazy but something is definitely wrong. | The prices are way to high for the people to buy anything. | I get offer on everything that I see I don‚Äôt need all those emails when I buy something they try and sell me another one when I don‚Äôt have but one car don‚Äôt need that one part | I‚Äôve gotten some really great deals on eBay. I‚Äôve been using the app for a long time and will definitely continue | It‚Äôs really annoying because every. Time. I close out of the app it logs me out!!!! It never did that before!! | The most stupid app I‚Äôve never used. Customer service keeps asking me the registered name for verification, then where can I see this info on the app? Don‚Äôt get it why register name is matter, why not send a realtime msg or email for verification? Isn‚Äôt more secure?

The customer service is a lier. First time told me once I return the products, contact eBay again so we can issue a refund. Then once I return the products, the customer said u need to contact seller for refund not us. Is that professional? What a stupid company | Amazon has everything at half the cost plus free shipping | I am suspended of my account for no reason | I‚Äôm having so much difficulty finding out what or how to return an item that I purchased.

It should not be this difficult. | I am longtime customer. Always beautiful beautiful beautiful Ebay. Ebay awesome | Items not appearing when searching solds. Have to go to the browser to look up what something sold for. Prices being changed in the listing when selling without my knowledge or permission.

List at your own risk. | I‚Äôve always used the EBay app ! It‚Äôs great and easy to use !!! | They conduct unfair practices, by allowing potential buyers to use a feature called, ""automatic bidding"". This practice allows a potential buyer basically to set their price. And when you bid, if it's not higher than theirs, eBay who bids on their behalf, outbids you every time. eBay is a SCAM! Why would you want to do business with a company that is bidding on behalf of another potential buyer, even if you exceed the price they're willing to pay up to. I'm done with eBay. Go scam someone else. | Sends my messages and deletes others out of random. I will be in one chat texting a seller and for some reason it will send the message in the chat that I am currently in, to a whole other seller that I didn‚Äôt send a message to.. | This seller was fantastic! He was reasonable. He dropped the price for me a little bit. He was polite, and the wrapping was stupendous! He took a lot of time to do everything absolutely perfect so you can trust this vendor for sure! Thank you for a good experience.
From Sherrie | The tracking isn‚Äôt even working my stuff just randomly shows up days after the expected delivery date | I enjoy eBay app very much. I‚Äôve been a customer and a seller for the longest time . one quick recommendation : if somebody is interested in buying my item and if I want to send them an offer, I should have the ability to identify the buyers profile before sending the offer. In other words how many purchases or selling did the person had done?  what is the feedback from other transactions and more. I don‚Äôt want to sell my product to somebody who would not pay me immediately.

Thank you | Buyers can mess with your auctions however they want. Want to figure out a reserve price/maximum bid? Scare off other bidders? Place whatever bid you want, a completely unrealistically high one, then retract it days later. Want to torpedo an auction? Bid it up as high as you‚Äôd like then say you don‚Äôt want to pay. There‚Äôs no option to leave negative feedback, all of this is within eBay‚Äôs TOS.

Updated the app and it doesn‚Äôt pull my account. Going to the profile just has an empty window with the button ‚ÄúGot It‚Äù. 
Obviously the devs don‚Äôt got it. Useless app now. 
Won‚Äôt complete the update download and before the update, failed all Apple Pay transactions. A week later and the app doesn‚Äôt load or connect to servers. Can‚Äôt see my account and can‚Äôt order. Other apps work fine. | It‚Äôs great you can get rewarded from purchases. I would suggest that the redemption process be  simpler than just using the app. For example if you‚Äôre ordering in store, scan or enter info into computer to redeem rewards. | Really makes you think, huh? $2 more for a chicken quesadilla in 2024. | Even though they ask for sauces in the app and even though they give you the bag closed with a sticker with a printed list of items inside including sauces, they do not include them. | Title says it all. I am fine with being petty about this. Bring back the Fiesta Veggie Burrito!!!! | The app has worked (mostly) fine for me for years, but since the most recent update, it won‚Äôt do a thing! Won‚Äôt let me log in, won‚Äôt find any nearby restaurants‚Äîforget about ordering, the menu‚Äôs not even loading! I completely missed the early access period for the Cantina Chicken, all because the app won‚Äôt do a thing. I‚Äôve deleted the app, restarted my phone, and redownloaded it multiple times. Completely broken. | Recently this app started ‚Äúglitching‚Äù by refusing to accept any payment via Apple Pay. It appears to be an intermittent problem and I can‚Äôt find a pattern to it, but there is no ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù available to help. 

I have tried bypassing it by purchasing a gift card, but the app still refuses to accept even a gift card as payment, first off it took a dozen tedious attempts to get the gift card in at all, and eventually it just went back to ‚Äúsomething went wrong.‚Äù

When the app is working correctly, it will still randomly stop your music when you open the app, then stop it again when you complete a purchase so that it can play an annoying sound effect. There is zero justification for this. But I persist in putting up with it because there are often decent deals in the app. | Everytime I go through a place a custom order, i get to the pay screen and my order is somehow always changed to a mexican pizza combo. This is the weirdest glitch and I don‚Äôt understand it, it‚Äôs not a big deal just very annoying to use the app. | If you order ahead with the app and the store is out of the ingredients needed, they can‚Äôt cancel the order and neither can you through the app if they processed it without thinking. Customer service doesn‚Äôt answer either, so you‚Äôre just out your money. | Ordered delivery. 
Paid but never received my food. Door dash was helpful but could not do anything because Taco Bell had no idea what they are doing. 
The app is pointless as it won‚Äôt give you the info you need and doesn‚Äôt work or just won‚Äôt load the info you do need. | My food was never delivered and it doesn‚Äôt allow me to track my order it took my money | Every time I open the app the badge icon number increases. 

Interesting bug. Intentional? Lol | The new updates are terrible now Used to be able to find my location at any Taco Bell and now I gotta search for it and apple pay won‚Äôt work anymore ‚Ä¶ time for a new place of fast food like Carl‚Äôs Jr | Story of this app‚Äôs life | Terrible App and they always seem to screw up the promo code drops | Drop Tuesdays are a disaster. 
Orders fail. 
Says doesn‚Äôt have right item.  
Something went wrong. 
Please pay for the right IT staff to create a winning mobile app. 
Someone is cutting corners. | Don‚Äôt even think about using the app from 4pm-4:30pm pacific time on a Tuesday. It‚Äôs the $1 drop slot and it will continue to crash over and over again even if you‚Äôre not trying to get the $1 deal. Taco Bell should fix this. Other than that, no complaints. | App hardly works, which is disappointing because I frequently order here. Been like this for months on multiple devices. Checking out and using promo codes for their ‚Äúdrops‚Äù is a joke. Trying to use Apple Pay while it loads for 10+ minutes and having to close and re-open the app several times before working makes it too much of a hassle. All these bugs need fixed asap | Quite possibly the worst food app I‚Äôve ever attempted to use. I get the notification ‚ÄúUh-oh‚Äù nearly every time I use this app, and/or the spinning wheel of death if I finally make it to the checkout page. It won‚Äôt accept Apple Pay, and it won‚Äôt accept my credit card. My credit card app is a mess with canceled transactions, and sometimes it‚Äôll process them so I‚Äôm just paying for nothing. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse: the app or the fact that I keep trying to order from it. Trying to use this app has probably taken years off my life. STEAR CLEAR unless you‚Äôre looking for a world of hurt. Also, customer service has never once responded to my inquiries of how I can be successful, so this review is a complete waste of my time. Sorry y'all but I just really needed to vent. Worst. App. Ever. | App won‚Äôt load rewards | Wasted my time | Ordered the advertised Tuesday Drop item (Nacho Bell Grande) and when checking out error message shows ‚ÄúYour Cart does not contain qualifying item‚Äù Horrible non transaction and false advertising!!! | App didn‚Äôt let you place a order for pickup | It keeps changing my address to a random address three streets over there‚Äôs no way to use it. It literally won‚Äôt let me put my own address in DoorDash gets it fine McDonald‚Äôs app is fine please Taco Bell fix your app. | Taco bell so good grilled cheese burrito and cheesy gordita crunch easily top two itemsüòã | Never got the email to log in. Missed two taco nights so far. Now app has even forgot my email address. Are you trying to lose customers? Quit changing stuff that works. Tired of having to go though various kinds of logging in and having to look up which email address is for your app every time you decide to do yet another change. | ""Invalid payment method"" returned for every card, including debit card, on the day my rewards are expiring. None are declined/overdrawn/etc anywhere else, including debit card with plenty in the bank. | It just pops up a blank screen. Drove all the way out to Taco Bell and the app just blanks. Very frustrating. I hate these apps. | It‚Äôs stupid that they stop breakfast in the app early. For me it‚Äôs about to be 11 am and they are already closed. Some people are barley starting to wake up right now so why don‚Äôt you close breakfast by 12 its still considered morning so Taco Bell needs to change that because it‚Äôs most annoying. The app itself is great and gives you many options to a good menu. The breakfast timing though is very stupid and should reconsider it. | I‚Äôm not buying any more.  What a ripoff. 
Barely anything in them and only a half of a quesadilla. Not a full circle. | I‚Äôm a fan of getting points/rewards for purchases on several different platforms/apps. Taco Bell takes the prize for the least time taken to completely delete the app from my devices. In less than one day, I received soooo many ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù that it became cumbersome immediately. I placed one order that first day, for a grand total of $1.27, and proceeded to receive notification after notification after notification after notification about irrelevant stuff that had nothing to do with me, my order, or my account.
I ate the free taco, and deleted the garbage app afterward. I would advise you to do exactly the same. | Everytime I place an order, it never goes through. There‚Äôs always an error. I have enough money on my card and the store is open. It makes no sense. I love Taco Bell though | keep on trying to place a delivery order, but keep on getting a pop up that says ‚Äúorder cancelled‚Äù. i just wanted taco bell man but now i have to order food from somewhere else :/ | The app is very unstable I didn‚Äôt receive my order but they said it was delivered as far as where it was delivered I don‚Äôt know and when I try to see on the app everything is an dead end I will not be using the app again I would just like my money back and it is 1/2 a star | The person who delivered my food ate most of my order so we didn‚Äôt get to eat our food so my son didn‚Äôt get his meal my wheelchair bound husband didn‚Äôt get his meal and I didn‚Äôt get mine bc the delivery guy and his son eat our food | I can never pay with my gift card or my cash app card through the app! Emailed customer service and no response‚Ä¶ | Love the options that the app gives but the partnership with DoorDash doesn‚Äôt work.  Our order was with the driver for 45 minutes before it got to us.  You are better off using whatever delivery app you typically use.  You‚Äôll have a faster delivery or at least the option for that. | App seems to work fine but I hate that you can‚Äôt define which notifications you receive; it‚Äôs either none or all of them. Want to be able to get notifications about your order but not random promotions? Too bad. | Thanks for an update that still doesn‚Äôt work! | Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I use the Taco Bell app somewhat regularly. And while it‚Äôs not the best fast food out there, it is tasty and mostly to my liking. 

I have an issue with this latest release, showing large numbers of ‚ÄúAlerts‚Äú on the home screen icon. One day it said 15 so I opened the app, checked everywhere. (never did see anything that showed 15 notifications), close it out‚Ä¶ And it was down to nine. I left it alone. The next day, it was three‚Ä¶ And the following day was 11. What the actual heck? | It would be less work to say what the app does well. Whether it‚Äôs payment or location or even loading the menu, it screws up constantly. I can accrue points with my phone number in store, but can‚Äôt cash them in because the garbage app never works properly. | Anyone else find it ridiculous that a bag of a few chips and a small cup of nacho cheese is the same price as a burrito? I love Taco Bell but at this point the only reason I go there occasionally is because of the box. | They‚Äôre always on top of things and when I accidentally ordered to the wrong address and they refunded and AND gave me a reward!!! | I didn't wait 4 years for Californians and their high prices way out here in the plains to finally let us get our taco bell back JUST to not be able to use or order taco bell unless it's in the building. no delivery. no app ordering. and I was advised by relatives to order using the app because in person was not efficient with the computers for ordering.... | I quite literally am unable to add a payment method because everytime I go to add a payment method it doesn‚Äôt do anything and I genuinely think it is just because I‚Äôm on a iPhone and if it‚Äôs not that then the app is currently bugged. I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining if I could use the app but the app doesn‚Äôt function so it deserves 1 star | Password-less
But have to use email
Have to have access to email | The food is okay, all being the portions are small but your app dev team can work on the app. The text to screen ratio is wrong and the rewards don‚Äôt update or show like it‚Äôs glitched after ordering. Also the fees are high . $6 with delivery plus other fees you‚Äôll end up paying an additional $10-20 dollars. Thanks Taco Bell. | As it currently stands, this app is unusable. When you go to pay, it will give you an error every single time.  Good funüôÑ | This pregnant woman is craving some some warm Taco Bell food, 
Why does this Taco Bell app always choose the furthest Taco Bell location and not the one nearest to my address üò≠

I just wanted to test it out , HORRIBLE, whoever made this stop making the app ask me for VERIFICATION. OMG THE WORST , NEVER GET IF YOU DONT LIKE GETTI MG ANNOYED, UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | The video conferencing itself is a wonderful resource. Subscription management and add ons are woefully archaic. If the subscription is purchased through the App Store rather than the zoom site itself, add-ons and subscription management are inaccessible until the subscription itself expires, regardless if the subscription is canceled to purchase anew with desired features. These inflexible and unaccommodating features need to be reevaluated and updated by both zoom and apple. | It‚Äôs easy to access and the picture quality is good.

This is very annoying, you have to fix it | There‚Äôs no clear setting on how to change your display name. Plenty of ‚Äúsettings‚Äù but not even ONE OPTION to help change my name during a meeting. Spent around 15 minutes looking for a guide and NOTHING. Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so difficult. Had to resort to joining through my browser because there is no clear setting for this. Very disappointing | You can NOT do business without the prowess of ZOOM! | It‚Äôs the best option | I love Zoom on my iphone but on my iMac not so much. There are always glitches when I am on my computer but never on my phone. | Enjoyed | Such a great platform!! | I must manually type in my e-mail for every meeting, including reconnecting. If only zoom could be installed on a device with alternate login options or that could remember my e-mail address and simplify entry‚Ä¶.oh, wait. 

I avoid zoom meetings for this reason and never reconnect if it asks for my e-mail address again.

I live alone and having a little security camera makes me feel a little safer. My property manager isn‚Äôt fixing an issue where one of the windows with one of the doors to my building is broken, and it‚Äôs in a position where someone could easily reach in and just open the door. It‚Äôs a security risk, and their response for weeks now is that they‚Äôre working on it. Not having any luck getting them to take care of the security issue, I went ahead and purchased a security camera for myself. 

So far, so good. The camera works well, and the app made setup a breeze. Plus, it works well to send me notices any time it sees a person.

I read a lot of reviews before making my purchase and am glad I chose Ring! | Privacy zones need to be more adjustable like the motion zones. The stick up cameras, plug-in 3rd gen., plus the doorbell cameras used to get a blank screen every time a video started to record. It lasted just a second, but every video was like that. This issue has been fixed, however, now every video on just the stick up cameras ends with ‚ÄòThis footage is unavailable.‚Äù | Basically you pay for a camera you can‚Äôt use, usefully,  unless you pay monthly ,got it ,what a scam no wonder Amazon brands are beating you | I hate being forced to update my Ring app.  There is a difference between making changes that constitute improvements and the changes Ring makes that almost always make things worse. | The auto responses are too slow to respond to a ring or motion. Also the delay between when a person is detected and when I can access the speaker function is greater than 30 seconds, by the time I can verbally respond the individual disappear from view. | I can‚Äôt tell you how long I have had my ring. I love it but recently it has stopped chiming in on my phone.  It works on husbands iPad but not my phone. Very frustrating since I am the main person home. | Please update the iOS app to allow history filtering and edit/delete by date. I see on the website, but not the app, which is the preferred tool for reviewing events. Thanks! | 20 seconds after installing and opening this app, I'm presented with nothing but harassing messages telling me to buy other ring products and services. I get them on the dashboard and the whats new page. I bought the most expensive doorbell, so you think they'd be appreciative, but harass me to buy more before even using the product. I also get this orange banner telling me my trial is expiring. If I click the close button on the banner, it immediately comes back as I'm navigating through the app. Before my previous review was deleted for, some reason, I got a response from the developer, which stated the orange banner will go away after the 30 trial ends. This is a joke. The banner is still there, but with a different message. The message now says my videos aren't being saved and wants me to purchase a ring protect plan. The video quality is not that great either. It says HDR, which is turned on, but the video is blurry and pixelated. You think with the most expensive doorbell, I'd have a much better experience, but nope. I wish I never bought this thing.

UPDATE 3/22/2024: motion snooze was removed, which was very useful feature. | It never came back and customer support couldn‚Äôt even help. Garbage. | I‚Äôve had occasional problems but for the most part they are great! BTW‚Ä¶South Beach Jeff and anyone else that may think irregardless is a word‚Ä¶it‚Äôs NOT! Please don‚Äôt use it, it‚Äôs so annoying to read stupidity! | Why are the alerts delayed by so much time ? Is there away to fix this in the settings? Otherwise the app works great. I have a battery doorbell plus. | After the update, the alert on my ring went back to default. I tried changing it and it still wouldn‚Äôt update to newly set tones using the app. Please fix it. | UPDATE: As of 03/20/2024; I PM‚Äôd as developers response requested & surprise, surprise‚Ä¶NO ONE HAS RESPONDED TO MY MESSAGE!!!! This is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst customer service & support, or more accurately‚Ä¶lack of support from any company!! My cameras & APP are still damaged because of Rings APP update & they refuse to take any responsibility or acknowledgement that they caused damage. There are several reviews that state the same problems & issues after update so this is not an isolated incident. I am following through with reporting Ring to appropriate entities to investigate them & may start looking into some kind of class action lawsuit against them. On 3/5/2024, Ring APP updated software & since that update I have had nothing but issues & problems with 2 floodlight cams & the APP. I called Ring support on 3/6/2024, in the morning, when I discovered problems with my front garage/driveway camera & APP & after going through a series of instructions to troubleshoot, problems were not resolved. I was told they would send request & copy of my video showing the issues for review & I would get an email with their decision. I later received an email telling me my camera is past 1 year warranty so all they would do is offer a discount to purchase a new one. Later in the day, I decided to check my back patio floodlight camera & discovered it has the exact same problem & issues as the front camera does. I called Ring support again & now informed them I have a problem with both my cameras & now realize these problems & issues started after their software update hours prior. Again, I‚Äôm told they will forward request & issues described & I would get an email or call from someone at Ring & as of today, 3/8/2024, I have received neither. I am extremely disappointed & discouraged with both the service, responses & products. There are several different companies who sell basically, the identical products to choose from, I will not be using a discount offered to purchase another camera from Ring, giving them more money, when they created & caused the problem & malfunction due to their software update. This is not a coincidence that 2 different floodlight cams began malfunctioning on the exact same date & time right after Ring updated their software. The APP is also malfunctioning it is pixelated, blurry, is freezing, the quality of the video & images are poor, it starts to play as if your fast forwarding, it‚Äôs not capturing all motion so nothing gets recorded & the Neighbors community feed is not coming through or uploading all new feeds. My cameras & APP were functioning fine & without any problems or issues until this software update. Again, this is no coincidence that right after this update was performed, both my cameras are having the exact same issues & problems, as well as the APP itself, on the exact same day. I will not be forced to purchase any other cameras from Ring, even at a discount they are offering because Ring & it‚Äôs software is the cause of my cameras no longer working properly. How do they explain the APP malfunctions?? If Ring does not do the honest, honorable & correct thing here, I will purchase products from their competitors & will make sure to alert & notify ALL the proper entities necessary, including social media & news. This is unacceptable to us consumers & I do not feel at all valued as a consumer/customer. | I‚Äôve had people coming into my home without the ring going off I have 3 two outside and one inside so tell me why it didn‚Äôt capture my son coming in or being in my home on 3 different occasions not to mention it doesn‚Äôt capture me sometimes coming or going. I don‚Äôt recommend Ring anymore to keep you and your family safe. And I do have all my settings set to pick up everything even the cars in the road | After the last update I can‚Äôt change my alert sound.. so I keep getting that obnoxious chimes sound | My ring doesn‚Äôt hear my voice! And its a brand spanking new one!! Tried everything! | Never been able to speak through camera. No one can hear me, AND, I can‚Äôt hear them. The microphone has never ever worked with way. It‚Äôs my only disappointment with this. | Would be cool to when theirs motion notification that in the notification the video would play for a couple of seconds | I have had Ring for at least 3 years. Everything worked fine until this recent update. Constant glitches in video playback.
There are no changes to my Wi-Fi placement or speed so I know it‚Äôs a Ring problem. Sure hope you fix it soon. | Dont waste money on this!!! It‚Äôs hard to connect to the internet always says Unable to join network even I both mesh wifi!!! | I went overseas and was hoping to keep an eye on my house because according to Ring, ALWAYS HOME, claim, I thought I could do that but I couldn‚Äôt using my cellular service. I have 5G and trying to load live events from the app did not work at all and I was never able to access any live videos using the app nor look at history events neither. So it looks like I wasn‚Äôt ALWAYS HOME!!! I wasn‚Äôt happy at all and more worried about not being able to see what was going on at HOME! And don‚Äôt try and blame my service provider either because that‚Äôs what your techs try to do. | Thing is super slow when it‚Äôs loading a live stream, save your money and use NEST instead. | It should be a widget or something or a separate dashboard app. I said that user can quickly arm or disarm the alarm system by accidentally I accidentally shut off the alarm open up the Ring app. The current state was several dialogues deep inside inside the app when I really just want to be on the dashboard and set it to disarm, I live in an SRO my neighbors are very close by and I don‚Äôt want to disturb them unless it really really is a break-in or something else another thing another thing you should keep in mind is that there are 30,000 San Franciscans who live in Sro hotels that‚Äôs a small minority percentage wise San Francisco population getting close to 900,000 but it‚Äôs still a lot of people and it‚Äôs a market. I think Security really needs to expect to make a lot of money off this market because of them poor Security that‚Äôs offered in the buildings. I was actually going to get ADT security after I went to. I went to Lowe‚Äôs to get the ring security system is about a year and a half ago I checked I checked on the web to make sure that Lowe‚Äôs had the Ring product in stock at the Lowe‚Äôs in San Diego I mean in San Francisco I went all the way out there to Lowe‚Äôs to get it. I couldn‚Äôt find it on the shelf. I went to the manager asked her look it up on the computer and what she didn‚Äôt. She told me I had to go to all all the way to Daly city to get it because I wasn‚Äôt I was gonna go with ADT 80 website I submitted a form, requesting more information and to be contacted by them. The sales people were calling me calling me calling me but I couldn‚Äôt I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt have time to talk to them when I finally did to talk to him, I was very enthusiastic and they told me that that is too small and I was going to buy their product but what happened was after I talked to the sales person for like a half an hour just mysteriously dropped. I looked at my phone bars and I had I had full reception five bars didn‚Äôt look like it was dropped because of them on my end, because I never, I didn‚Äôt hear back from anybody from after that when they had been calling me before before they thought they had time to speak with me I came to collusion that that they hung up on me on purpose cause they didn‚Äôt think I was worth having as a customer at the first row I lived at a long time ago. They didn‚Äôt have security cameras in the hallways even and I had just a few months over $11,000 worth of of electronics stolen ring they should be wanting to support people live in ER market you really don‚Äôt want to neglect, another reason why I wanted to get the security system because I wanted to have the monitoring that they provide because I‚Äôm I‚Äôm just I‚Äôm a person by myself I don‚Äôt have anybody watching my back team like a paranoid paranoid concern but when the problems with with living by yourself is it, and in a place where people could be breaking in even even with a key yeah you have to really be concerned about being spy cameras in your own home, spy, cameras, and being able to possibly shoulder surf your your pin number on your security alarm system this is something else you should think about this as how to provide security for people if the lock on the door can‚Äôt be trusted | I downloaded the app and followed the instructions but it keeps saying that it cannot verify the CAPTCHA. I can log in on any other devices but just not the phone app. When I contacted support all I got was a dumb robot that was unfamiliar with sarcasm. | The ring is delayed and I don‚Äôt like that. This should not be happening to your customers. | Ring is garbage. I tried to share a video of someone breaking into my car so others would be aware but ring declines your post if you describe the person‚Äôs appearance. What‚Äôs the point if you‚Äôre more concerned with protecting the criminal. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend using ring system. Find another company that values you over the criminal. | It works good to let me know when anybody is leaving my home. it lacks the ability to tell me when someone is walking up my driveway or up to my house, but it will tell me when they‚Äôre leaving. Otherwise, I would‚Äôve given it five stars. | When I first got my cameras and downloaded the Ring app, everything seem to work really well. I could view any of my cameras, see my live views, got plenty of notifications, etc. over time however, the app has become less and less reliable. In fact, at this point, 5.7 0.0 doesn't even work at all. I can't even sign in. When I try to sign in, it just opens a page that says ""406 not acceptable"" the only reason I had to sign in was because I had to reinstall the app, because I cannot view video on the app at all. I get constant motion detection notifications, but I cannot view any of the videos, and I cannot view the live view. It works perfectly fine on my desktop. All my cameras are working, they all have current firmware. They are properly connected to my Internet. it appears that it is just the app that does not want to work. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times, sometimes it installs fine and basic functions work like being able to sign in, while other functions continue to not work, like viewing video. When I cannot view the video I attempt to reinstall, and get an app that won't even sign in. I am getting rid of all my dysfunctional Ring equipment and getting a better system. would not recommend the ring system. | I purchased this due to a package that was stolen from me because I live in an apartment but although that I like it it has flaws it doesn‚Äôt catch all the motions and it has a delay that I‚Äôm concerned about‚Ä¶..my daughter came to visit it captured her coming in but it didn‚Äôt capture her leaving this is very concerning to me I have only had the camera for 2 months I just wish it would be more accurate I don‚Äôt want to have another package stolen | Have 3 solar panels only 2 work Ring won‚Äôt replace it but I can buy a new one not a good company for warranties | I have waited a few years before i decided to leave a review. 

I have three homes wired with ring, each has multiple devices as well as an alarm system, also pay for the yearly monitoring and storage. 

The good:
1. Ability to monitor each location and review as needed. 
2. Have one system across multiple locations and control in one application.
3. Battery life is decent if notifications are set to economy. 

The Bad:
1. Irregardless of manual or auto settings the notifications are haphazard and many events are either lost or grabbed randomly. 

2.  Units do not seem to be upgradable so you are stuck with the generation you get. Mine are earlier so suffer greatly in video quality compared to newer versions or other companies. 

3.  Application is buggy. Mine has me set on a schedule for a camera that has never had one and everytime i try and remove it no go. Frustrating. 

4.  You must pay for storage for each property. If you have multiple properties you are stuck buying multiple plans. There should be some type of volume discount to help and entice loyal users. 

Be it one month, one year or several years My decision will be coming. Do i stay or leave for a cheaper and apparently similar product of the many that exist these days. Stay tuned‚Ä¶.. | I wasn‚Äôt able to get a subscription due to Ring‚Äôs incompetence, so all I get is notifications when someone rings my doorbell. Got one today. But I had to sign in, solve a puzzle, enter my Authenticator code only to get to a setup screen. The doorbell that notified me is no longer set up!? I‚Äôll never know who rang my doorbell, and that doesn‚Äôt make sense when there is a camera next to my door.

They say it‚Äôs the wrong account, but I have only one account. I don‚Äôt have any other credentials to use. Support is on Facebook, but I‚Äôm not and don‚Äôt intend to ever join. | Of all the notifications you can choose, none will play but the default wind chimes.  They broke that functionality in January and seem like they either don‚Äôt notice or are unable to fix it.  Either way I‚Äôm about to cancel service and purchase a competitors equipment.

Complete incompetence | Can‚Äôt sign into the app and enter my password. I get an error saying ‚ÄúWe could not verify your CAPTCHA. Please try again‚Äù. The Sign In button is grayed out | Love this it‚Äôs great works very good | I own 3 Ring cameras.  1st generation works perfectly.  Ring 2 - never loads.  Says check WiFi but also shows WiFi connected in Device Setting.  Obviously, a programming issue.  It‚Äôs a real pain because these Cameras are 4 hours drive away.  Don‚Äôt waist your money. | The notifications setting dont really work as they are supposed to when you set a perimeter of the area you watch the motion setting to go off of. Furthermore, I always get notifications when I‚Äôm entering my door but the one time a random homeless guy came to my porch and flailed around, the ring camera didn‚Äôt even notify me. What a joke. He literally was in front of the camera for for more than twenty minutes. | Reading through the reviews i noticed a pattern.legitimate negative reviews are replied to by ring with ‚Äúit can be frustrating please contact ring.‚Äùlike they‚Äôre reading a Q card. Next, The fix from ring,‚Äùit‚Äôs your internet connection.‚ÄùUMM,NO,Not if the issue started seconds after the update. Now reading through the reviews it seems ring has just started ignoring the people. I‚Äôm curious why ring would knowingly put out a bad update and not address it. Apps can usually be fixed in a day or so or worse case just roll back to the previous version. where are we going with this ring? If I have to guess,I‚Äôd say your making a new app that‚Äôs intended for a new camera that‚Äôs not known to the public yet. You‚Äôre going to sell off everything in stock to pay off the share holders and then tell us are cameras are outdated and not compatible with the new app.Then Bam! the new cameras will be on the store shelves in 2025. This is the same year our cameras software warranty runs out.To everyone, our cameras have a software in them that does not update.Rings fine print states our cameras software will be compatible to 2025.I think it‚Äôs on ring .com under device health.This is not part of our warranty or subscription. | Unable to login to my account via ring app.

The neighbors app has the ‚Äútrouble signing in link‚Äù and that works but somehow on this ring app it doesn‚Äôt have it. Please help with getting me back in my account and ring app via the iPhone thanks. | . | AppStore | So I did a review and go figure it was deleted so I won‚Äôt even give them the benefit of the doubt and write it again. Company is a joke since they sold it to amazon! Neighborhood is terrible! Just save your money and go get wyze no wonder why people are switching and now I‚Äôm looking into them. | Simple to use , gets the home security done . 
Slowly I have added more and more and now I have 3 ring cameras and 8 sensors and motion detectors | Ring keeps extending the neighbors feature to social media like information that isn‚Äôt relevant to security, and doesn‚Äôt apply the filters for security focus. Also keeps raising the subscription prices. Camera and cloud service is very good -hello. I have one camera that continues to light up even when disabled for motion - Ring has this as a feature -so I have to turn off the circuit rather than just disable the motion. | When I got this I thought that it would alarm right as someone or something came to the door. But when I rang the doorbell to my house the app didn‚Äôt even notify me till 5 seconds later | Need this feature added. Why are there no time stamps in videos downloaded from the app. Need this for court. | This app was fine for months. It now won‚Äôt let me pay to continue services due to errors and logs me off unprompted, which is really annoying to deal with. I feel like Ring is a big enough company that they shouldn‚Äôt have all these issues. 

I‚Äôm considering going with a competitor since nothing by Ring is working and some of my stuff by their competitors has never given me these problems. | Just updated because the app wouldn‚Äôt work without the update. Now the motion tone has reverted back to the chime jingles and it won‚Äôt use the setting in the app. Just another reason to hate this app. Also, they need to stop with the alert badges that require you to go in and view their ads to clear the badge. Infuriating. They just raised storage prices and pushed an update that doesn‚Äôt work. I really hate this company. Be glad when some legit competition comes along or Ring starts testing their apps and listening to their customers. | Screw you ring for deleting my review | For about a week or so, on both my Apple devices the Ring notification settings for each of my devices defaulted to wind chimes, regardless of whatever I chose.  Called customer service and they couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  I was told 24 hours to get an answer.  In the meantime, as there is no way to reduce the volume of the very annoying wind chime notification, the only option option I have is to disable all notifications from Ring.  This defeats the purpose for the cameras altogether.

American Airlines at the Manchester airport in New Hampshire has a policy somewhere written on their website that states you must be at the airport 45 minutes before your flight in order to check in your luggage. The main reason for flying out of a small airport is that you do not need to be there extra early. My wife and I went to check in our luggage 43 minutes before the flight, and we were greeted by a blank look.  The woman at the desk said I cannot check your bags you are late you should‚Äôve been here 45 minutes. I asked if I could carry the bags on she replied no one bag is too big.  She then said, I will book you for another flight which would‚Äôve taken us into Orlando five hours after our conference started. After 10 minutes, she then said you could try to go through the TSA checkpoint. The agent at the TSA checkpoint found one item in our bag that could not be carried on which was a $30 item which had to be thrown out. When we went to board the plane the agent at the desk said I will check your bags but your one bag will cost $30. I agreed. He then waived the $30. Why even mention the $30 to make matters worse if you‚Äôre going to waive it. Had the original agent not delayed us  I would have removed that item from the bag and place it in my car.  Back to my original comment exceptional customer service is about finding solutions. The original agent could have simply stated it the beginning that we could go through TSA and they would check our bags in at the plane. Then inform us of the policy that you need to be 45 minutes early. | This app is horrible. Booking flight function doesn‚Äôt work. After putting all information in, there keeps being an error on booking page saying country code for phone number is not selected. But the selection box for country code does not work at all. It‚Äôs American. Why can‚Äôt they just default the phone number country code to +1 ??? Or make the app actually work? | All of us hate airlines because they are rude, late, treat their customers like cattle etc etc. just wanted to make a special point to let American Airlines know that after waiting well over an hour ( in the queue) I finally got on with the rudest and most unhelpful agent possible. I know to complain is futile because literally no one in this airline cares at all about what their customers think about their service | App keeps getting better and proving more details for the traveler. | Poo poo | AA now forces you to provide your health information to a 3rd party (Daon) in order to check in and have your boarding pass digitally. If you value health privacy AA‚Äôs new app requirements are not for you. | After reading all the complaints .I decided to not renew my status . I‚Äôve been traveling transatlantic more not on AA  it use to be a very good airline seven years ago but now the miles you can‚Äôt really use I often book business class but even the inflight crew is angry you are flying business The industry has become low class.

Also  the customer about the carry he had for years I agree it‚Äôs ridiculous it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a scam for you to pay to check bags . | Always a great experience from stepping into airport , on to planes and the landing- great service all the time. | Clutterd user interface. Most functions use www of apl. Errors out when trying to update basic personal data. Passport. etc.   Errors out out on basic commands | I was enjoying my flight experience with American Airlines until I arrived home to find out my bag was delayed and still in another state. I have no idea how it could‚Äôve happened because the people I flew with had theirs and we did everything together and watched the people lay them next to each other on belt. I am so disappointed, my valuables are in my bag and who knows if I will get my things. I literally paid to transfer my bag for it to not be transferred with me. I don‚Äôt think I will fly with American Airlines again! | It took more than 2.5 hrs of submitting forms, chatting via the app, and now being transferred to different reps a total of 4 times now.  All I did was put in the wrong month for my birthday when I signed up on the app for Aadvantage and there was no way to quickly update it on the app or website. Instead of bailing these airlines out with our tax money when they fail, we need to let them go and be with the Lord. | Just stay away from American Airlines no matter what you do!! Like all apps, you need a username and password. Along with your ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù number. (I just wish they had any loyalty to me!) However, the app keeps logging me out. So then I try to log back in. Will not let me. Ask to reset password. I answer all the security questions. Gives error message. It just goes round and round. I try calling the aa.com technical help. Ha!! No one ever answers the phone. I have never been so frustrated by a website/app. Ever!! I google some potential solutions. Clear all my cache data. Nope. Nothing!! 

Just avoid. I am cancelling my credit card ASAP. Not worth the headaches. Will just fly Delta! | A really good app, but not quite as good as Delta‚Äôs. | I‚Äôve been using the American app for years. However, after the last update to 17.4 the widget American Airlines app no longer works . | Features between app and website not equivalent, basic things like canceling a flight and seeing how much credit you will receive not present 

Fortunately there is only a 40 minute wait via their customer service line | Thank you to the crew - Susan, Renee, Ann, JC, Walter, Stacy and the rest of the crew. They were professional, helpful, kind and caring.  Excellent flight.  Thank you. | What an embarrassment for a mature airline to perform in amateur status.
From gate and terminal changes to delays in maintenance and then catering from one plane to the next has been over 1:39 hrs without a response according to the captain.
The frustration on the captains voice and the embarrassing details he has had to relay over intercom are of an incompetent airlines team members.
No response?????
They can‚Äôt get any answers 
I now have missed a flight connecting international on a trip scheduled where I‚Äôm losing money on hotel, car service, activities that were already reserve.

I need some kind of compensation for my time and days wasted because of AA. | So happy i joined the AA advantage looking forward to my next trip | Safe and comfortable flight with friendly attendants. | I used to love this app. For many months now, every time I try to book a reward flight, I receive a message that says an error occurred and to try later. Many, many times I have reached out to American Airlines and been told nothing is wrong with the app. I have deleted the app and reinstalled it multiple times. Nothing works. I now can‚Äôt book any award flights through this app. and they refuse to do anything about it. | Thanks for swapping my seat since you can‚Äôt manage flights. Also why does your employee think I can‚Äôt take my bag after showing it‚Äôs mine | Smooth flight arrived early and got my luggage. Everything went perfectly! | Wonky...have to check in for both legs of the flight (vs one time for just the flight).  Boarding passes in apple wallet don't auto update when you change/upgrade your flight.  They need to study the Delta app which is much better. | But then I‚Äôm usually flying Alaska Air and American‚Äôs app is nowhere near as well thought out as Alaska‚Äôs. Also my American digital boarding passes do NOT have the date on their face! It‚Äôs hidden under the info button. Very odd. And TSA has made me print paper boarding passes twice now. Dumb! Fix it American, please. | Just another screwup courtesy of AA | They are the worst airline out there. It‚Äôs countless delays. They had us board a 8:35 pm plane then told us after we boarded that the plane was just towed over here for a maintenance issue. Turns out a hydraulic needed replacement and it would take an hour. This was at 9pm. So we‚Äôve been delayed a hour and a half sitting in a plane like a sardine in a can with no airflow and stinky people.  

They don‚Äôt care. & have no accommodation for there passengers. They will never receive my money again.! | Flew first class as a treat for my birthday. Everything nice until I could not find my bag at baggage claim. Checked at Service Department and told it was on a different plane that would not arrive for an hour. I am writing this review as I wait. Not happy American. | It gives the directions inside of the airport as well as bag tracking and flight status easily retrieve mobile boarding passes very convenient!! | Delayed repeatedly then cancelled flight. Then after rebooking didn‚Äôt move my bags and tgey are days late and now will not deliver to my home. | American is a good priced airline that takes good care of you when things do not go perfect everywhere, but DFW. They are the worst at DFW. | This app does not allow you to do anything. | This app was working flawlessly until today. I went in the App Store and saw that it needed an update so I updated the app and it is still frozen when I click on my flight. I tried restarting my and phone and still nothing changed. Please update the app again to fix this issue. Once app is fixed I will give it a 5star review | Since you know everything else about me, why don‚Äôt you link the bags to my account when I check them in and then maybe tell them we‚Äôre gonna unload them and then when I get to DFW? | They are never on time and they are a horrible choice. | Great app. I use it with ease and to great effect. However, there is this notion that it can be used for the inflight entertainment. On my iPhone the APP simply displays a message to change settings and then it‚Äôs the browser, which is kind of klunky. It does not work ‚Äúthrough the app‚Äù. | Why is it so hard to get miles credited to my account? | Worst customer service. Took 3 days to get home after a cancelled flight and was repeatedly lied and mistreated by ground staff. Will do everything in my power to never fly American Airlines again. | Why is it so hard to buy baggage online? They don‚Äôt make it clear how to when checking in. You also can‚Äôt select it anywhere on the app or website after checking in???? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. | Very hard to do anything in this app

Even getting a receipt is hard. You can‚Äôt print or export to PDF or anything from the app

Awful. And a reason I use AA less than I could otherwise | Any time they have issues with delays there app slows down even more and makes it so hard to manage your flights.",4.66871,452702,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ef/86/38/ef8638a8-d6b2-b83c-bf98-32f38090b22d/a466cf96-d0b8-4933-a004-712c169cabaf_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/20/2a/bb/202abb5e-b5a6-422e-8a25-6c8b13e123d9/b203f252-2da3-4424-b41f-e5a160f319d7_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/d1/4f/f6/d14ff6ef-0735-bd44-e630-fb79cf03e56a/15dc9ae6-6197-4eed-b32e-f573b10f9f65_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/24/e7/48/24e7482c-eb67-4201-337f-df10f3923cda/a0993572-6cfd-48d2-9e6b-9e33be633b30_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/6d/05/1e/6d051ec3-9df0-8c1b-e2f3-cdcbc850c260/d5c6c07c-030b-4ce3-b07b-42ad7e50a98f_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/69/a5/0a/69a50a28-df8f-0226-fa04-78532a80bccf/74cbad7e-6922-405b-ac3f-9fc0f4c89308_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/9a/6b/c2/9a6bc276-7a75-249b-4b01-7d616c1a6a9d/5c705751-aa15-4ec5-9307-7a2d752457e9_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/f6/ab/c1/f6abc1eb-83f5-e255-1af9-c9481a1635a2/d69e5b27-1f36-4e39-be79-091b43559b36_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/d0/d0/d2/d0d0d22b-3b80-5a85-b4d2-ceae712a4997/acd85cc9-f694-4112-a07c-e2a03ae45242_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/33/f2/04/33f204e0-82fe-a543-00dd-106b1b898306/2e12941c-2fff-4483-85ad-70ccdb4303f6_iPhone_5.5_screenshot_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/d5/01/e0/d501e016-a74c-b6c2-458d-5479ad65a2c8/mzl.srjyedfx.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/cf/a7/6a/cfa76ab5-9673-6df9-f24d-b3fba326a75b/mzl.bkpzggls.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/ce/71/16/ce711626-0d22-3865-784d-a4e3a2140e3e/mzl.zkppygvh.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/bf/e1/d6/bfe1d6c9-956f-b179-30e6-a29c632d2db1/mzl.wuaebric.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/8e/2f/b1/8e2fb1e8-e78c-da2a-3094-9484d37a27f5/mzl.vnnmdcjj.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-

Then when I go to the inbox you pop up my member card page for a few seconds and raise my phones brightness to 1000%. Super annoying bug and should be a simple fix - please fix it. Mobile app is laggy also constant red badge notifications on the app have caused me to disable notifications entirely for the Costco app. Going into the inbox cranks brightness on he screen and it‚Äôs laggy/sluggish trying to open the inbox just to be clear the notifications. If you are going to spam your users at least do it in a way where they can quickly clear things. | Cart and payment keep throwing internal servers error. Kill the app and still throw the same error. Unable to complete shopping. | Worst grocery store app of them all. We want inventory and possibly store pickup eventually. I will search for an item I know they have in stock at my store and NOTHING will come up. We need all items in stock on the app with an inventory count or it‚Äôs worthless. This is setup for same day delivery and online shopping only. Walmart, target, Kroger, Safeway, etc ALL have waaay better apps but Costco is a bigger company than some of those. Worthless outside of online shopping. | Incredibly user UNFRIENDLY. Unless you have the precise name of the product you‚Äôre looking for it just won‚Äôt come up in SEARCH. Why  a company this efficient, one that as well oiled as this one is, that seems to train people in customer service, one thst offers the great deals it does to the public, one that makes every effort to make your entire experience incredible enjoyable when you‚Äôre in the stores and, yes, one which has the best darn shopping carts of any place in the world, why a company like that would have this god-awful incredibly unhelpful app is beyond me. 
What‚Äôs the point of having an appt that provides this poor a delivery. I hate this thing. Great company, really bad app. | The app is now filled with advertising and unneccesary notifications which causes it to take a long time to open.

We just want something to display member information and search for items. | How is it possible one of the largest retailers in the USA, has the worst App!! It‚Äôs impossible to look anything up, or simply find out if it‚Äôs in stock, and check the actual price in your local warehouse. I live 20 minutes from my local Costco. It isn‚Äôt convenient to run there if the majority of items I want are out of stock. Please can you just trash this App and start over!! Because we do love Costco the warehouse. | Better than Amazon | I need change my credit card | Instead of a user centric approach to what their members might find useful and helpful in in store and m commerce it's an advertising first horrible web based not mobile experience. Loading times are horrible, it's busy and confusing. A good example of a cloud first, tech first user last implementation. | Buggy, and slower that molasses in January.  Really ‚Ä¶ spend some of the massive profits you‚Äôre extracting on programming and systems. | I love my shopping experienceüòä‚ù§Ô∏è | I have been a Costco loyal customer since 09/1991 and always satisfied and happy wishing your company success and growing | So easy to use app and Love Danville Store too! | While it is very handy to have the app in lieu of my membership card at checkout, why does the screen brightness not stay according to my setting? The devs of this app think they know what brightness my phone should be (btw it‚Äôs full brightness). | Still can‚Äôt add to Apple Wallet. | App clear reset code page when reseting password, cant put in the verification code if it closes out, also clears out the shopping cart when you leave the app. | Cancel my auto renewal and will be shopping somewhere else just because of how bad the app is. Can‚Äôt sign in get constant emails that you have to tap five times to get the clear out and you can‚Äôt turn off notifications for these stupid emails. | So I have to pay an annual subscription for a more limited variety of products at the same or higher price than Walmart and in a store twice as far?
I looked for better quality products, for exclusive products, for better prices, for more convenience... Didn't find any of that. Costco seems to have a cult following in place of people shopping with purpose and comparing their other options. | App won‚Äôt show store price, so app it just an online ordering tool. Poor search results. Costco app doesn‚Äôt show products available in store. This is Costco‚Äôs choice and they could fix it. And reply to all the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù ratings: RATE THE APP, NOT THE STORE. | I love COSTCO but this app is so frustrating. It always loads so slow and trying to do anything with account management takes forever, if it even loads at all. You would think COSTCO would put more effort into their app and website to keep their members happy. I‚Äôd love to do order pick up/delivery through the app but just trying to browse items is a timely process. | This app is painfully slow. This REALLY needs to be addressed. | The fact that I have to open each Inbox notification fully to get the badge count to disappear is maddening. I should be able to mark things as read that I‚Äôm not interested in. And why must I click through my full account info to get to them?  Bad design. | Enjoying so far shopping online and still getting our Order in a reasonable time! | The only thing I like about this app is that it‚Äôs easier than trying to find my physical card when going to the store. 
The search function is completely broken unless you know the model number of the item you want. 
Freezes and breaks half the time you click on anything. | Makes ordering easy and convenient. Love knowing what on sale and coupons. | Super easy and handy to just use the app for everything. | UX on this app is ridiculous. It takes a while to find same day grocery delivery and I have no idea how to get to fuel anymore. Sam‚Äôs Club app is so much easier to navigate. Do better Costco. | Love Costco, good discounts and good quality | Doesn't do much good to have an app they won't let you login to | When i tap the Costco app to open it on my iPad, all I ever get is a white screen with a red C in the middle | I was looking at computers and monitor, every time I tried to sort the results of my search I got an ‚ÄúPage Not Found‚Äù error. | The app for the iPad will not let you sign into your account rendering the app useless. Over to the S*m‚Äôs Club app I go. | I recently had a product issue and J.T. Helped me at the store. He was very pleasant and patient. He really went above and beyond to help me. You guys are very lucky to have him on your team. Thank you J.T. | The Costco iOS app is a black eye on the rest of the operation. It is THAT bad.

Continual page re-loads, non-existant multi-tasking support, and long page wait times, all conspire to make your life difficult at best. Often, it‚Äôs actually impossible to get done what you‚Äôd like to do. I am not exaggerating. 

I recommend anyone who wants to do business with Costco (which I HIGHLY recommend!) avoid this app like the PLAGUE and log on using a PC or Mac instead. You can‚Äôt even log into their website on your iOS device if you have the app - it‚Äôll just redirect you to the terrible app!

The Costco app is unfathomably, inexcusably bad. Zero / Five stars if I could. Get your act together, Costco. Seriously. | Love the deals but i gotta have more of that gyro platter back by the chicken | Costco is the best | Love the way this company treats customers. Find it quite rare in todays big box businesses. 

Just ordered a computer, forgot to add the insurance I wanted. Quickly picked up the phone, shared the item number and was able to add it quickly. 

Thanks Costco | For a store chain that is so universally loved and admired in baffled how their website and their app make for some of the worst online shopping experience ever. Even basic things like zooming in a product photo is so cumbersome and glitchy. And then everything leads to this progress bar which loads and reloads again and again and nothing flows smoothly. And each and every time I give up and have to shut the app and just open the laptop and order from there. For such an atrocious app and website experience their online/tech teams should be fired. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, target have made such strides in their app and websites yet Costco app still functions like it‚Äôs the late 90s. Horrible and shameful. | Certainly not a shopping app by any stretch of the imagination. 
Near as I can tell, this app is only for purchasing items Costco chooses to list that you would like delivered.
You cannot search in-store inventory or prices of items you know they carry.
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs $2, $3 or $600 off! OFF WHAT?
Do you have, ‚Äúin stock‚Äù, an item I‚Äôm looking for???? WHO KNOWS, you can‚Äôt search for it!
Not too useful to know the location of every Costco in the United States. | App needs a lot of work starting from the search bar, to the crashing. Super annoying! | UX needs major improvement. Items in cart difficult to remove.

An update is supposed to improve not hinder the operation of the app ‚Ä¶ which Google has failed to comprehend or ...   Google Maps have been wrong more than they have been right in my experience. WAZE NEVER took me down a narrow road that led to a dead end in the middle of nowhere! That‚Äôs why I got WAZE. And in my honest opinion that was probably why the WAZE program was written, because Google couldn‚Äôt deliver.  And they don‚Äôt like fun!! All the avatars are gone! How can it be real time time if can‚Äôt report safely? Google is purposely killing WAZE in my opinion by making it harder to report safely as in ‚Äòuse the app as intended‚Äô by requiring more time and ATTENTION to operate therefore rendering the original intent of the app useless. JMHO üò¢ | I like a lot of things about this app however I hate at the same time and end up not using cause if the phone is connected to my car once I add the address it doesn‚Äôt give me options to see routes available it just starts the navigation straight away and if I want to see the route I need to disconnect the phone while I am lost and driving and it‚Äôs very annoying, on the top off that when I disconnect from the car and  stop the navigation to see the route it immediately erase the address and I have to type all again or reselect the address that sometimes save on history sometimes not‚Ä¶ once again all that nightmare while I am driving!! It would be a better app if it would do like google does! | I like that Waze updates me on police officers and some traffic patterns. But it is extremely dangerous. It changes your patterns while driving shaving one minute off is not really doing me any help and pulling me through 300 additional stops again is not a fair option to choose from

Now, when ask me to change Rt, I had to do it on my car screen instead of my phone, which is even more dangerous and I can‚Äôt figure out the Rt pattern.

I wish there was an option to stop getting routed through neighborhoods. I don‚Äôt want 368. Turns the mental stress and load of that is 10 times worse than just sitting on the highway. For example, no way routing me through downtown Atlanta was better than keeping me on 285 and taking me straight to Smyrna.. Grammatical errors using voice to text | Traveling from Louisiana to Washington, got to the border of New Mexico and Colorado in Raton, when we pulled off to get food. We were traveling north with no issues. Tried to get back on the road and Waze directed us to start traveling south. I noticed pretty fast since all the signs said South I-25, and we turned around, but Waze continued to say we needed to make a uturn and head south. Our eta changed from 8:20pm before the stop to 10pm after. Since it kept telling us to do a compete 180¬∞, I decided to pull up Apple Maps to get directions and when I did it put us on the correct route with the eta being 8:33. So not only was it the complete wrong way and had us backtracking, it wouldn‚Äôt have even got us there faster but 1 and 1/2 hours later. This app is defunked if it can‚Äôt give the right directions, especially if other apps have the same reporting features as this one now. | Been using App for years; had many destinations saved, routes, drives, narrator voices; now, suddenly, with no warning, for no reason, all that info is gone, and I have to start over like the first day!

I know the screen shows it but what if you can‚Äôt look at the screen because it‚Äôs heavy traffic? 

Just a recommendation. | Waze is one of those rare apps that i will go out of my way to write a review for. This app has saved from about 35 speeding tickets at this point and it‚Äôs the first thing i throw on when i drive. The routes are always efficient and the traffic data seems to be almost as accurate as google maps! I would say the only downside is the battery draw on your phone but if you have a charger and are using carplay, there is nothing to complain about. Would love to be able to mark hazards for other wazers from the other side of the road though! | The ‚Äúwhere to‚Äù disappears too quick when opening the app. | This app was awesome before the last update. The voice alerts for speed traps and red light cameras was great. Since the update, this feature is no longer available. Also, the app accesses your location even when you‚Äôre not using it. Please change everything back to how it was before this AWFUL update. | Waze stays open on my phone after I leave my car for some reason. I have to open it then close it to exit the app. If not caught it will drain battery | I have used Waze for years but finally had to delete this app because it requires location tracking to be enable and actually running at all times.   The only workaround is to disable location services whenever the app is not being used.   Its a shame because its otherwise a great app. | Had iPhone 7, worked great with CarPlay. Was a 5 star app. Upgraded to iPhone 15. Can‚Äôt report hazards, hazards aren‚Äôt announced, can‚Äôt get directions, it‚Äôs totally useless now. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling it, reinstalling it. Forgetting device on CarPlay, etc. can‚Äôt find information on user forums. | I enjoy the accuracy of the app I only wish that when you are arriving at your location, it will actually show the address and a picture of the location. For example, your destination is on the left or the right it literally just drops a pin in the middle of the block and it doesn‚Äôt show you that you‚Äôve arrived at said address it just tells you you‚Äôve arrived, there is no picture there is no address of which you put in. I use Waze a lot with Uber and it never gives me the final destination. I always have to switch over to Uber to see where the house is. | Fix this asap. | Apple Car Play - Intermittent operation tried everything still working intermittently‚Ä¶.. | Actualice mi IOS y simplemente no lo he podido usar me no muestra el kilometraje pido direccion pero se vuelve loco y me lleva a otra ubicacion. Si voy por una calle me muestra q voy por otra. Asi q ya no la uso | Unable to find gps coordinates | The new update basically accused me of lying about my age and showed jokes like ‚Äúwow a 2 year old driving a car!‚Äù! I don‚Äôt recall ever being asked to set it. But even if I set it wrong, being rude is not okat | I love this app 1 of the best I done download to navigate ‚ù§Ô∏è | Waze used to be good. It would direct people around traffic via back roads, finding better routes for all. But now so many go down back roads that it just clogs everything up, and Waze doesn‚Äôt recognize how bad they are. Waze sent  us to backroads for a merge, insisting it would get us there quicker, just a few minutes of traffic this way.

We‚Äôve been sitting in this traffic an hour, barely moving, debating a much longer route but no, Waze insisted we press on, that it was about to get better. It has not. Waze‚Äôs predictions are useless. | Sound no longer working, did all basic troubleshooting, reinstalled the app and updated to iOS 16.7 with no luck. | I used to love this app.  Best gps out there, for a little while.  Seems to me anymore that people just place hazards for the fun of it.  I‚Äôve seen countless times where I would say something was no longer there, and the pin remains.  Especially when it‚Äôs police.  And how in the world do you get rid of the stupid elf voice??? Even when I check all notifications and setting, somehow that dude still speaks to me.  It‚Äôs like nails on a chalkboard. | Waze now cannot even navigate to contacts in the phone, making it a pain to use if intending to use it as a GPS (the very thing it‚Äôs meant for).
Routing no longer allows simple reporting of street closures, so instead circles you back to try to force impossible turns.

It even tries to route you to things on the other side of a bay (Seattle area) rather than ones nearly to include ones along the current route. This is made worse since technically something being 16 miles away (but across the bay, so requiring about an hour to get to), shouldn‚Äôt be shown in lue of locations about 3 miles away.

It still has the benefit of fun voice options, and viewing other users on the map.p | Such a cute app it helps me get places quickly and gives me the best routes tells me if there‚Äôs an accident or any slow traffic. The kiddos entertain on car rides just watching little Waze characters. and have some low battery draining, but just keep it plugged in and you‚Äôll be good. This is a very good family map app and I definitely recommend it to every person young or old. | Waze used to be very accurate for commute times. Now it seems to consistently give optimistic estimations. I‚Äôd vastly prefer a realistic take than something that tends to get me there in 20-50% more time than it said it would. | I love this app it‚Äôs got good stuff but I wood suggest to put wiring Like there is cameras on the lights so that the person that is behind would respect if not then they should be a police man giving tickets | Constantly puts be in the wrong lane trying to avoid traffic in the dmv are. Ends up making me later than if I had just gone through traffic. | Waze, I like your map. I use all the time. I noticed that the speed limit is not showing while using Apple car play. Can you please correct this issue? I would be awe so grateful. Thank youüòÅ | Love this app! Would love to see a school icon because think of how many people use this app driving their kids to school. Thanks! | I got Waze a little over 4 years ago and have been using it ever since. I personally find this app easier to use and read than other GPS apps. I love this app for many reasons but let‚Äôs be real, the real reason is having Master Chief as my GPS voice. I hope they never stop having Master Chief as a voice option, it‚Äôs just too perfect! | Works incredibly well in open spaces, but where I live in Boston, it is remarkably frustrating because under the tunnels, it will lose reception. Also, when looking for larger areas, it will use the map directions, but it won‚Äôt use the directions as to where a person can actually drive into the complex or area.it has lost me multiple times with regards to larger parks or golf courses where it will bring me to the course, but not to the actual entrance of the course so I am driving around aimlessly looking for where I can enter. | It has a lot to improve its keep giving long ways and most stupid routes even tho i do not accept change in the route it keeps taking me the way it wants | Why does my Waze suddenly start speaking to me in another language? I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs Greek or Spanish.  
I do love the colors of the map on the new update however. | Has been the best, most useful, and easiest to use navigation app available. Lately, however, it has become very buggy. It seems to have started when they were bought out by Google. Perhaps they are just getting rid of the competition by abandoning it, because it has problems running on Apple Car Play. 1/2 of the time the map shows, but won‚Äôt show a route, you can‚Äôt interact with it on the car‚Äôs touch screen display, and it won‚Äôt go into dark mode. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a blank screen until you shut the car off and restart it. I don‚Äôt want to use Google Maps or even Apple Maps, but often, I don‚Äôt have a choice because Waze won‚Äôt work. Update: Just as soon as it started working again, they updated and totally ruined the app. Don't know why developers destroy apps with updates that completely change it. With this update, they have pretty much eliminated users reporting incidents, police, objects on road, etc. Because now, instead of two screen taps to report, it now takes at least three and sometimes four. which is not safe to do while driving. I'm not reporting anymore because they have made it more time consuming and cumbersome. I know many users will also stop because of this, which eliminates the feature that set Waze apart from Google or Apple maps.
They also got rid of the on screen speed limit signs, which is another negative change making the app not worth using anymore. | Has not been working since updating to ios17 | Mostly useful for looking at real time traffic conditions and routes  around them well. 

Comes up short on logical routes in denser areas, routing into heavy traffic vs around it. 

Use as a reference but also review routes and make own judgement calls. | The new update makes it extremely difficult to find saved destinations.  It also don‚Äôt show my calendar appointments and desertions anymore. The app version is the current update located on Apple Store and my iPhone is running iOS version 17.4. 

The new App update also won‚Äôt give in-app access to Amazon Music anymore. It only allows Apple Music. Before update I was able to chose Amazon Music as my Waze in-app Music. The update removed it and now I can‚Äôt choose. | Since update I cannot get Waze into dark mode during the day like I used to be able to do. Yes my cell is selected dark mode on the cell. Connect to the car screen goes in light mode. Thermos NO selections in setup on the car navigation screen or anywhere else in car setup to go to dark screen. This only happened after update. I uninstalled Waze re download Waze fresh reinstall. Connected and same results. What is weird is on my my wife‚Äôs car screen she also couldn‚Äôt go into dark mode. Was like this for several days or weeks then all of a sudden while she was driving in the day time Waze switched to dark mode. We both have the same make of vehicles hers 23 camera, me Tacoma 22. I don‚Äôt understand how hers finally all by it self went into dark mode as she and I both prefer. I‚Äôm giving it a few more days and if Waze doesn‚Äôt change will be deleted. | Not by tap shows alternative route as used to be 
Once click that  only one route ! Pleaee fix this 
Used to show local and fast   So pleaee fix this thanks | I gave this app one star and here‚Äôs why. I‚Äôve used Waze for years and for a long time it was invaluable to me. I drive a lot and I mean a lot for work in city traffic and up until recently Waze had an option where you could see alternative routes while you were already navigating. This was what made Waze really work for me. Driving in a city there are multiple ways you can go. Waze will always send you the shortest time route. But sometimes that route makes you cross over four lanes of traffic without a stoplight and other things like that. So when I can search other ways to go, sometimes it is worth one extra minute for my safety or less stress, but I can no longer do that because Waze took away that ability. Until they put it back as someone who drives all the time it doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore. I am very disappointed. For the record, Waze still gives you alternative routes but only when you first put in your location so if I wanted to see an alternative route, I would have to completely close out the app and reopen it and put in the address again which is just not safe or possible when you‚Äôre driving | Love the app. The newest update, however, has the navigation not giving all information. It will say ‚Äúin 1 mile.‚Äù But never say what to do anymore. | I personally love this app I use it every day when driving has saved me countless times from getting a ticket I know that it has a high battery drain but that‚Äôs why you keep your phone plugged into your port in your car to avoid all that glad to see the report police on the other side icon has come back. Happy about that overall this app like I said has saved my butt many times over have been using this app since it first came out and will be using it until something better or this app is replaced. Either way it goes I‚Äôm a loyal Waze user. | I wish like Google you can drive while having it in satellite view.

Horrible customer service, ended up sleeping in airport sitting her now thinking I won‚Äôt trust them again.  Just can‚Äôt believe the lack of customer service.  Over priced I expect more. | Why do I need to give full access to my calendar just to add flights to my calendar? | Super easy to use!! | The app is absolutely horrible. There was no acknowledgment of uploading the passports, even when calling a week before. The Dominican Republic requires a special E ticket that was not acknowledged ahead of time. Will never fly again. Letting all my friends know. | F√°cil y r√°pida, me encanta | This app is not working correctly. Not even the reviw section is allowing me to see what i am writing right now! Disaster | I am a 13 year old boy who loves to fly in airplanes, my family has flown with many airlines we had problems with all of them except for delta. The service is awesome they let people know ahead of time if they have to cancel they offer you food coupons and show you hotels for you to stay in. I have asked for things that are only in first class but I was sitting in common class and they were really kind and brought me some. They sometimes have to cancel but it is not always the airlines fault for example maybe the pilot is running late are they suppose to take off without a pilot? When there are situations of people being rude or there is a problem they do there best to handle it without getting authority‚Äôs involved. They have been very accommodating when my family  was split up to get us seats together. I have a uncle that is a pilot for American so we could fly stand by with them but we like delta more. LOVE delta amazing airline. | Lot of refreshing all the time. | This makes being a loyal elite member difficult! Nothing updates or works correctly. | So many things changed. More complicated. Frustrating to use. 
1-800 from now on | Seamless experience every time.  I  enjoy Delta | I would like to get check on reminders and flight status updates but I don‚Äôt get them by text or email | Changed a flight departure City with a fair change, showing an e-credit of $354. When I go to check in it will not process so I called customer service and they see that I‚Äôm supposed to be issued an e-credit of $354 confirmed it with a supervisor but for some reason can‚Äôt process it so they send me to the refund group and the refund group tells me I owe an additional $43 to be able to fly home and if I don‚Äôt pay it I‚Äôll be stuck in Canada. Then I get transferred to customer service who tells me Yep you gotta pay that or you‚Äôre not flying and all I can do is write a report for our IT team to find out why you were promised something on the app and we are not going to honor it. I feel totally scammed and delta. Definitely lost a customer. | Every time I tap ‚Äúshow boarding pass,‚Äù I‚Äôm taken to a weather report for my inbound city. Super annoying and defeats the whole purpose of the app. | 1 day before leaving I was trying reserve airport parking. It asked for return time. As I was within one day of departure, the apps single focus was the flight out. Nowhere to be found was info on the return flight. The app was great in letting me know our flight was leaving out of gate B20. Thankfully we were very early and the extra time needed to go to the correct gate T6 wasn‚Äôt an issue. I was expect better from Delta | Ever since I bought my ticket, Delta has been nagging me to upload my passport with the app. I can‚Äôt upload it to the app, far as I can tell. Can‚Äôt upload it online. They already had it saved to my account, but they want a scan. But I can‚Äôt upload the scan and the app doesn‚Äôt handle that. Okay Delta. You already had my passport. I installed the app and linked it to my account. Please stop nagging. Or consider doing something to make my life better, instead of telling me what you want me to do without it ever benefiting me | 1. Just Google your flight number. There‚Äôs more info there than the Delta app. 
2. Even when you input info online (KTN, international travel docs, etc.) it doesn‚Äôt save it to the Delta system, so you have to redo it all with an agent at the airport. | I remember now this is one of the reasons I stopped flying Delta | Delays for weather and Pilots timing out. 10 hours. Incorrect information given. Or no information given regarding potential departure. Worse, plane took and held onto our hand-luggage. So I couldn‚Äôt leave. Didn‚Äôt have necessary comforts. For 10 hours. I felt like I was being held hostage. 10 hours of poor communication in the tech age. Ground staff were ill-informed. Never knew what was going on or how to help. We were sent to gate 84. Then gate 93 then gave 84 then gate 93 then gave 84 again and finally gate 93. No water. No snacks. No where for babies or young kids to sleep. No idea where our carry-on bags were. (Airline staff had asked us to check it with them. But when we were told to leave the plane they didn‚Äôt give the bags back. The only was was to get back on the same flight. Which by the way wasn‚Äôt just delayed. It was cancelled after midnight. Then‚Ä¶ UN-Cancelled?!? What poor communication was that about. It needs an answer for you at Delta. | We love flying Delta, easy friendly app able to book and select seats | Something had recently changed with the iOS app that is making it really annoying. Its really slow and crashes periodically. I have been trying to download my boarding pass to my apple wallet unsuccessfully for 20 min and it just crashed again and logged me out. I am a bit surprised that the app is so bad for the company and airline of this caliber. The login experience is buggy and inconsistent. In some cases my login screen requires last name, but in some cases the last name field only appears after i enter my password, on some screens last name is in the middle between user id and password, and some screens its at the bottom under the password. You guys created a bit of a cluster that you should test and address. | Stop the automatic change the brightness increase!!!!! | I am surprised they don‚Äôt charge you every time you open up the app or say the word Delta. Cuz they charge you for literally everything else. Wanna choose a seat? Wanna travel with a bag? $100. | So far, terrific. Keeping connected is key. | Love you!! | Paid for internet and was not able to use it. Asked about it and was told they didn‚Äôt know anything about it. | Friendliest and most caring personnel ever! 
There communication is efficient at all points of our travel. I only fly Delta! Best airline. | The gal was extremely helpful in helping with luggage and checking us in! Very friendly! | I have never been so annoyed by the process to check in. I had to enter my information at Least 3 times. United is better. Step up, folks. Stop sucking. 

-CB | Our family always chooses Delta‚Ä¶ we love it! | Fantastic | I‚Äôm always satisfied with Delta. Everyone is pleasant and professional. | Thank you for a lifetime of travel. Thank you for always keeping safe. Thank you for being caring and of excellent service in everything you do. 

DELTA is #1 in my heart and home. 

To millions and billions of miles still to fly in my lifetime.

Until next time, Keep Serving Aces!!! üéæüéæüéæü©∑üôèüèªüèÜüòä | I find Delta app the easiest user-friendly airline site | Arrived at airport, checked in two hours prior to flight. Was getting ready to board an hour and half later, still didn‚Äôt have the boarding pass updated. | Delta never disappoints. If you have issues it‚Äôs resolved quickly and on time. I love delta app. Customer service is courteous, friendly, reliable, excellent. I tell all my friends to fly Delta. I love flying with Delta airlines. Try their SkyMiles, it‚Äôs awesome. | Love the service of Delta personal! | In the mean time my boarding pass was unscannable.  In all fairness though, this is what I‚Äôve come to expect from Delta. | I normally do not have many issues with this app, but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶trying to check in to my flight home and it‚Äôs only allowing me to check in 1 of 2 passengers which means I‚Äôll need to get to the airport much earlier than planned to get this done.  Not happy. | App is not user friendly and convoluted hard to work through | Delta flight 1150 Atlanta to Orlando leaving at 2:45 pm from Atlanta allowed 4 people who were not at gate have their tickets scanned by a 5th person ‚Ä¶.thus allowing any one to board the plane‚Ä¶flight attendants told‚Ä¶they did nothing‚Ä¶..this is why we had 911‚Ä¶it was the airlines fault‚Ä¶. | Best people, best customer service, best airline, bar none‚Ä¶. | Your latest version still does not allow for flight information to be downloaded directly to iOS calendars. The error says privacy settings have to be changed but there is no privacy settings options in the Fly Delta App and the device privacy settings does not show Fly Delta as an option. | Trip Den-Sea. Flight attendant was aggressive and rude. She showed how unhappy she is with her job . 
It‚Äôs my first time for awhile when I flew with main cabin reservation.  I was surprised with level of service up there. You feel a huge difference in service between business/comfort and main cabin. | Lax oversized line Fiona was efficient and charming | Gate changes do not update in a timely manner. Use the airport boards.  Do not rely on this app for departure info. Or if you do just be prepared to run. | The pilot and flight attendants have been very friendly and professional from their appearance to their approach in communicating.

It takes 50 tries to hit the search button. It is so bad | I went to use the multiview feature on the app when they released it yesterday and now the entire home screen won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve called support three times and got hung up on and nobody seems to know what they‚Äôre doing. YouTube TV doesn‚Äôt care about his customers. Don‚Äôt care about anything other than the money that you spend on it. | The concept of this app is great, but the execution is horrendous. 

1. There is a problem trying to watch any sort of local channel on my phone. I receive a message to ‚Äúunlock to watch‚Äù and it won‚Äôt play the show. I triple checked that my location services are on. I‚Äôve went through support and their only suggestion was to uninstall and reinstall the app. Believe it or not, didn‚Äôt work and I still can‚Äôt watch any local channel on my phone. 

2. The audio issues are starting to become a recurring theme. Many of my shows audio will cut in and out every few seconds, rendering the show absolutely unwatchable. I checked the same show on multiple devices and they all have the same issue, so definitely an issue on YouTube TV‚Äôs end. 

3. The app needs to be completely restarted almost every day on my Apple TV. Many times I will click a button to try and play a show, but the app will do something completely different. For example - When I end a show and try to click the next episode, the app will rewind my current episode 15 seconds and do nothing else. I then have to restart the YouTube TV app just so the app can function properly again. This is just one example but there are many more. 

Like I mentioned before, I want nothing more than to love this app, but it has been over a year and none of these issues have been resolved. In that time period, YouTube TV increased its monthly subscription price. Why is your service getting more expensive but you‚Äôre not fixing any of the daily problems we have with your service? Some of these problems quite literally prevent people from using your service. It might be time to look elsewhere for your TV Service. | There is literally no app worse for streaming live tv or any other videos. They might as well disable the ability to use this on mobile! Smh | I never used to have an issue but now the app freezes every time I try to play a TV channel. I will be canceling my YouTube TV membership if they don‚Äôt fix this as I watch TV more on my phone than my actual TV. | Hello! I‚Äôm super happy they brought multi-view to the iPhone and I‚Äôm able to chrome cast it! But will there be a way to customize what to watch in multi view so that I can watch NFL/NBA on the same screen as espn | V8.12. Again, please continue to send zero stars ratings their way until they turn around and put up sensible comments with the update. Bad reviews all over. Pathetic to see version history. | Since the last update when I get on YouTube and ask if I want to login into my TV set to watch YouTube TV if I wanted to watch the TV I would have logged into that app not YouTube. They‚Äôre different things. Can you all please fix this? It‚Äôs irritating. They‚Äôre two different apps, even though they‚Äôre owned by the same company most likely. | First time launch the app freezes when I select ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button. After closing the app and reopening it never gets past the splash screen. Please fix | I honestly don‚Äôt get all of these bad reviews! I love YTTV! I don‚Äôt have any issues with freezing on my phone, in fact‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 10 times better than any experience I‚Äôve had in the past with DISH, DirectTv and many other cable provider‚Äôs apps on the phone! Completely blows them out of the water!!

My only issue is I wish there were channel numbers so that I could go straight to a channel instead of having to click through the whole channel guide to get to what I want to see. 

I‚Äôm looking into a work around today with the Google Nest Hub, hoping that‚Äôll allow me to go straight to a specific channel with voice commands. Fingers crossed! | Would be great if the ads weren‚Äôt every 5-6 minutes. Makes it hard to keep using the app. | Whatever they did, with no apparent indpedent QA or UAT, there is no longer any way to switch from channel to channel by selecting ‚Äúdown‚Äù and then moving to another channel.   YTTV = hot mess. | I have tried for hours to contact customer service. My area location keeps changing and I can‚Äôt access my shows. | Ad breaks range between 5-6 times per show, and have 1 - 12 ads in a row that you have to sit through and watch. Not worth it for $70+ a month. | How can YouTube spend so little effort in making an App is mind boggling. It‚Äôs such a joke. After this month I‚Äôm cancelling service | Turn on notifications Mark episodes as watched Setup your family group ‚ÄúAre you traveling‚Äù Can‚Äôt manage billing, blocked from both app and web. | Request simplifying the app. Make it user friendly, it‚Äôs too complicated now. | Service is great on smart TV but watching on the mobile app is like using archaic modems to stream the shows.  It‚Äôs extremely choppy.  Very bad experience. | If you recorded a program, watching it back is tedious. Youtube TV adds so many additional advertisements  (mostly 6 at a time, and it‚Äôs almost in every 5 minutes) that it makes it impossible to enjoy. And of course it‚Äôs not cheap. If the app is going to soil your program with so many ads why is it costing a bunch of money?! Totally not worth it!!! | Used YouTube tv for years. Moved so I had to change and recently returned to using it. One major problem is that the guide and tv done stop themselves or reload. If I shut my tv off at 11, then turn it on again at 7am. It is still trying to load the guide for 11 to midnight the night before. I have to force stop it and reopen it to work. Didn‚Äôt used to do that. Not sure why it is now. Makes absolutely no sense at all. | Replays the same movies and tv shows. Had it for 2 months, spend more time watching commercials! Don‚Äôt waste your money. Get used to watching more commercials than actual tv. I just mute them at this point, they are so frequent an annoying! Seems like the commercials are louder! But otherwise you‚Äôll end up looking through movies an seeing it‚Äôs the same few choices from a day ago. O don‚Äôt think your falling asleep with YouTube tv on omg smh. The commercials really scream at you. | You pay $70 a month for this and have not been able to watch a single video on it without the app, crashing, completely shutting down, or crashing so badly to the point where I have to delete the app and re-download it. Trying to figure out how to cancel my subscription now because the App won‚Äôt even open for me anymore. | Tried using this app I‚Äôm paying lots of money for.  Not only is my KOMO tv glitching, this app freezes when I touch that channel.  What a bunch of junk.  Getting so tired I‚Äôm gonna go back to cable. | Does the job nicely | I am a big fan of google, youtube, but this youtube tv is the worst app that I have seen fir years, things get disappearing in a minute in the app. | Not only did your prices go up, but there was two channels that you took away,. The most were taken away, which was the MLB network and Sportsnet New York. | There is no way I will pay for this when I can get streaming apps that play better don‚Äôt for much less! | Whenever I try to view a channel when scrolling through the live list nothing happens and the app freezes - iPhone 12 max | Freezes upon opening. Billion dollar company can‚Äôt make an app that works. | Without the ability to play audio in the background (and with screen off, and PiP), and without the ability to adjust playback speed, this app is completely useless to me. | I love my YouTube TV, but recently when watching, the commercials are so freaking LOUD!!! I am not HOH. There is nothing wrong with the volume on my TV. It is YOU. I am about to write a letter to the FCC. There is absolutely no need for the volume to automatically raise during commercials. Shame on you! | I‚Äôve quit using this app on my TV. Seems to work for a while then can‚Äôt get it to not crash everytime I reopen.  Other streaming apps have no issues, and if I access youtube tv through the regular YouTube app also never crashes.  I used to think it was an issue with my tv then realized none of the other apps do this.  I‚Äôve reinstalled, reset tv, etc.  Sometimes lasts for a while sometimes crashes right away again. | YouTube continues to ignore customer feedback and deny people the ability to listen to content while the screen is locked. | Excellent and very efficient and professional | I pay for the app monthly but can‚Äôt even watch shows on it because it will never load anything select on it | Commercials on DVR when chromecasting 
Extra charge to download to watch offline
Extra charge to watch 4k
Consistent audio glitches that resolve when you restart the app
DVR user interface is badly organized | Misleading and inaccurate information up front. Google needs to fix this immediately. | Don‚Äôt get how this does not get 5 stars. Great app! Yes, expensive, but it is worth it, if you watch tv. Love it! | I‚Äôm a new subscriber and need to share that this app freezes randomly every time I use it. There is no consistency to the freezing: when browsing networks, viewing program details, switching between views, settings, freezing happens anytime and everytime I use it. | Very reliable, easy-to-use, and full of good content. | The picture, sound and user interface are SO much better than on DIRECTV Stream! | Whenever the ad break comes on the screen just goes black and can‚Äôt see anything. Horrible app. | I use this services during college football to watch on Saturdays. I canceled the service as soon as the season was over and on 2/28/2024 I get charged again and they refuse to refund me my money. I now cannot make it to work for the remainder of the week as the over drafted my bank and I no longer can get gas. Screw you youtube | The live tv guide is a terrible list that doesn‚Äôt let you see what‚Äôs on later. You can only see what‚Äôs on now and not what‚Äôs coming next.

SlingTV and DirectTV Stream both have far better guides. | The ads constantly play in the wrong language and I can‚Äôt fix it and you haven‚Äôt fixed it so two stars. | So frustrated with your platform! On a daily bases it crashes repeatedly over and over. It happens when I‚Äôm in the middle with watching something‚Ä¶going to my Home Screen on my TV, where I then have to restart YouTube TV, search for my show and try again. Please fix asap. If things don‚Äôt get better‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to have to search for other options | Constantly freezes.

Shame! | I used to love this app and used it all the time. For the last month, when I selected bill pay, it would say it is being updated, use the webpage. Now with the latest update, it says bill pay is not available on the app. Then why still have the button for it?  Bring it back!!  It was so convenient and the only reason I used the app. Now it is worthless. And stop asking me to buy a car! | This application is almost half a gigabyte yet I have to use mobile web to make a bill payment.

The bank itself does some shady stuff, like lower APR on interest accounts. Maybe that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so easy to open a new account. | You make unnecessary hard to now pay our bills from the app. You have a button for it to take you to the website. Why keep the app? | The service is fine, however I cannot get the Apple Pay card activate button to complete. So I can‚Äôt add my card to Apple Pay. From the cap app You tap let‚Äôs go> activate> it brings up where I‚Äôm supposed to enter the exp date and it won‚Äôt let me before force closing the app. Please fix this | Been a long time customer. Everything was working just fine. Now bill payment does work, which is very important part of the app. Called support - keep telling me that it‚Äôs in work. It‚Äôs been 2 months already. Where are the famous IT people? | I asked for an increase in my credit line to help me get a rental at the airport; after long waiting period just to hear the word no. All I wanted was to go to my brother‚Äôs funeral. | i‚Äôve been using c1 for a few years now, and it works really well for me. my only issue is that it doesn‚Äôt notify me for any declined payments, unless they‚Äôre from my apple subscriptions. i typically keep my card locked because of weird transactions when i keep it unlocked (and packages that i have not ordered coming to my house, despite my not purchasing anything. i have never once been able to get a refund on these). the app would me much better, in my opinion, if push notifications came through about any declined payments. other than that and having to open an entirely new account to get a savings account, i have had no issues. | My bill pay has been down for over a month. That makes this app not convenient. | The app used to be fantastic. I was able to do all my banking from my phone. Recently, billpay has stopped working. Has been unavailable for a couple of months now. | I enjoyed using this app until you removed being able to pay using my debit card. I absolutely LOATH when I have to pay for things the other way. Takes days to be taken from my account. Where as with my debit card it is instant. definitely won‚Äôt be using this card as much once paid off. Why would anyone who is paying all their bills at once want things to be taken out 3-5 days later. Absolutely absurd. Good luck keeping customers because when paying bills we like convenience and this change is most certainly a inconvenience. Also love how we got NO NOTICE of this change. BOOOOOOOO | Of all cards that I use Capital One has worst application. I made my payments but still after a week also it‚Äôs not reflecting on my available balance.
How can I use this card to pay the bills even after I made my payments. | It seems like with every ‚Äúupdate‚Äù the widget will get worse over time. I used to be able to refresh the widget information by simply bringing it into view. It‚Äôs now at the point where I can‚Äôt even get up to speed information without restarting my phone. Fix it!!!! | Been using over a year (credit card), still don‚Äôt understand how this banking app doesn‚Äôt have a pin login! Having to enter my entire password every time to log in is inconvenient when checking an account in a pinch. Also, no dark mode‚Ä¶weird in this day and age. And the amount of adverts and pushing branded partnerships is kind of gross. Using their HYSA intermittently and a credit card consistently, I also just opened a checking account but the ACH is expected to take a whole week, which is fine because it‚Äôs going to take an estimated 11 days to even get the debit card so my money there is tied up! If it takes more than a day to receive my deposits (currently takes overnight to my A bank if requested by 4p PST), I‚Äôll definitely not be using them for checking! Very sloooow, outdated banking.  I do like the ability to lock my credit card at least! | The app does what you want it to; it is simple and easy to use. I especially like the ability to sign in with a pattern as well as the ability to pay when you are away from your desktop. Please allow us to see a total of our pending charges; Chase does it and you do it on your website . | Used to love this app. Now they‚Äôve removed the bill pay. Giving people less isn‚Äôt such a great business model. | Please fix the widget. It‚Äôs nothing but a black screen. It‚Äôs been this way for a while now. | Anytime you change screens there is a popup ad for buying a car, ridiculous.  Junk app now | No!!! I DO NOT WANT TO SHOP CARS. STOP ASKING ME ON EVERY SINGLE PAGE!!!!!!!! | So I just recently signed up with capital one. As I am waiting for my physical card, I attempted to get my digital one. There was an automated process to upload front/back of photo id, which kept failing even though the pictures were perfectly clear. I gave up after about 10 attempts, I try again later and now it‚Äôs only a code to my phone to verify. I keep trying to get a code sent and I receive a popup with this message. ‚Äú Sorry, you have reached the max attempts for adding a new mobile number.‚Äú So yeah based off my current experience, this app is very buggy and imo 2 stars is being generous, but like I said my reviews solely based off app experience so far. | I just did ten years in prison when I was released I had no money thank god capital One gave me a chance and it helped out so much | The app says we've hit a snag. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Still the same. Is it broken? What's going on? | Only editing my review because I can‚Äôt get in the app since it updated a few mins ago. Fix please üôÇ | 490MB. I have to keep uninstalling this app because I dont have room for it on my phone!! | Capital One is a sexist bank. Did you know that they approve men with a high credit line? I had 3 cards with them and they only gave me a $300 credit line for each card and never increased my credit lines. I have a male family member who had the same credit score as me and he got approved for an zqinitial line of credit of $3,500. Make that make sense. Capital One will also close your credit cards without notice and say that you account was considered ‚Äúa risk‚Äù even when payment history is at 100% of payments made on time and cards were paid off. Don‚Äôt waist your time with them. It‚Äôs not worth risking your credit for a sexist bank! | How do you have a mobile banking app in 2024 that doesn‚Äôt allow me to pay bills? You also can‚Äôt view images of checks. Not impressed user experience at all. Can‚Äôt have both my wife and I have access to our children‚Äôs savings accounts. What a pain. | App requires an upgrade every other week when ever i try to use it. | Well, it took numerous reviews over the years to get a darkness added to this app and for once I wasn‚Äôt getting a blast of light in my face. Now it seems you have taken that back away and it‚Äôs back to the way it was, absolutely stupid and if it weren‚Äôt for me needing this for my account I would dump it. Idiotic to not give an option to have a dark mode. Some of us are sensitive to bright lights and this app could be used as a flashlight. Dumb! | I‚Äôve been a capital one banking customer from the days when it was ING direct.  I loved the app until they took away bill pay.  Sure I can do Zelle but I can‚Äôt pay my credit card or my car payment that way.   Used to be able to pay my bills in minutes with the app, now I have to go on my computer to do it.  That interface is good but I don‚Äôt know why they took away the bill pay in the app. Please bring it back! | I have been using this app for years and it has been fantastic‚Ä¶ until now. I can no longer pay my bills from this app which doesn‚Äôt make it very helpful. You can only do this on the web. I may remove this app because of this change. Very disappointed. And now I can no longer successfully do a check deposit, never had an issue until now. And all the nicknames for my account disappeared. What is going on here Capital One??? This needs to be fixed! | The company is too dependent on app usage for there not to be available updates for users with ios14. Other banking apps are continuing to actively update and this is is a very inconveniencing exception to that standard. | Love the app. Easy to navigate and informative.  I e issue is that when I recently got a new phone, 15pro, I am no longer getting push notifications and can‚Äôt seem to turn on anywhere. | Payment posting time too long 
Absolutely upsetting 
Keep transaction on hold without any reason | App never works and the website is just as bad ! | It‚Äôs 2024, how is there still no dark theme for this app? | For the past several months all of a sudden we can no longer pay our bills on the app! This was a feature I used FOR YEARS!! So much for banking reimagined!! You must be paying so much to Jennifer Garner, that you can‚Äôt even fix an app feature that is basically a necessity for this day and age! I now am forced to log into a desk top computer to pay my bills!! No other baking app seems to have this issue!! What is going on Capital One!?!? | The app hasn‚Äôt worked for me in months. I can submit my credentials on the log-in screen and get met with the spinning circle of death indefinitely until I force quit the app. Forgetting my username or deleting and reinstalling the app does nothing. | Sorry I am not eligible.   Due to age.  8 and illnesses.  Imay not drive.   I wish but it is not going to happen.   Jeanette mason | 1. You never sent my card 
2. i need my card details to receive help via customer service 
3. tell me how am i supposed to get help 
FIX YOUR LOOPHOLES that make it impossible for new users to get started!!! HOW CAN I ENTER MY DETAILS IF IM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE I NEVER FOR THE CARD??? stop not allowing people to contact chat until they log in when you‚Äôre stopping actual customers from Logging In?! | I‚Äôve used the app for years and never have had an issue when I get a new iPhone. Now it won‚Äôt let me sign in at all. 

It‚Äôs been over a week!! What‚Äôs up? You need to drop an update and fix the bug. 

For now I have to constantly sign in online. This is a mess! | I cannot even find any working features to even make a payment on my card | I just don't understand why it takes almost half a billion characters to write an app that lets me check my balance, then they stop it from worjlking and they mdke me update it with another half a billion characters so I can still check my balance again. | The Capital One app has more errors and bugs than literally any other mainstream bank app other than Wells Fargo. They removed bill pay entirely from the app after saying it was being upgraded. What a joke. | I've never had any issues with mobile deposit but suddenly it won't work. Keeps saying front and back are not a check, which is incorrect.  It previously had no issues depositing these checks and not sure if this problem was caused by the latest update or what. I've tried several times on both my iPhone and iPad to no avail. This needs to be addressed ASAP. | Stay away at all prices | Why hasn‚Äôt Capital One made it available to add to Apple Pay? | I use the mobile app mostly for paying bills. Please fix that feature already! | Delete my bad reviews gonna report you now. You guys should too | Why get rid of the most important features!? No more bill pay on the mobile app. Plus I have to drive AN HOUR to the nearest ATM. Will be closing my accounts.. | Capital one plays with people's money! It used to be good! Now if you pay for your card it takes 3 to 5 days! Your transactions are bounced for 5 dollars! Don't pay for money gram, they steal your money!

It has all the desirable features of any music player and has a very simple, understandable, and helpful layout. The subscription of course carries across all devices, and is absolutely worth it if you‚Äôre an avid music-listener. I find myself a lot more content using it over Spotify as well, having many more hours of usage than I did before and makes it really worth the money. | Needs internet to even access your offline content like your paid music you paid for to use while your offline, Somehow it separates your google play music from your mp3 vs google play where they all were together You have to download each google play song separately, imagine if you have hundreds of songs vs downloading them all at once, you shouldn‚Äôt even have to download it if it‚Äôs already on your phone, this makes no sense! They are following apple with the Apple Music by making YouTube music

Ridiculous: 03/22 YouTube music replaced Google music, I paid a lot of money in buying MP3 from google music. Google transition, you download all the songs you paid for but the catch, the software only works on YouTube music! Now today, I find I can‚Äôt listen to many of the Songs I paid for! Because if you live in NYC and use the trains, many spots are offline and it says expired for offline listening, then it‚Äôs not a MP3 then! | I can get all kinds of music and videos here without interruptions. From dance music to how to dance videos. And I can download them for when I‚Äôm traveling and away from WiFi. Again, one of the few remaining reasonable priced deals around. | Very much appreciating the ad supported version to this app. YT music catalog is unrivaled when it comes to finding new music/artist, YT has captured every phase we went through over the years. Recommendations not only push popular artist, but also artist of whatever genre you search for. Lots of unreleased music/underground artists can be found here which makes the app the go to for someone like me with alternative taste. When it comes to saving the music I like, if the ‚Äúliked‚Äù tap had more organization, such as alphabetically organizing every song or by date added, it would make YT music that much better vs scrolling through every song I‚Äôve ever liked! | Can you please add equalizer to iOS because I need it üò≠üò≠üò≠ | youtube music has helped me find songs and remixes i never would have found on spotify, not only is it a lot less restrictive on skips but it also allows you to listen to the song you look up when you look it up! overall in discovery and in use YT music is the most convenient and consistent app i‚Äôve ever used for music.

I love how it keeps‚Ä¶ my music! | It amazing there‚Äôs song that I like cause they are videos, but with this app you can play those song u like plus you have the whole YouTube songs inventory, it‚Äôs simple just amazing app | La m√∫sica que me recomienda es justo lo que busco, me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n ‚ù§Ô∏è | Shuffle is a joke, I have thousands of songs in my playlist but it keeps repeating the same few | Stop changing my music it gets annoying I can‚Äôt hear my own music every time I play it‚Äôs changes with other songs that aren‚Äôt it I can‚Äôt find my music anymore it really frustrating just stop messing with my playlist | Everybody watches YouTube, but YouTube Music takes all my favorite songs (even the hard to find ones) and puts it in one app! It‚Äôs all right at the tip of my fingers and I absolutely love it! None of the other music apps, paid or free, even come close. | Every time I load up a song, artist, album, or playlist, it crashes every time I loaded it up on it, though. So yeah! Please fix it soon on that crash on that update please. Thanks! üòÅ

Device: iPod touch (7th generation)
iOS: 15.8.2 Device doesn‚Äôt update anymore, though. | Add YouTube music to Xbox series x please | There are several issues. For example,
1. when you tap on an artist, I want it to take me to their songs in MY library, not their whole discography! (Instead I have to go back and search their name, then tap ‚Äúmy library‚Äù.)
2. No EQ control, though I hear that‚Äôs been present in the Android version for quite a while now.
3. Play count would be nice for artists, albums, songs‚Ä¶
4. they should clean up the mess artists make by having a million versions of a song in different places. They should help the artists have a better organized collection. I don‚Äôt want to add a song to my library when it comes on shuffle, and then realize I already have three of it in my library from single version, album, extended album, explicit album, compilation album etc.
5. Name of the album would be nice to have too, when we are listen to a song. We could tap on it to see the rest of the album (just like tapping the artist‚Äôs name) instead of jumping through multiple steps to finally get to it.
6. When you go to album, it should be very easy to select ‚Äúshow me the songs from my library‚Äù or ‚Äúshow the whole thing.‚Äù | Yes, I know apps have to make some bank somehow, but why can I not play music in the background with YouTube music free? Spotify and SoundCloud both allow me to play music in the background for free, but not YouTube music‚Äîwhich I was interested in BECAUSE I was told it plays music in the background‚Äî. I mean yes, I totally get having adds in between songs because I don‚Äôt have premium, but forcing me to pay for my music to play in the background is something wild. This app does give you like two weeks of premium or whatever it is called, which is nice, but after that you have to pay which is stupid‚Äîwhen it comes to playing the songs without the app open on my screen‚Äî. If YouTube would just change that one thing, I would probably recommend the app at higher points but until then, 3 stars is all I can give. | I was just trying to listen to music but whenever I still have the app open but it just turns off and doesn‚Äôt play my music so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs stupid | Best music platform!! You can find any songs, even the unofficial ones. | M√≠ me ha gustado bastante | Its like being in the club no pause just straight flowing with vibes | I love music in general but how YouTube music packages for the end user, amazing work.
Much appreciated. Lower the monthly though. | Love it the samples are a nice way to find music without searching and looking for hours on end and I love how you can go back and skip ahead in the song unlike some apps, no ads too which is amazing! So far I haven‚Äôt seen any bugs or glitches so yea 5 stars I highly recommend!! | I‚Äôm just glad no commercials 3-4 minutes in. | This is outrageous, They made something free into something that I have to pay monthly. That is being able to listen without needing to be in the app and being able to go to other apps while listening | It‚Äôs so great that I am going crazy | Always&Forever | I'm paying for YT Premium/Music and with every update they just introduce more bugs to make it less usable. Since two years I've not been able to listen to downloads on over 6 differen phones (android and iphones). Now playlists don't allow to play more than 20 songs of any playlists and only allow shuffle - you cant just listen to the songs in the order you added them. It's ridiculous. I hate spotify, but at least it works as promised so I have to switch back next month. Sad. Really sad to see. | First of all they ask for a whopping 14.99 bucks a month  like Jesus why not make it 7.99? Just so you can listen to music while your phone tablet or idk off and for ad free stuff jeez dude | I create playlist so that I can listen to the whole playlist, but every time I try to play my favorite playlist, it cuts out more than half of the playlist. It will not let me play my entire playlist not to mention the fact that it wants to censor every song that it recommends I don‚Äôt wanna listen to censored music, I don‚Äôt wanna listen to censored music, I don‚Äôt wanna listen to censored music. I hate YouTube if I didn‚Äôt have all of my stuff on YouTube I would delete the app right now. | It‚Äôs for the real music explorers. :) | I think we can agree that YouTube is the most comprehensive and best jukebox in the world. I love that you can listen to both studio releases, as well as artist originals, remixes/mashups, etc. 

Just one thing is missing,  which is better control over the audio output: crossfade option, equalizer, etc. | .. enjoying all the improved features, including ease and access to my favourite selections and genres

1600525061,"com.locket.Locket","Locket Widget","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locket-widget/id1600525061?uo=4","Locket is a widget that shows live photos from your best friends, right to your Home Screen. You and your best friends will see new pictures from each other every time you unlock your phone. It‚Äôs a little glimpse of what everyone‚Äôs up to throughout the day.
 
HOW IT WORKS
1. Add the Locket widget to your Home Screen
2. When a friend sends you a photo, it instantly appears on your Locket widget!
3. To share a pic back, tap into the widget, take a pic with the camera, and then hit send! It appears right on your friends‚Äô Home Screens
 
FOR YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS
‚Ä¢ To keep things friendly, you can only have 20 friends on the app.
‚Ä¢ On Locket, there‚Äôs no worrying about follower count, just add your best friends and family and live in the moment.
‚Ä¢ With Locket, you‚Äôre able to be real and share photos to the people that matter.
 
REACT TO FRIENDS' PHOTOS
‚Ä¢ Send a Locket reaction to your friends to let them know you saw their image.
‚Ä¢ They‚Äôll get a notification and you‚Äôll love watching the emojis rain down on your photo.
‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt count or track the reactions, so you can be real and authentic without worrying about likes and filters like other platforms.
 
BUILD A HISTORY OF YOUR LOCKETS
‚Ä¢ As you and friends snap Lockets, you‚Äôll build up a history of all images sent.
‚Ä¢ Share them out as photos or use our video recap feature to stitch together the memories of you and your friends, capturing those ‚Äúlove it‚Äù moments.
‚Ä¢ Locket will also make you a recap video at the end of every month with all of the photos you've shared.
 
ADD LOCKETS FOR YOUR BESTIES AND CRUSHES
‚Ä¢ Decorate your home screen with more photos and images dedicated to your crush or your bestie
‚Ä¢ Add the ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest Friend‚Äù picture widget, and see photos only from that person. Plus, you can send images just to that person too!
 
Here‚Äôs what our users say:
 
‚ÄúI love this app because I get to share cute pictures to my friends‚Äù - HI
‚ÄúAMAZING SO WORTH IT‚Äù - rikkibear29282902
‚ÄúBest app made this year‚Äù - johanjodel_
 
Plus, users love our camera (so you‚Äôll love the photos!) - @sonnielove3 on Twitter even said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sum about that locket camera‚Äù
 
Download the free app! We‚Äôre keeping Locket free so you can send photos to the people that matter (friends, family, bestie, etc.). With Locket, your phone will feel like it‚Äôs bringing you closer to your best friends.

I hardly experience what new social media is like here. There‚Äôs no influence other than that of the people you share your lockets with. | A little hard to figure out but so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è | I think this is a great way to have fun with friends and explore new things ! Great app! | Why do you have to invite 5 people before being allowed to use the app?? Literally just wanted to use it with one person not send texts to 5 randoms | I really enjoy Locket and how it allows me to connect with my friends, it does have a little lag of where it doesnt show someone elses post, other than that I love Locket and I recommend if you want to connect woth close friends!! | Its rlly fun and keeps u up to date with what your friends r doing | Wish I could write more when I what to ad subtitles on my pictures | Please help!! | your app won‚Äôt reinstall back into my phone. and i don‚Äôt know why | Locket | locket is amazing for chatting with friends and letting them see what you are doing!! i love locket!üíù | I can‚Äôt add the widget to my Home Screen can someone help? | amazing love it | Uninstall and install numerous times. No widget appears on widget menu. Can‚Äôt figure how to get the widget to appear on iPhone. | It‚Äôs so amazing and here‚Äôs why
- if you‚Äôre not into being all over social media and everyone seeing you then this is the right thing. They have to be your contacts and you have to friend them. 
- it‚Äôs kid friendly
-you can chat on here just like Snapchat except it is a more appropriate verison | This app is SOOOO fun bc u get to keep in touch with friends and family across the world. | It's a good app but I wish they added filters when you can post pics! | I think the app locket is a fun app. But it is just like the normal messaging app but instead u have to pay to have more friends where on messages you can have as many as u would like. It is also very hard to figure out. This app also will take up a lot of your storage. | I absolutely love this app!!
If you don‚Äôt have it then download it.
I am on it all the time.
It is literally my favorite app rn!!!! | I love locket because it helps me connect to my friends from gymnastics and from school. Locket is similar to BeReal but is way better with how you can post more than one or three pictures. You can post as much as you want, and you can join groups. Locket is so much fun and I love the experience. | Nice app! Wish there were more features for non gold members | This app is a great way to send pics to your friends without using storage! Kid friendly üíØ | Good! | Well, I download it on my home screen. I don‚Äôt have a phone number so when I go into it, it asked me do I have a phone number and I don‚Äôt so it wasted storage in my iPhone And it‚Äôs just a waste, so yeah if you don‚Äôt have a phone number don‚Äôt use this app but if you do go on | The widget has been stuck on the same picture for a months even though my friend is sending new pictures.. not really what it's intended for | Locket is so slay I love it like slay it is so preppy I luv it | I AM MAD | i really like this app but there are some things i don‚Äôt like like on the video has no sound and you have to pay for
things that are just nice to have | Do not understand the reasoning of HAVING to add 5 people to use this app. | I love the idea of this app. I planned on using it with my long distant girlfriend just as a personal thing between us two, but that is not possible with the way the setup works. You are required to invite 5 people in order to make an account, which I think is not very fair. I get it‚Äôs trying to be a messager app and spread the word, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to force the people who download your app to do your advertising. I‚Äôm not a billboard. | i‚Äôm just trying to send pics to my long distance boyfriend I don‚Äôt wanna send it to 5 people in order to use the app | Love this | Would not let me have more friends only when I have five friends | Love it so amazing | So this is a short review. This would be five stars but I have a little problem. So, when I take pictures, most of the time their blurry. It‚Äôs kinda annoying bc I want a clear picture. But anyways, that‚Äôs my only problem. That could just be my device, but I don‚Äôt really know. | It gives me opportunity to play with friends | Basically BeReal but without the time limits. | This is a very good app | I think that when I send a picture I should be able to delete it (and texts) | I love locket, it‚Äôs a really good app to find friends.5/5 is my rating forever | I rate this a one start because my locket resets most of the time but the app is good but it just restarts please fix this . | I love this app but I think it needs some improvement. The videos could be longer. There are just lot thing that need to be fixed. But other wise I love this app! | This app is so fun and convenient my friends and I have this app and I love them sm and now I get to see their photos on a widget | No ads, free, and you get to share photos to your friends! | Best dang app out thereü§™ | Very fun and kid friendly | My mom is over protective so i don‚Äôt get a lot of things like this. This is the closest thing I‚Äôm going to have to social media till i move out and so being able to make contact with my friends with photos and videos is amazing. The one thing i think that could improve is the fact that there‚Äôs not any filters. Having filters would make it so much better eve. though its already amazing. | I love this app and it is so fun because i can socialize with my besties! One thing tho i need more longer videos. | ITS AMAZING 100% RECOMEND√â  ITS THE BEST APP EVER (not better then Tik tok tho)",4.76105,302160,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d0/d7/da/d0d7daa3-0442-c1d3-553d-6b2b93ced4ec/e04eef77-f55f-413b-988f-5cd68761cb44_screenshot1old.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/04/d3/8a/04d38afc-30c6-ce89-7256-550a4ea4c4a3/26b31fa8-4ae9-4413-b4bc-08bf1eded094_screenshot2old-real.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/31/40/e6/3140e643-e3dd-5ae5-2c7d-8d155e05382b/7fec781f-09e3-401d-a6d7-3d2e4a016724_screenshot3old-real.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d4/a6/1b/d4a61be3-baa5-15b0-6a6b-b20fb9bc6766/c8bf0e08-44c4-4989-8fac-edff0966393e_screenshot4old.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/0a/24/91/0a249125-4770-a014-00d1-b41d237475c5/49b101cc-e75b-4ed3-b5cf-0a7581580d4e_screenshot5old.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c6/0d/00/c60d009a-6fe2-5e3b-1bec-5de7159630ad/56d50f54-053c-4631-9eb6-c19afd25e944_screenshot6old.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I finish every workout, I‚Äôm motivated, and I can see I‚Äôm getting more toned. It feels like my workout plans are formulated with thought, and I appreciate that a lot, especially with arthritic joints and hyper mobility. I have options to control my workouts, skipping things that are uncomfortable and more. 

 Buttttt there are some glitches with balancing exercises. I‚Äôve had quite a few workouts where I will only do the exercise on one side. Likewise, I think most users would benefit from some voiced instructions. Example: pull in your ab muscles during a twist, keep legs shoulder width apart, etc. Some exercises could hurt you, and there are no alternatives or modified easy versions. And finally, the price‚Ä¶it‚Äôs pretty expensive for what is essentially a spaced timer. There haven‚Äôt been any changes to the app that I‚Äôve observed, there‚Äôs no weight loss calculator or goal features. I like that it tells me my caloric total for all time, but I think for the price, it needs something extra to explore. I like feeling like I have total control over my workout and the pacing, but I probably will not renew unless the price drops, especially considering there are a lot of free alternatives | I have lost 59 pounds on my first day | Terrible app.  They advertise that it‚Äôs free but good luck trying to do a workout for free.  They just bombard you with purchase ads and then it just stops letting you access any workouts. | I did not purchase this 
Need my refund | I‚Äôve been quite depressed. I often use exercise to help alleviate those symptoms. This time I had absolutely no interest in exercise bc my grief has been overwhelming. 

I downloaded this app out of curiosity. How would exercise while laying on a bed actually work? It does! At first it was awkward I felt like I was just flopping around on my bed. But, I‚Äôve got that very familiar achy post workout feeling and I have more energy.  Yay for floppy fitness! This app is quite fun and you don‚Äôt have to stick to the plan. There are many other workouts to choose from. | This app is helping me get the body i want and all but its not helping me loose wieght. Ive been using just fit for nearly a month and i see that my stomach is getting flatter and my arms dont look like bananas anymore but ive only lost nearly 3 pounds. Ive changed my diet a lot. I eat healthy and all but i cant seem to loose any weight and it was my goal to loose weight and get the body i want, but it seems i am only completeing 1 of my goals. Im 5‚Äô2 and was 170 pounds but i look like im only 120. I dont understand if im doing the exercises wrong or not. I‚Äôve stepped on my scale this morning and ive stayed the same wieght for over a week. | I purchased a year subscription and honestly it has been worth the price. The workouts are quick and provide different exercises to address different muscle groups. The only issue I have is the heart rate checks. When comparing my iwatch rate to the flashlight on the phone it is completely different . My watch says my heart rate it 125 and the app says it‚Äôs 87. That is a big difference. I have tried to change my finger position but nothing changes. | I was really excited to try this. However, I specifically entered that I have knee issues and it says it will customize my workout based on that. However, it did not. Day 1 there were a few exercises that would put much strain on my knees and I cannot do. My understanding was that there would be more chair exercise, hence the Lazy Workout. I think for people without joint issues this would be great. So, needless to say, I am canceling my account. Hopefully in a future version the customization will work better. | It‚Äôs not free so why do your ads keep saying it‚Äôs free? | It wappp | They say it‚Äôs free in the ads, but it isn‚Äôt. They claim they aim for full transparency but don‚Äôt advertise that you have to pay to use the app!! | Was a workout pretty easy for a 67 yr old! | I love this app so much much much much much. But I just can training for three days, and I hope it will be free or sale(sale forever),like if price cost for 1 month is 5$ I hope you can sale it down to 2 dollars or 1.5$ for a month pleaseeeeeee, so I can help my mom work and something else so she can give me reward like 1-2 Dollars. SOOOOOO PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Is the only thing I need to start my journey to loose weight! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è | It was fun however, there were some things I could not do like squats my knees are injured, so I cannot do squats, and I have a problem. I cannot stand on my toes so the heel Lift wasn‚Äôt impossible unless I was sitting down. Let‚Äôs see what tomorrow is like. | I loved the curated exercises in the app. Enjoying it as of now | Please explain why i was charged if there is a 7-day free trial. I don‚Äôt even know if I like the app yet and the ad said this was free app. Which is misleading. I should‚Äôve known better. Back to my FREE you tube videos. smh | Why do your ads say this is free? After a lengthy set of questions I find out there is a monthly fee. Not cool to lie! | This is a great pre workout before work then I go to the gym afterwards already prepared for crunch time | After trying several workout apps, I am sold on Just Fit. The day after my first workout I noticed a difference. With the short 15 minute workout, my thighs felt like I had a good workout. It‚Äôs been a long time since an app has been able to do that for me. 

The app is easy to follow and has the best set up I have seen. I have only done 3 workouts and I am starting to see results. I even had a coworker comment to me, ‚Äúlook at those muscles‚Äù when she saw my arms. 

I initially purchase one month just to try it out but I am hooked. I love the short workouts, the way the app is organized and the quick results. | IT IS NOT LETTING ME CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION AND IT IS NO LONGER GIVING ME AN OPTION TO CANCEL OR LETTING ME DOWNLOAD ANYMORE APPS I NEED TO USE | Constantly pushed to upgrade to premium. Tired of being nickel and dimed everywhere I go | I wanted to do all the workout and until like I had to pay for them that app begs for money for money I hate it mi like 1456 kg | It good | It‚Äôs only my second day. I do not work out at all I am considered overweight and I do have an 8 month old daughter. As it being my second day this morning when I woke up my body was sore and I was surprised because of how easy the first day was but knowning since I do hardly any physical activity it‚Äôs expected. I did pay for a one month subscription and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how this goes and hopefully paying for a longer subscription! So far I enjoy it and have time to do the 30 min work outs. You can pause at anytime so it‚Äôs super convenient | Probably should stop telling people it‚Äôs free. Yes free to DOWNLOAD!!! | This app says it is free while the video is playing and looks like a great app but once you download it you have to subscribe and pay to use | I been seeing the videos stating this app is free and it‚Äôs not. I wish they would be honest upfront then maybe more people would be interested. Just say it‚Äôs a free 7-day trial. | Te explica en ingl√©s c√≥mo hacerlo pero no me salen videos para poderme dejar llevar. Pagar una app por un a√±o y que no salgan videos para dejarte llevar. La explicaci√≥n no es suficiente y despu√©s en ingl√©s. | This was an amazing workout | Every commercial I see in games says the app is free. Free to download then pay when you are in it. Don‚Äôt believe the false advertising. | The app stated there was a 7 day trial. At day 4 the app demanded that I join and would go no further. Talk about false advertising. I‚Äôll be happy to share your inconsistency in advertising. | why do I have to sign in and give personal info!! | I love this app so much it has made me feel so confident in myself and it knows exactly what you need to do‚ù§Ô∏è | I have looked at several apps like this. I would like the cost of it spelled out. Where is that? | When I seen this app on a ad it said it was free and it‚Äôs not. You get a 7 day trial and then after that it‚Äôs ridiculously expensive. So I closed the app and deleted it. | For a stay at home mom that doesn‚Äôt work out a lot I love it I makes me sweat and it makes me fell active | I so agree with the lady Read about earlier I tried to get this app and I did and the two things that I found that were really not very fair is one it says it‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs not the only free for seven days and then you charge $69 for it and two when I told them that I had to do it sitting down or laying down I promise with my knees in my back they said not a problem they would Taylor my exercises to me so that when I got it and looked, everything was standing up, doing squats and jumping up and down, there is nothing about the bed exercises and there‚Äôs nothing about doing it in a chair and I‚Äôm not happy the fact that it wasn‚Äôt free so now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how in the heck to cancel this thing because I am not happy at all. Actually, I‚Äôm very | It‚Äôs only my second day but so far I‚Äôm enjoying the app.  But where is the button for the renewal option? | I thought I had 7 days to decide befor money was owed and taken | In the ad it tells you is free but when you download you choose what you need and gives you a 7 day trial.. lies | Great exercise to get started, but I‚Äôm not self motivated. Need more motivation support and encouragement to keep going. | Like the titleŸ´ I DONT CARE. This app is amazing! I cant believe you guys helped over 150k people! I am only on day 1 and I feel myself getting that 69lbs! Thank you so much! This workout is worth it! | FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. The app said that there was a 7 day trial but charged my account immediately. Additionally, it had it broken down in how much the app would cost monthly. This is false advertisement and apparently this is something that happens to al customers. The fact that APPLE would allow such LIE makes me lose faith in what these apps are offering. This is a scam and I want this resolved at once. I have already requested a refund! | I am really looking forward to using this app, but was shocked when asked if I had any history of injury, that you can only select 1. If you try to select more than 1, it auto unchecks the previous selection. (Example: you can‚Äôt have an injury to a knee and an ankle) | I answered all the questions in the app and it stayed on the ‚Äúcreating personal plan‚Äù screen, I deleted and reinstalled about 3 times and it still stays like that, any advice on fixing it? Has this happened before? | It‚Äôs not free | Good | Nice app but all ads I have seen for this app say it‚Äôs free. $70 a year is not free to me. Unless I‚Äôm missing something. Or you can go in and get part of it for free. I‚Äôm 66 years old I live on a fixed income so $70 a year is not affordable for me unfortunately.thank goodness I figured that out before I paid the

Thank you

And thank you again | I would of given this a better review but when say a word in Greek it most of time comes out as a completely different word. I can say word multiple times and might even come out differently every time. Yes I tried to say it slowly or faster still the same. But if type it it does translate it correctly | This app is very helpful and overall a gift. However, there are many text-to-speak options missing for formerly colonised African languages. 

For example they have Igbo, one of many languages spoken in Nigeria, but they do not have text-to-speak options. 

Naturally someone will say that since there are so many languages, Google cannot get the text-to-speech feature for all of them. 

They will also say they hope to get around to it like they have for other African languages, but sadly the countries which once tried to erase the existence of these languages have long since been fully featured on the app.

There seems to be a prioritising of languages which allows some to be fully featured, while others waste away in waiting with hopes of being recognised by the world, though many taste the use of them on their tongues. 

I hope to one day have text-to-speech for Igbo and many other African languages, but I am tempted to think it would be unwise to wait with bated breath. That being said, I still appreciate this remarkable resource. | So I can no longer use Google Translate with my iPhone 7 because of this change. What about this app required then to not allow any devices lower than iOS 7? | What a great App it is! It is very useful and helpful.üëè I love it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks very much.

Thanks for all the help. | I‚Äôm in Mexico now, ordering things for my next trip. It keeps ‚Äúhaving problems‚Äù | I‚Äôll let you know if and when I receive the product. | Such a great app to find unique and handmade items but I hope you never have to get actual support from Etsy. There is no direct way to contact them and now I keep getting emails to reset my password because the automated customer support thinks I can‚Äôt log in.

The customer support offered is just redirecting you over and over to different articles in the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù Center. | Great for those things you can‚Äôt find anywhere | Etsy is a great app to find unique gifts and items. I love the fact I am buying from small shops and can find personalized items. The app itself is easy to use and it‚Äôs a breeze to make a purchase.

I turned off all the push notifications in Settings and yet I still get some that won‚Äôt go away no matter how many times I click on them. More importantly though, there needs to be an option to SKIP reviewing a purchased item. It asks you to review sometimes even before you receive the item, and the notification won‚Äôt go away. Why do we have to be required to review if we have nothing to say? | Etsy is an amazing place to buy homemade goods from random people. | Love Love the colors and quality! | I can‚Äôt wait to own this gem! | My problem with this app is it doesn't get rid of app notification icons correctly. They just hang out for absolutely no reason. I've uninstalled and reloaded this so many times to get rid of them and then they just keep coming back and staying. Doesn't matter if I'm on my home screen looking at this app or if I'm in the app looking at messages under the ""You"" tab. I have no new messages and it still shows 1 by my messages. Then when I'm just looking at my iPhone screen it shows 2. Smh. Does that all the time.

I cannot click on ‚Äòdownload files‚Äô from an ETSY email.  There are not words for how frustrating this.   When you need help for a problem like mine you must first contact the seller.  Every seller I have asked for help has sent my personal email the pattern.  God Bless every one of these sellers.  It costs the sellers time & it makes me more than frustrated.  Some days all my purchases are right there in the app.  I still cannot get a pattern to download from there though.  Most days some of my purchases are there & others have disappeared.  
ETSY-Please get your site fixed.  And, for the love of all things sold on your site, make it possible for a customer to contact you with a problem! | Making people rate purchases in order to get rid of the red badge notification is such a bad user experience. I don‚Äôt always want to rate my purchases. I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to. I feel like sellers aren‚Äôt going to get back as genuine of feedback when users are forced to rate items. | Thank you very much! | Something‚Äôs that I need for my designs I could find it here. Nothing negative wrong yet with Etsy. | So you can buy replica anything. Like a Spider-Man costume for 1k but it‚Äôs the real thing. I bought a nightwing mask. But also on amazon you can‚Äôt message the seller soool | And dealing with Lance is a privilege. Kudos!! | I do lots of shopping through Etsy!  Cuts my time looking for what I want.  I would not know if these great vendors if I did not have Etsy! | I love shopping Etsy! 
They offer a great platform for shopping all things unique and personal. | Beautiful items ‚ù§Ô∏è | I have shopped Etsy for many years. It is my favorite place to buy unique gifts for my friends and family. The vendors never let me down. The little ‚Äúextras‚Äù they tuck into their packages set them apart from others. Love, love, love.üêå ‚ù§Ô∏è, Kelly | As a seller it is super frustrating to have to respond to many customers per day, sometimes angry customers, that don‚Äôt understand that Etsy hasn‚Äôt made downloading digital downloads a feature of the app yet. I get customers who think I‚Äôve scammed them. It‚Äôs not easy for them to download on their device and they get confused because they bought the item in the app, they think they can access it in the app. However, they have to login on a browser. Please fix this. If you offer digital downloads they should be able to be downloaded in the app. | I have experienced wonderful service from all the Sellers I have felt with through Etsy.  Quick response, eager to satisfy, wonderful rapport.   Easy to communicate. | That is a total untrue statement. When I had a seller cancel my order, because after giving me excuses for a month why my item wasn‚Äôt shipped, an item I desperately wanted to match something I already had. Because I questioned the seller regarding other items I could see online that were ordered after mine but fulfilled before mine, the seller canceled my order instead of just filling it late. When I contacted Etsy, the customer service representative did not help me whatsoever, instead she made excuses for the seller, who was in the wrong. I would say that I will never go to Etsy customer service again and expect their help. I was extremely disappointed, still am. It makes me quite leery to order knowing they won‚Äôt help me. | My first order so will follow up when they arriveüòÄ | Jasmine, the Owner of Athenia Pottery was simply so sweet and courteous throughout the entire design process.

When I attempt to search for game scores on a particular date by scrolling right or left it shows no games. | This is the worst executed sports app on the entire App Store. It‚Äôs buggy. You can forget getting fine details of a college baseball game. Scores don‚Äôt update live. Just a piss poor example of a sports app. | This has to be the most outdated and terrible app known to sports. I think the last time they updated it was in 2000 | You can no longer see the current schedule. It starts in July! FIX IT! | billion dollar company cant make a fast app | Cannot log into my TV provider through the iPad. Very poor customer service as well. I have sent two emails to tech support that have yet to be responded to. Fix this issue as it seems to be a reoccurring theme for iPad users.

It is March 23 2024 and ESPN still has not fixed its app for the IPAD. I can rarely sign into my tv provider. Trash app. Trash customer service. | You can‚Äôt lookup day to day or week to week and month to month college baseball game on app sense last updates!!! ESPN needs to fix this problem!!! The dates above show dates of games after the season is over!!! | You call yourself live sports and scores but you are not. I have a gambling problem and you force a betting tab in my favorites‚Ä¶ bad enough I have to deal with the ads now you jamming it in my favorites and there‚Äôs no way of disabling. Teens use this app as well and just because it‚Äôs not legal doesn‚Äôt me they wouldn‚Äôt find ways to get around it. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs even legal to have just added betting features like that. I also did not sign up for ncaaw notifications‚Ä¶ so why am I getting them? | I just started using it. There is a lot on the app but I would like the ability to add upcoming events to a watch list or some way to get a notification when the event is going to start. You can‚Äôt AirPlay to the ESPN Samsung TV app which is a bummer | Women‚Äôs  ncaa softball game dates say July. Has been like this for a couple of weeks. | The dates for ncaa baseball an softball are not correct anymore. | The app is a fine experience except for its constant need to freeze everytime you open the app. You basically have to sit there for 10 seconds to a minute waiting for the thing to load.

It also has pretty lackluster coverage of non-mainstream sports. I‚Äôm a big NCAA Baseball fan and the lack of team tracking, ranking, or proper showing of scores and schedules is disappointing to say the least. | I actually rarely used the app aside from getting some updates and news about my favorite sports teams.

They decided to offer bracket picks for March Madness, but the app does not work for it at all. | The ‚Äúsports analysts prediction‚Äù portion isn‚Äôt even managed by real analysts and is rather just some fictional pie chart mods create that they feel likes accurate. | üëç | Hello I am a UFC and fan and when I watch the fights after they are over it shows a thumbnail for each fight that gives away part of the fight. The thumbnails should just be the face off before the fight or something like that | This app doesn‚Äôt load content. It‚Äôs not my service or WiFi. No point in an app that doesn‚Äôt work. Which is weird because of how much money Disney has. Idk. | It just spins around and never works | It doesn‚Äôt tell you to update the app.  It just says you can‚Äôt view the content.  It doesn‚Äôt remember teams you watch.  Meaning, you can be watching a game, leave the app, and then when you come back to the app, you have to go find the game again.   You can‚Äôt select favorites for men‚Äôs college baseball teams. ESPN really should do better. | App shuts down randomly for no reason at all. This happens multiple times whenever I am using the app.
Update: I am still experiencing the same problem, with no follow-up by the developer. Crashes constantly. I am reducing my rating to a 2-star. | ESPN has a monopoly on college sports, and I guess that‚Äôs fine, but if you‚Äôre going to take a monopoly at least work. I have to re-link my Xfinity account every single time I try and pull up a college baseball game. And about half the time I log in the screen says ‚ÄúSuccess your Xfinity account has been connected‚Äù but there is no way to exit out of the screen, so I am stuck looking at my ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù instead of actually getting to watch the game. It happens on the Roku app and on the phone app. It drives me absolutely bonkers, and no one gives a d*mn about these reviews, but I had to put this somewhere. | I keep getting notifications on this APP for things I have never set-up, EVER!!!  I don‚Äôt care about SEC Baseball | Tired of this app not working right. Tells me to log into TV provider, I do then it signs me in and won‚Äôt go off that screen. | Great app it keeps you updated on your favorite sports.  Just marvelous. | Trash | I have contacted tech support several times. The first time they said they would look into the issue, the second time I did not get a response at all. When score alerts come through they are changing the position of the team based on who has the higher score. Sports fans know that the home team is always on the right or bottom no matter what the score is. Now today I got notification of the Milwaukee Brewers playing Seattle and Kansas City at the same time. That has also happened with my St. Louis Cardinals scoring and alerts. | I subscribed just to watch live game and it keeps asking me for my TV provider | Every day all day!!!! | I need all the NCAA Tournaments showing!üò© | Speed up the app | I was hook, line, and sinkered into upgrading to the whole ESPN+, Hulu and Disney package because the offers for what is on ESPN + was misleading. You can‚Äôt a lot of what is offered. | I pay for ESPN+ through HULU and I can‚Äôt cast or airplay a game to my TV without ESPN blacking out the game. I tried watching it on my iPhone, but the app kept switching to other games in the middle of the live game I was trying to watch.  I watched for 5 minutes and had 4 commercials play.
This app is useless. | Too many clickbait headlines that give partial article‚Äôs requiring subscription | Where is ESPNnews | Stephen A and other hosts who trumpet the outrage culture of sports is why I left ESPN. Not fun anymore. | I like the ESPN app and use it daily. However I‚Äôm disappointed that I have to pay an annual membership fee (that increased materially recently) and still watch commercials before and after every highlight. I used to be able to watch longer, very nice highlights but now I have to wade through lengthy commercials sometimes for nothing more than a 4 to 6 second highlight, which is then followed by yet another lengthy commercial. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm shopping around for a better sports app. | I left a 1 star review a couple years ago complaining about how it prompts me for my favorite teams each time I open the app, no matter how many times I select them. IT IS STILL DOING IT after all this time. Still so annoying. I‚Äôve gotten to the point that I open the app periodically just to see if they‚Äôve fixed it, not even to check scores. | ESPN‚Äôs Sports Teams and their Players are Flourishing! | For the past couple of days when I pull up the app the date has July  and I can‚Äôt change it to look at previous or upcoming games dates and times. | Great | paid for ESPN+, last year all the F1 races and extras such as Ted‚Äôs Notebook and practice sessions were available.

now it‚Äôll show maybe the race? Maybe one practice session? I also have the ESPN package on cable.

Always been on the Apple TV app.

So, I‚Äôm cancelling all ESPN services, including my cable package.

Also, there are so many levels of legacy business confusion, it feels like it‚Äôs 1987. Each ‚Äúshow‚Äù is either ESPN1/2/3/+/ES, and oh make sure you‚Äôre signed into ESPN and cable provider! I signed up for ESPN+ to circumvent the unnecessary confusion and, ESPN legacy product executive leadership failed again. Trying to solve for 30 different millionaires‚Äô opinions lol. It‚Äôs old business.

Just signed up for F1 TV Pro (10.99$/mo)

It‚Äôs incredible. Can‚Äôt wait for SkySports to be syndicated with Apple. | Yup | Can‚Äôt watch anything despite paying $250 a month for cable. Guess ESPN wants me to cut the cord!? | goog | So I tried to provide feedback without writing a review, the app support link takes you to ESPN.com home page, the contact is link there takes you to an FAQ and searching for the issue provides unrelated results. Since ESPN won‚Äôt make it easy to provide feedback privately, I‚Äôll just provide it publicly. The app crashes every 30s on the dot. I have no idea what‚Äôs happening. That‚Äôs it. App crashes to Home Screen and reloads the home page when you launch. Very annoying makes it hard to enjoy all the awesome stats info scores and articles.

The app needs a bit more work. | This app is amazing and it was recommended to me by my mom‚Äôs nurse. I am recommending it to everyone! It‚Äôs truly changing how we look at food and beauty products. Everything gets scanned! At first we thought it would be super depressing seeing everything we love turn out to be bad for us but instead we just feel empowered to make healthier decisions. I can‚Äôt recommend it strongly enough. | Love this app! The FDA clearly sets the bar very low when they allow products that contain so many artificial ingredients and chemicals. It‚Äôs amazing to compare products with this app to see which ones are healthier- don‚Äôt confuse this for what tastes best! Use it to find what is healthier. Scanning a product is easy and the app will tell you why it is good or bad. It will then give you alternatives that are better for you. Don‚Äôt forget to check things like deodorant, shampoo, skin care, etc. Of everything I used, only my deodorant was rated highly. Had to start over with everything else, but used the recommendations. | This is the best app ever, never realized what a bunch off garbage was for sale in our grocery stores. I do believe this is the first step in fixing our messed up health care. Way to go YUKA, keep up the great work your doing!!! | My partner has health issues and is very sensitive to various foods. This app has made it easier to select healthier food and lotions. I love how the app provides healthier options and breaks down why the item scanned is good or not. Highly recommended. Grateful for this app. | Really love this application. The truth will set you free. Wish I could donate whenever possible. So everyone can have the upgraded version. | This app is fantastic I use it all the time like I can‚Äôt go out without it | I almost ate something that messed with my kidneys. I am so glad I have this app installed. Best app I have ever gotten. Also this helps with being aware of what you are eating. This app is VERY suggested by me. | I love this app. It scans a lot of stuff and it doesn‚Äôt just have to be food. Highly recommend! | I like this app but i personally think that animal food and products should go on here too. Also pop daddy pretzels apple pie flavor are NOT cigarettes so kinda unfortunate i couldn't review them. | Simply wonderful app! My wife and I use it almost all the time! Thank you for existing Yuka | This app has help me make quick and easy decisions. It is very honest and has helped me and my freinds a lot in daily life. | I am so happy to have found this app. I have wanted to make better decisions about my food choices and this app is exactly what I needed. The ease of scanning a product to understand the ingredients is perfect. I use this on everything I buy. The first day we cleaned out many things that contained additives and replaced them with healthier choices. I especially appreciate the alternatives that the app provides. Thank you. | i love this app it is really helpful for what is heathy for my skin | I got to know about the app through one of my friends. Ever since I started using Yuka it literally changed my perspective about everything I see while grocery shopping. The most important aspect is the fact that it has alternative suggestions for bad/poor rated products which I found to be very useful. | I‚Äôve left two one star reviews and they have been hidden. Don‚Äôt purchase this app. | I LOVED this app for awhile now but I have come to notice how some products that used to scan at like a 39/100 are now scanning in at like 93/100 and I don‚Äôt understand why‚Ä¶ also, a lot of these ingredients that I don‚Äôt even know how to pronounce used to actually be honest and say if there was a risk but now a lot of stuff is saying no risk and is in the green. | I thought this would be helpful but it‚Äôs not at all! It recommends so many food with bad seed oils and it lists warnings for sugar (even natural) and small amount of calories. There is no access to the nutrition labels when scanning so you can see for yourself where the rating is coming from. It was very disappointing, I wanted to love it! | I do suggest putting in dish soaps and laundry detergents. That‚Äôs part of cosmetics and people are conscious of what they use for those products. Overall, this is fun to use but also have to take it with a grain of salt when it comes to food. One thing that had sodium was poor but it‚Äôs because it was soy sauce and then an organic enchilada sauce was excellent obviously because of it being organic but it has higher sodium than the soy sauce haha. Which was listed as a negative but I just found it funny. I do give my self a pat on the back for scanning all my kids‚Äô snacks being good or excellent and having 1 poor item! | this is a fantastic app but i would recommend a couple things
1. in the images of the products, it would be beneficial to have an additional image of the full nutrition label that‚Äôs on the back of packaging.
2. on the area where it talks about the sugar content, it should be specified whether it‚Äôs added or natural sugar. one bar lost points for it being too much sugar, but it was all from fruit. 
the app is great already but those would make it perfect! | This app is amazing. I use it to avoid hazardous ingredients. If I‚Äôm buying at the store and I for example see two different bread loafs, I can scan each of them and see whether they have harmful ingredients, so when I walk out of the store I felt like I‚Äôve taken steps to improve my health.

I don‚Äôt think they list ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, which I‚Äôm a little confused by. But the app has a great interface. I even bought a membership today, and I‚Äôm the type of guy that rarely buys premium versions of apps. | I just became a premium member. This app has been a real eye opener especially on food items marked as hazardous. It gives a detailed description of what are the contents in the food products that contain additives that can be harmful to one‚Äôs health. The rating of excellent, good, poor and bad are very helpful. Processed foods typically are not good for our health. Anything in a bag, a box or a can should be the rule of thumb as they are the ones that contain most of the harmful additives. | I‚Äôm extremely please with this app! I am one who reads labels because I want to know what my food has in it. Sadly in the US a lot of advertising on food is false and contains harmful ingredients. this app helps detect what those harmful ingredients are. 

I am obsessed with this app and I now spread the word about this to my law enforcement family. Now I have friends and coworkers scanning away and they‚Äôre please with this app. | Think the same brand of OJ is healthy with and without pulp? I used to, until I found this app!  You would be shocked to see your fav brand of OJ rates as poor without pulp and much healthier with it.  Works on generic and name brand products.  Many products labeled as healthy or assumed healthy are really garbage.  

Great for parents as well as anyone who wants to make healthy food choices.  You can make small changes or big ones to feel and look better! | Loving this app! Thank you! | My girlfriend recommended me this app , and that‚Äôs the best thing she did , because thanks to this app , I‚Äôm done buying bad stuff for my health. Now every time I go do groceries, I use the app to guide me in what products I should use and which one I should reject, thank you guys for such of thoughtful app. Highly recommended! | I got this idea by myself while eating chips eager to know how unhealthy they are
When I searched for the idea on google, I was surprised to see the exact app.
Downloaded it immediately and found the chips I am eating are unhealthyüòÖ
Great way to know the healthy products
I referred my friend and got access to the list
The app is too good | I have sincerely enjoyed using Yuka, & learned so much from having the access to information on products used or consumed.  I have shared the app with 8 people so far, & they are just as enamored with Yuka as I am. | I absolutely love this app!!! Has been extremely helpful when purchasing food or beauty items!! 
 I‚Äôve also recommended this app to friends and family members. 
Thank you Yuka ! üòÄ | I JUST found out about the app and am truly amazed at the wealth of information!!  To see the ingredients in a simplistic way and understand whether they are harmful or not is surely to be life changing!

One of my favorite features is the fact that they give you alternatives to the item you are inquiring about. So very helpful!!

I joined as a member the same day I discovered the app (something I very seldom do) in order to support this company‚Äôs endeavors. Being able to type in the specific name of a product is an added bonus to the membership. 

Good luck Yuka‚Ä¶and thank you for teaching us to be health conscious! üíñ | I‚Äôm naturally a label reader but this app makes it so much easier! I‚Äôd love to see supplements added as an option as well! ü•ï | I love this app and it has helped with my grocery shopping so much. I got put on a very strict diet and this is so much quicker than reading labels. | It is stated it‚Äôs free. After scanning ONE product, I now have to become a member to continue to scan. | Wow!! I‚Äôm very selective about taking my time to write reviews when I feel it‚Äôs warranted good or bad. I have to say been pretty blown away by this app just even on the free version. We scan everything now and I‚Äôm amazed by what I‚Äôm learning. Things I thought were good choices for my family, I‚Äôm coming to understand isn't always the case. I‚Äôm taking the time to read why as it‚Äôs also beautifully broken down into sections completely explain why the choice is good or bad. Thank you to the creator for making such an awesome app! Makes learning about these things engaging. Even if you don‚Äôt wanna learn about the why‚Äôs. Your first shown a score making it super simple to determine whether to make the purchase or not. Highly recommend to learn how to make healthier choices for their family. | For $14/yr, it shouldn‚Äôt have advertising! | This app is making my skincare routine way better! Thank you julie | The app has major connection issues. Let‚Äôs say for example I f you‚Äôre out shopping and not connected to Wi-Fi you won‚Äôt be able to scan anything. It continues to give an error message. I‚Äôve checked for updates even deleted and reinstalled it but nothing fixes it. | Literally thank you so much for this app. Found it on TikTok and it‚Äôs so good and I‚Äôve only used a few times but I think everything is free ( I really hope it is) it gives you really good info üíØwould recommend | Great for looking and seeing if the products you use on your hair and body are healthy/safe. Bad for food this app will basically trigger ed things. | Yuka is honestly hands down one of my favorite apps. The amount of work and effort the creators of this app put into it is incredible. The fact it‚Äôs free is just mind-blowing! I love subscribing and paying them the max amount yearly because they deserve it!! Seriously. This isn‚Äôt some paid review or something either. Me and my fianc√© use this app constantly. He loves to use it when he‚Äôs tryna to secretly buy me some skin care product lol üòÜ and honestly every time I‚Äôm looking at a new product I immediately go to use this app. Seriously 10/10!! ü©∑ü©∑ | They advise to buy their recommended products which is great but no one ever heard from them and no store sell them! So, it‚Äôs not helpful‚Ä¶ | The scan feature as a part of the free app is great. Stay in this area only though if you do not want to pay. I was in another part of the app and clicked on the wrong banner which signs you up for the premium subscription. While signing up is one errant click, unsubscribing is next to impossible. Very deceptive with how this is managed. | I went to organic stores, drugstores and grocery stores, and scanned as many hair products as I could with this app. Apparently, every single shampoo and conditioner out there is bad. I did not find one, not even a one even at a beauty supply store, that said it was good. Although I believe that there are a lot of hair products out there that have bad ingredients in them, they can‚Äôt all be bad. Even the ones that say that they are free of parabens and silicone and all that, Yuka says they‚Äôre bad I am challenging you to list the shampoos and conditionersand hair products that you think are good because I haven‚Äôt found a one on your app. | Itsbthe besy app | I really liked the app when it didn‚Äôt require you to make an account, idk why the dev accountwalled it in the latest updates | Skincare scanner costs | This is a great app for products already rated. I paid for the upgrade and it does not add much. Trying to add a new product is dysfunctional and most often the required photo function does not work properly.   Would
be good to just be able to fill in info from
the label instead  of photo.  Overall it is helpful but many products do need to be added. | I was amazed at how ignorant this app was, I scanned several different products, some that are very healthy and some that are not, and it said some of the unhealthy stuff was more healthy than the healthy stuff. Case in point, I compared several different products. Nature valley roasted almond granola bar vs yes bar salted pecan. The nature valley ranked higher. Despite the fact it‚Äôs not organic, it‚Äôs GMO, has 3x more sugar and carbs. But the yes bar got a bad rating because it had slightly more calories (20) and a bit more fat. Also simple mills seed flour crackers got a low score. But the nut thin white rice cracker got a score double that in the 80s. Despite the fact the rice crackers have WAY more carbs. But again it dinged the simple mills for slightly more fat. For anyone with blood sugar issues, might see that and think the white rice crackers are better when in fact they will spike the blood significantly more. This app is extremely dangerous for health conscious people. Everyone should do their own research instead of relying on the recommendations of other people who do blanket one size fit all recommendations for them. The final nail in the coffin came when I was comparing some nutritional products that contain stevia. And it said it was dangerous according to the European Union, it takes you to a link supposedly talking about how dangerous it is, which is just a link to the website, with no reference anywhere saying how bad it is. And the extra final nail came on some nutritional products saying some of the vitamins were dangerous, when in fact there are several different forms of the same ingredients, whether that‚Äôs animal, synthetic or plant based, but it doesn‚Äôt differentiate the difference, and makes a blanket statement saying that it‚Äôs dangerous. This is extreme misinformation. I don‚Äôt know how this company hasn‚Äôt been sued yet. If you want to have a laugh, go down your grocery store aisle, go to the health food section but also go to the junk food section, and you will be a surprised by how junk food will get a better score than the health food. I can recommend this app as a joke, but I cannot recommend this app for anyone who is trying to improve their health.

Update : I appreciate yuka responding but they didn‚Äôt explain why they claim stevia to be dangerous. To say whether something is healthy is dependent on serving size, has nothing to do with saying something like stevia is dangerous when there is no claims anywhere saying it‚Äôs dangerous. Their reason for saying it‚Äôs dangerous is according to the European Union, where they give a link to the EU website. Which has no reference material to anything. But when you search the EU website you will find how safe stevia is. I have met some people who are basing all their nutrition advice on this app and they are making some really questionable choices because of this app. I don‚Äôt appreciate companies who spread misinformation or out right lies. The EWG is famous for making claims about certain ingredients, based on misunderstanding of current scientific evidence and then making blanket statements for something when things were taken out of context.

This app seems to be doing something similar and still can‚Äôt recommend it. | I wish I could I could edit what I think is too much sodium or sugar and calories because those aren‚Äôt things I worry about that much so I don‚Äôt want it to affect the scores as much as they do | A few weeks ago, I was buying the v8 Pomegranate and Strawberry Banana juice because it showed me an estimate of 60%-80% health in both of them.

They all try to grab you but DK has the most consistent useful boosts. | Draftkings is phenomenal and the app makes it easy to bet | I for three days now have tried to do cash outs when they offer it to me and each time they drop the money when I press the confirm green button. Then today in the Women‚Äôs Tennessee game. I played WIN BY31+ I was winning and DK offered me $183.67 I accepted then DK suspended it. If you push the button it should accept. This app is really trash. When playing casino game it‚Äôs always kicking you out, freezing in the middle of spins, never given bonus. They are cheaters‚Ä¶ | I‚Äôve Made Over 10K Using DK Love It | i try to log in and the app says 18+ and i put in all my info and i‚Äôm 20 but it still says there‚Äôs an minimum age restriction i won‚Äôt let me long in really really stupid app | Easy to use | The best sports betting app out there. Period | I have updated the app, did all the steps required but I am still not getting my no sweat bets. I‚Äôve contacted customer service a dozen times but they just now asked for the Bet ID, time, amount, etc. There is literally like 5 or more which I have not received and considering I‚Äôve placed hundreds of bets, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to go back through all of those just to find $10-$20 worth of free bets!

I just wish they would go through and find these mishaps bc I just do not have time! I‚Äôve messaged them every time it has happened yet nothing has been fixed?? | Gary Trent Jr was ruled out AFTER I made my parlay, he didn‚Äôt play at all, they are not taking him off my parlay like they did with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Please fix asap I‚Äôm abt to win big as long as you guys take Gary Trent Jr out because he‚Äôs injured | Oh how I missed you‚Ä¶any perks for North Carolinians | Payouts are getting slower and slower less bonuses. I can‚Äôt bet If it takes me years to get a payout what a joke this app is. If payout was on time I would‚Äôve won by +3.5 on Bellator instead I had to take moneyline because payout came live during the fight and lost. Officially done with this garbage app deleting it for good they always find a way to screw you whether it‚Äôs corruption or rigged fights good luck to anyone on this app be smart and take your profit and run. | Locked my account after I tried to withdraw my winnings. I‚Äôve sent emails filled out forms did the contact is still nothing. No help no explanation no trying to fix the problem. The worst customer care ever. I don‚Äôt even know why my account is locked it‚Äôs been almost a week. They send the same automated email that doesn‚Äôt explain why it‚Äôs locked or what I need to do. I will not be using betting site ever again | When you never even have a chance I mind as well just give you guys money every week. | I have sent numerous emails to this company about getting my ‚Äúidentity‚Äù verified. It tries saying I have multiple people on my account and that‚Äôs not allowed. Their customer service has sent me a blanket email saying ‚Äúsorry only one person can use your account‚Äù I‚Äôm the only one who ever used it and only one that has ever tried to use it. I can‚Äôt open a different account under my name. I have given up going to other betting sites I would suggest to do the same any issues you do have won‚Äôt be solved because their customer service has no idea what they are doing. 0/10 would not recommend. | Awesome app | Very easy to use for a beginner | I enjoy betting as well as the returns when taking and putting money on app. | Shawty what‚Äôs yo drank | DK is as advertised‚Ä¶. Simple, Secure, Quick and Reliable‚Ä¶. If you win and decide to cash out the money is in your account in about 2.5 minutes‚Ä¶ never had any issues and will continue using them going forward‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve recommended DK to a few others that enjoy watching different sports and enjoy rubbing it in at work if they get a little bit loot‚Ä¶ just keeps everyone engaged into a sport of our choosing. | RTP yea right it‚Äôs a joke | You can win big! | There is just no statistical way that I‚Äôve played this much in the casino and have lost everything lol like not even a mini win. Go to casinos in real life, at least there you have a shot. Positive this has to be rigged in some way, shape or form. Also positive the promotions they put out saying ppl win big is a complete lie. There would be socials around significant wins. The sports book is good though, I win money there. | Instructions say you can toggle dark mode on and off in the settings but there is no option. I visually cannot see white text on black. Need to find a different app I guess. | Dah where is it? | Thanks for all the DK Dollars | Sports betting at it‚Äôs finest | I‚Äôve referred several of my friends after the app and multiple ads state to get bonuses for referrals. Despite getting people to create accounts and deposit funds they say I‚Äôm not eligible because my state doesn‚Äôt have referral bonuses even tho my app consistently says I do. | Go with DK!!! | Stay away from Live betting on any international sporting events, especially on the app as it has accepted action on bets that have already been decided and you can forget about any customer service to actually make it right. They will say it is because of your internet speed & connection. This has cost me a few hundred bucks and honestly I‚Äôm through with Live Bets. | Worst app ever made my account place my best woke up this morning I can‚Äôt even login in an it wouldn't even reset my password called them, they said I don‚Äôt have a account with them like how can I get my money back Kmt should have listen an stayed away from you guys | Draft Kings is simply the best in all aspects! üëç | Top quality sports book! | Could do better by giving out free bets to frequent betters | I love this sportsbook and the boost you guys offer on a daily basis! | Big winner ding ding | I had my account hacked or it messed up and I had money come out of my account that I did not authorize and it looked like it was doubling the charge with each transaction I‚Äôve had to contact my bank and open a whole new account due to this app and so far they refuse to help with any of it so just be very careful because it was over 3000 and this app is beyond isn't safe and it seems like the betting apps lately have been either messing with peoples account or making it very easy for people to have access to it to take every last penny with that being said I‚Äôve used this app for well over 6 months and I‚Äôve won and lost on the app but I‚Äôve never had anything like this happen before I played this betting app so be extremely careful bc I will never play golden nugget or daft kings ever again | So much better than the rest! Rewards, stats and service! | Draft king is great deleted all my other gambling apps for this app and will stick with this app | Love DraftKings. Thank you | I think you cheat.  But i am to stupid to stop playing | Great | No live dealer black jack is a scam | Great app. 
Always have fun playing within my limits
Constantly offering customer perks and bonuses 
Immediately respond to any concerns 
Great customer service | By far the most Fair and entertaining online casino I‚Äôve ever experienced. 
Top class, five stars! | The app has a glitch when trying to make a teaser bet that has been confirmed by many people. DK support refuses to acknowledge there is an issue in their app so it will not be resolved.

When I look at a game I exit out and I can‚Äôt change from the game menu but over all it is a pretty good app. | Can you make it open two accounts and switch between them easly ? ..please | All I ever get is a ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù or ‚Äútry again later‚Äù when trying to subscribe on the app or the website on my laptop or my phone. It‚Äôs really frustrating having to race to a store before the close to buy a $20 gift card for a $10 subscription. Do better Sony. Do better. | Can you PLEASE allow us to out a cover photo ? | The app has so many missing features and so little quality of life things to it which makes it feel so annoying to use and especially the clip system why can‚Äôt the clips you hav clipped on ps5 transfer to the app instantly why do I hav to manually add a clip to the app ? Makes absolutely no sense when to upload said clip you have to turn on ur PlayStation completely annoying and in my opinion defeats the whole purpose of using the PlayStation UI on ur phone absolutely no thought put into the system at all even Xbox did that feature right do better Sony | perfeeect | Friends love and praise this app but it literally never works properly for me. Paired with console but refuses to let me manage storage, games etc. Half the time it won‚Äôt even show me my game list. Voice chat won‚Äôt connect over mobile data for me. Game & player stats never populate. I‚Äôve uninstalled the app numerous times, logged out and back in, flushed caches, re-paired my PS5 repeatedly but nothing changes. Friends thought I was being dramatic until they saw it first hand in person & we‚Äôre super confused as to how everything works fine for them but nothing in the app works for me. Background, I do app and web development so I‚Äôm not making a beginner mistake here. There has to be some sort of corruption within my account data but I‚Äôll likely never get anyone with enough clearance at Sony to listen, believe me & fix it. | App is trash, takes so long for things to load even when you‚Äôre receiving high speed internet. If you scroll through the store it will eventually crash too. | Cannot open the PlayStation store in the app or anything related to having my PlayStation plus premium membership. Nothing loads. Remind me again what I am paying almost $20 a month for if I can‚Äôt even access the digital library?? I have Xbox too and their app does not give me these issues. That‚Äôs pretty sad isn‚Äôt it? I guess I will just spend my money on their digital games instead of yours. | Like I stated above, I‚Äôm a big gamer.It‚Äôs how I choose to spend my downtime.With no kids and no wife I‚Äôm pretty much lock in on the childhood I never had. With that being said, this app should be doing way more than just showing you your library or showing gaming news on the ps blog. All this talk about AI and future technology I just feel it should be doing way more. Another thing is on the ps store , why are there games to buy one day than gone the next? I find that real frustration cause it seems like as soon as you browse thru the PlayStation store they offer you all kinds of games. But if you don‚Äôt buy them at that moment, than you lose em? That‚Äôs sad. But in all I‚Äôm happy with what I got and my playing time. Thanks! | The new updates look good the app is very nice n sleet but I can‚Äôt see captures at all n that‚Äôs the only reason I really want app | I can‚Äôt even sign in or make an account | I really love this app because it‚Äôs cool and it connects your PS five but one thing that I don‚Äôt like is that it only records up to three minutes and not longer so I‚Äôm kind of mad about that cause I want to make too YouTube vids but the vids are really short | Can the devs just fix the hmm‚Ä¶ somethings missing bug it won‚Äôt let me see certain games | This app is actually very useful. If I don‚Äôt use the store on the console I can simply use the store on my phone. I can wishlist games and even buy them off of my phone. | ‚ÄúI encountered significant issues with the microphone volume in Sony‚Äôs PlayStation App. Whether through Bluetooth or CarPlay via USB cable, my voice volume was barely audible. The lack of in-app adjustments exacerbates this situation. Sony needs to address this problem urgently.‚Äù | The new app sad the servers did not work and i cant sighn in | I guess it‚Äôs it just me because I see so many other people are having the same problem. Cannot log into this app anymore since the most recent update. Get a server error message every single time so now I can‚Äôt access campaigns or anything else. Please fix this problem it obviously is a BIG PROBLEM that everyone I know that uses this app is having plus I saw a bunch of posts about tons of other people having the same problem all over Reddit and other pages that discuss playstation issues‚Ä¶.  Not good at all. I‚Äôm canceling my plus subscription unless this get fixed. | If you click on search results, it‚Äôs guaranteed the app will crash after 4-5 clicks, as it has done for at least 2 years now. I often change my mind about purchases because of it. | I love the layout of the app and it is very easy to use. Overall I enjoy this app but there is one problem. Every time I open the app, it makes me sign in and enter a verification code that is sent to my brothers phone. It is very annoying and when that is fixed, it will be a flawless app. | I can‚Äôt purchase anything on the PlayStation store on this app or online | I love it | I deleted a bunch of apps to clear space and this one not taking Face ID I put in my password then ask for card information I already have my card on PlayStation but I figured whatever I‚Äôll do it again I put the info in it says in red information already added and it won‚Äôt let me download it | DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU COMPOSE A MESSAGE THEN CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF YOUR PHONE, SAY, ACCIDENTALLY, THE MESSAGE YOU HAD CAREFULLY CRAFTED FOR YOUR BUDDY IS ERASED! WHO TESTS THIS APP?! WHY AM I WRITING IN ALL CAPS? | i made a playstation account so i can be in a party with my friends, but then when i try to log into the psn app it brings me back to the log in screen and says ‚Äútrouble signing in?‚Äù | Don‚Äôt even let me sign in anymore | Just mind-boggling that as soon as I add money to my ps account the game that I want only has too higher priced editions which is just crazy | PLS ADD WHERE YOU CAN DELETE CLIPS | I can‚Äôt see my PlayStation stars on the app. | It is not letting me send messages on my iPhone. That‚Äôs the only reason I have it so I can text my friends | the app works fine except that my playstation campaign isn‚Äôt working it keeps saying ‚Äúsomething went wrong. try again later‚Äù i keep buying stuff and get excited for the rewards but every time i try it says the same thing it‚Äôs been going on for a while now | I don‚Äôt have an issue with the app but I have heard that the old Star Wars battlefront games were going to get more support again which fine but I was wondering if you can bring back the legend of Spyro a new beginning to the ps4 and ps5 if you can | I'm so frustrated, it doesn't matter if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks it logs me out, I'd understand if I changed my passwords or reset my ps4 but I haven't and I don't. I just don't understand why it logs me out so much, it's just very annoying really. I'd like support or someone to explain to me what's happening, if anyone could reply or help it'd be great. | I go on there to check my campaigns and it always gives me an error. ‚ÄúSomething went wrong. Try again‚Äù
Updated the app and still I get errors. 
I try searching for games and it just doesn‚Äôt work right. It‚Äôs for the best. 
I‚Äôm not going to waste my time. I‚Äôm going to put the controller down, go outside and play in the sunshine.  Move my arms and legs a bit. Get off the couch and forget those daily check ins.

It won‚Äôt let me remove it Playstation please bro | Hi can yall help me, my app keeps glitching , when I wanna log in its glitches past the sign in screen and then goes right back to the main ‚Äúpress to sign in‚Äù screen , i have no idea what to do. | Consigo fazer login na conta atrav√©s dos navegadores mas por este aplicativo n√£o consigo e nada que tento funciona.

Since I only ever connect with people I‚Äôve met, I don‚Äôt want to send an invite without a note. This seems to go against LinkedIn‚Äôs professed values of, ‚Äúfostering community.‚Äù

But of course LinkedIn is trying to squeeze everyone into $40/mo subscriptions when the platform is worth nowhere near that. | Do not enable 2FA with your phone number in this platform. They never send you the sms code even though the page says ‚ÄúCode has been sent to your phone‚Äù. I talked with their customer support and they never admit it‚Äôs their fault, bug, issues whatever with their sms server and response. You will be given with which I think is a useless options in this case. 1. Upload your government issued id. 2. Sign the document with public seal on it.

Suggestion to the Qa team: Test the 2FA feature perfectly before lunching.

Suggestion to the developer team: 
Learn 2fa from any of the meta platform. If your 2fa not working. Give a proper message rather ‚Äúcode has been sent successfully on your phone‚Äù everytime. | Such a headache to try to use this app and they have made it impossible to navigate settings to manage the never-ending flood of useless emails, push notifications, in app notifications, etc. Of course they want it this way to fluff engagement but user experience is horrible. | The iPad app is basically the iPhone app and displays everything in an iPhone sized window on the iPad when in Landscape mode. Horrible UX. It's easier to use via the browser on the iPad (except that experience is very buggy and requires frequent refresh) | all my teachers are on this app and they literally everything about them on this app, keep up the work üòàüôè | When I first downloaded this app, I began applying for jobs on the website. Then things got phishy and I started getting multiple emails every other day from fake companies or pretending to be a company for job position offers beginning with interviews via ‚Äúchat‚Äù. I had never applied for any of the jobs sent to me before, how they got my information, who knows, but I do know that LinkedIn is NOT safe anymore. Something is VERY wrong with this app/website. Bc there are SO many scams on here, it‚Äôs completely ridiculous! 

I would highly recommend deleting your account (as I have) before it happens to you as well! 

Good luck and stick with Indeed when job hunting! | What the track about you when using the app is crazy‚Ä¶ | I subscribed in November and cancelled it in March. At $70/month I would have assumed I would have at least gotten an interview with it, but didn‚Äôt get a single one using LinkedIn. I‚Äôm honestly not even sure how the features really help. Maybe in other industries it works better (I‚Äôm in UX writing/content design/copywriting) but I have had much more success with tools like Dice or Teal or even just on my own. | I downloaded the app and from the start it is all in Spanish, and all my messages as well as notifications are in Spanish. I don‚Äôt have time to translate everything, so I deleted it! | Gave me the tools to connect with the best all around people  and learn at the same time | –ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –∞–¥—É | The LinkedIn app doesn‚Äôt have the Celebrations section anymore under the Network tab.
 By turning off celebration‚Äôs notifications, that hurts building relationships with your connections. | I can't upload a resume from iphone. | App is so slow in iPhone 15. When scrolling down it just get stuck and after a while it moves. Been like this for a while. | The is app is an insult to humanity and represents the downfall of civilization. The most toxic thing ive ever encountered in my entire life. | To regain access to my account, I was asked to unload a photo of my ID on a third-party platform, which I refuse to do. And there‚Äôs no way to communicate with a support team. The support page offers recommendations that will not help me. | And you'll get many more profile views. Except we'll take your photo and a photo of your ID and store them on our servers and then the process fails because the 3rd party we use to do this process that deals with highly sesitive information is so bad their software fails to read a barcode using one of the most popular phones in the world. 
Every interaction with LinkedIn in the past few years has ended in disappointment. A long time ago I thought maintaining a premium sunscription was not a bad deal. The price kept going up and the value kept going down to the point the mere thought is laughable. | Interesting app for professionals promoting themselves, networking, and learning about passionate, lucrative topics. 

Thought the subscription fee was $40/year..actually it‚Äôs like $40/month. 

I love that it can help you make a mark in your industry of choice, link up with professionals all over the world at events to make impact in your local community, and even help people transition and meet their goals; however, I do not want to continue spending $40/month at this time for the premium edition. I believe the premium edition is more useful for someone actively seeking new employment opportunities for themselves or their staff, but at this time, I don‚Äôt see how it benefits me, yet (for premium access). | Not the same version on my app ? | Allow for removal of suggested posts or topics!! 75% of them aren‚Äôt related to anything I do and the other 25% are people treating LinkedIn like X, TikTok, Facebook, or Instagram. We are trying to connect with business professionals, not become LinkedIn ‚Äúinfluencers.‚Äù | Scams all around this app! Watch out | I had an issue and addressed support and they could not answer.  So I asked if everyone who joins to become a member does so through the security signing up using the app.  I asked this to make sure there were no hacked faked accounts and we are all true LinkedIn signups.  Supports agent refused to say LinkedIn policy does use such security protocol protection and further refused to even say how anyone joins up and suddenly closes the chat ending the conversation.  I managed to screenshot this poor customer service and verification of my protected information as a premium member who is a filmmaker with celebrity contacts that I will not to make vulnerable to theives and cyberattacks. | LinkedIn is the single worst attempt of a networking ‚Äúapplication ‚Äú I‚Äôve had the misfortune to interface with. Both desktop and iOS mobile app and browsers fail to send a single connect and cannot deliver a basic message either. Why would I pay for premium if they can‚Äôt figure out the basic level informatics. The app is the only ‚Äúapp‚Äù I‚Äôve seen that can‚Äôt properly sync contacts as well. If it wasn‚Äôt a suggestion at work, I wouldn‚Äôt use this abhorrent implementation of technology at all. The one one thing Russia did right was banning this app. It‚Äôs truly bottom of the barrel. | This app is useless because it won‚Äôt let me sign in.  It tries to verify me with a CAPTCHA, tells me I was successful, and then responds with ‚Äúmissing or invalid‚Äù CAPTCHA response code error message. | Why can‚Äôt all countries be included in the verification system? | LinkedIn is too big and cannot support its members basic needs in real time. Customer service is non existent and full of self help topics. Sometimes issues need immediate attention and they cannot/ will not provide that service. Great product but poor support and this is what has opened the market to others. | I cannot understand why this app always get frozen during use. | I like the app, but I wish they‚Äôd fix the bugs. I keep seeing I have an unread notification, but when I click on it, nothing is there. I‚Äôve refreshed, deleted and downloaded the app, and I‚Äôve changed my settings. It‚Äôs not an inconvenience, it‚Äôs just annoying. | There needs to be a  way to block entire companies or report spam/scam postings easier on linkedin jobs

At times, half the job board will be overrun with clearly spam postings. This does not even include the high amount of jobs posted that have incorrect requirements and wrong years of experience, making it even more inefficient

 Am about to ditch linkedin as a job board platform because of this | Many functions available in full site are missing in the app. ""Open to Work"" cannot be enabled without a fixed title. Job search is broken. Searching for Java, shows C/C++, SAP, C# results. | There is one major problem with this app. After using it longer than a few minutes at a time, it proceeds to slow down exponentially to the point it either crashes or stops responding. It‚Äôs really not helpful to be crashing right in the middle of trying to apply for a career or looking at media.

LinkedIn treats you like you‚Äôre an insignificant annoyance and provides zero support. Meanwhile they want all of us to post content and build LI into a content juggernaut but they care zero about us. | I‚Äôve been a member for a long time now and my entire experience has been filled with scam after scam, leaving me paranoid and distrustful of every message or job offer I get. Nearly every time I apply for a particular job, someone messages me with a fake profile impersonating someone from the company I had applied to. They then give me a fake gmail (which is an obvious red flag) to reach out to them for an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù that ends up being a time-consuming questionnaire and not a real interview. This happens over and over again, and when I try to report or block the scammer, LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt even have those options. It‚Äôs despicable how many people are waiting to try to scam job-searchers out of a couple hundred dollars. LinkedIn, you need a serious security update. | While the app has been generally fine, it was really difficult to find the page to manage the notifications I received. I was getting too many emails from LinkedIn. The worst offense is that I have hit the ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link at the bottom of the email MANY times, it would take me to LinkedIn and tell me I have successfully unsubscribed, but I‚Äôd continue receiving emails. Either this is an issue with their link, or this is very sleezy business practice to not unsubscribe me that I simply can‚Äôt trust. | But the notification settings really need to be addressed. There are probably a hundred different types of notifications I could possibly receive, and I simply don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to go through each category and make a decision. Cutting this down (or forcing users to opt in to the notifications they would like to receive) would go a long way. | È†≠‰∏ÄÂ§©Ë®ªÂÜäÂ•ΩÔºåÁ¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Â∞±Ë™™ÊòØÊ©üÂô®‰∫∫Ë®ªÂÜäÁöÑÔºåÈÄ£ËëóÂÖ©ÂÄãÂ•ΩÈÉΩÊòØÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂ§©Ë®ªÂÜäÁ¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Â∞±Â∞ÅÔºåÁ†¥ÂÖ¨Âè∏ÊúâÁóÖ‰∏ÄÊ®£„ÄÇ | I‚Äôve been a loyal LinkedIn Pro user for years.

It is constantly freezing whenever I‚Äôm scrolling and looking for new jobs, every time I select X on a job for it to no longer show up, the app acknowledges it and says ‚Äú will no longer show this job‚Äù but yet those jobs are always appearing. Whenever I search for a job with specific keywords the results that pop up are not at all what I searched for. 
I upgraded to premium for sometime and what do you know some of the performance issues were resolved. So why is it necessary to have to upgrade, in order to have the app functioning? | I have used the forgotten password, get the access code and now it‚Äôs asking for Authenticator app code. I never set up the two step verification. Used Apple log in with Face ID from the app still did not work. It is absolutely requiring my government is. Which I refuse to provide. | Tried to login into LinkedIn recently, but they are requiring a driver's license. Not sure if I'll provide it; if they are that concerned about people hacking them, not sure I want to provide my ID. Don't use LinkedIn much, but aside from this new policy (which essentially negates the service), my experience would be 4 stars (not 5, since full site isn't open for free). | I love this app immensely, but there is an issue that when you type an email to the search bar and hit ‚Äúenter‚Äù quickly, it does not except the value in the search field but instead does a search for the last person‚Äôs name that was input. This if very frustrating as it clears out the name that was just input, requiring us to do it once again.  Please make this repair if possible. Thank you! | Linkedin blocked my account for no reason and without any explanation. 

LinkedIn support doesn‚Äôt answer to emails and just keeping silence. 

 This is doubly strange and undignified because I did nothing at all except applying for jobs, no posts, no comments. 

 They just requested my ID to recover my account and instantly sent an automatic response saying 

‚ÄúYour appeal has been denied and your account has been restricted permanently.‚Äù

I called Apple and they said that I HAVE to pay the $30 and they can refund me in 3 to 5 business days. absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!!!! | It‚Äôs not working | Well that about sums it up.

If you do not select the lifetime subscription there was no where to go back to select it before the end of the trial.
ALSO there is a yearly $19.99 AND and annual that is $39.99!! DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. Apple will not help you with this issue. All I wanted was to be refunded the difference because I am not getting any more value with the increased price. This remote is neat in theory but I‚Äôm better off with the FireTV app that is 100% FREE and not deceptive. | Ok?

983156458,"com.microsoft.azureauthenticator","Microsoft Authenticator","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?uo=4","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you‚Äôll be asked for an additional way to prove it‚Äôs really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app.‚ÄØThe OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don‚Äôt have to remember the number. The OTP doesn‚Äôt require you to be connected to a network, and it won‚Äôt drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you‚Äôve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you‚Äôll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/92/55/9d/92559da2-3b24-9a09-5511-c1cd242a5551/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Productivity"",""Utilities""]","[""6007"",""6002""]","Productivity",6007,"4+","[""AR"",""EU"",""BG"",""CA"",""HR"",""CS"",""DA"",""NL"",""EN"",""ET"",""FI"",""FR"",""GL"",""DE"",""EL"",""HE"",""HI"",""HU"",""ID"",""IT"",""JA"",""KK"",""KO"",""LV"",""LT"",""MS"",""NB"",""PL"",""PT"",""RO"",""RU"",""SR"",""ZH"",""SK"",""SL"",""ES"",""SV"",""TH"",""ZH"",""TR"",""UK"",""VI""]","201752576","15.0","2015-05-30T09:25:44Z","2024-03-05T18:38:59Z","We're always working on new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

You can add infinite accounts and keep hackers out. Will continue to use for a LONG time. Thank you for this app, it‚Äôs a life saver. | It will cause a huge pain to make this app work again. This app is required for my work but I wouldnt use it if it werent for. | VisionOS is capable of running iPadOS applications.  In the interest of transparency Microsoft should update customers on when or even if authenticator will be made available on VisionOS.  Is it taking so long due to technical issues or is it a business decision to not support Apple Vision Pro? | Myself and many others seem to run into the same issue with this app ‚Äî you open a Microsoft app to sign in, and it reroutes you to Authenticator saying to input the security key presented to you‚Ä¶ the only issue is: it‚Äôs already Authenticator. So how are we to ‚Äúopen Authenticator‚Äù to type in the key when 1) the app is already open 2) you‚Äôre shown the key but not allowed to type it anywhere? So the question stands: how are we to open the app when it‚Äôs already open? How are we to type in a key when the screen showing the key won‚Äôt go away? I use this App for work and I‚Äôve been unable to sign into my accounts due to this issue and it‚Äôs been causing all kinds of counterproductivity. | Until Microsoft authenticator supports Vision Pro, I‚Äôm completely unable to use any other Microsoft apps. | It‚Äôs the hardest authenticator app to connect. | My Authenticator app is now only show 8 digit passcode rather than 6.  Most of the app I have only will take six digit. How do I switch? | The app is blocked for use on AVP, and won‚Äôt send a link to the Microsoft Auth app on your phone or iPad. This app seems to be going backward. Used to have Apple Watch support and pulled that, doesn‚Äôt support AVP like hundreds of review state. | I am going to initiate a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft for this. THE F-ING APP DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN WORK, yet they force you to use it. How F-ing dare you. | ./night_shift.sh -sync | Let me begin with the cliche I would rate this infinitely lower if I could. I have been an avid and strong supporter of Microsoft for several years; first using it in the United States Navy then School and finally in the professional world, but this app and lack of support is ready to have me retract every good thing I have ever said about the company! I am having an issuing authenticating an account at my school. It is most likely the Schools fault. That being said there is no way to verify this as it is impossible to talk to a Microsoft representative over the phone. It is impossible to access support over chat without logging in to your account! I understand there are millions of problems every single day and it would be difficult for the company to address every single one, but don‚Äôt scale your company to the level that exceeds the volume of problems you are willing to address. Money hungry tech companies where CEO‚Äôs accumulate billions can‚Äôt expend the millions to outsource there trouble shooting it‚Äôs despicable and for the first time ever I am taking the time to rate an app and boy is this one a doozie. Shame on Microsoft may God have mercy on your positronic souls! | Please fix both the Microsoft Authenticator and the One Drive App.  Both are down and affect me from logging in on the application.  Please fix soon as possible | why require the use of your smelly spyware when we already have standard totp apps? why provide the option to add totp after installing this bloatware and then not allow its use? why not do it right, for once, for goodness sake? | I have no idea how to add my account onto my iPad? It should be easy but it‚Äôs not | None of the ms apps work for me until this is done | This app used to work now it is completely worthless.  But what‚Äôs worse is now instead of authenticating it forces me to text myself a code. Making the authentication not a authentication. It has been broken for at least 3 software updates and is a complete disaster for people who travel internationally. | Restores are painful to new iPhone, not easy | Normally I would blame user error, I‚Äôm 27 years old and I‚Äôve worked at a tech company for 4 years. This app doesn‚Äôt provide the code when it‚Äôs needed and I have no idea how to access my email. | In 30 years of IT, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen the rollout of a relatively new technology go so poorly, even by Microsoft standards.
The app works fine for its intended purpose, but the rollout of MFA is so confused,  haphazard, and poorly documented, that it makes us wish there was an alternative OS ecosystem.
Microsoft attempts to force all users to use Authenticator by default, instead of just a phone # or SMS, which has Admins ripping their hair out; and then the convoluted and myriad workaround suggestions by Microsoft support folks only add to the confusion.
Too big to succeed? | Quite often I cannot scan new QR code. Can‚Äôt add a new account. I am blocked. No error code and no way to troubleshoot. I have push notifications enabled. | It would be great if I can sign into my account for the first time without being asked to enter to 2 digit number to not be able to put the two digit code anywhere. I can‚Äôt access my Teams because of this issue. | Awful. Can‚Äôt use any enterprise Microsoft products. Just terrible. | worst experience ever, killing myself later | It does not work every time I try.  I am going to close everything associated with this app.  Switching to Apple away from Microsoft for everything.  Unbelievable | App currently isn‚Äôt allowed on the Vision Pro which means I can‚Äôt sign into my organization since they require this app to be installed on the device. | I've got a couple of different O365 accounts that require use of Authenticator regularly. Frequent (1 in 5 attempts) will fail with various error messages even if I enter the correct number. Over and over again. Kill the app. Restart it. Lather.Rinse.Repeat. 
So frustrating. | Easily one of the worst apps I have ever used. | Seriously? What is taking so long? Microsoft apps are unusable on AVP. | I just struggled through adding a new account. The instructions are unclear, the QR code did not work, and the alternative to the QR code, (which requires tryping out a long, confusing URL that appears on the computer screen into the app) is more or less impossible to do. I had to copy the URL into an email, email it to myself, switch from the Authenticator app to my email, open the email, copy of the URL, and then paste it into the Authenticator and and hope that it worked.

I never have such a dreadful, clunky experience with other providers like Google. | I cannot even get into my school email bc the app isn‚Äôt even working correctly | Very good | Come on Microsoft, get it published for the Vision Pro! | I don‚Äôt understand why this app isn‚Äôt enabled for Vision Pro | I had several accounts set up with Microsoft Authenticator for one time passcode access. My device suddenly died but when I reinstalled Microsoft Authenticator on a new one I discovered that these third party codes aren‚Äôt backed up with Microsoft account and have no way to be restored. Now I have to go to each of those accounts and get special support to circumvent the 2FA codes I can no longer access on my broken device. It‚Äôs a trap. Highly recommend alternatives which have restoration options | Is that a 1, an I, or an L? Is that a zero or a capital O? Who the heck knows?!

Use a better font you twits. | Come on Microsoft, this is ridiculous. Vision Pro support should‚Äôve been there on day one. | I have an issue with the app. I put the authenticator on my Roblox account and it gives me an 8 code digit and not a 6 code digit. I‚Äôm disappointed on this. | 1.1 has been public now. Make this happen!! | T√≥c √îng m·∫ßu tr·∫Øng nh∆∞ g√¨ v·∫≠y?
Tuy·∫øt c√≥ tr·∫Øng kh√¥ng? | They should make this optional instead of forcing it on people. I am now stuck in an endless Authenticator loop where it gives me the two digit code to input but no place to input. I am unable to access my emails from my phone because of this. | A igual que muchos, creo que es la peor aplicaci√≥n y m√°s complicada de la vida. SAN ganas de no seguir haciendo lo que uno ocupa hacer. | I hate this app it never works right I got a new phone tried logging into my school email it takes me to the app tells me on the app to go to the app which I‚Äôm already on and type the numbers I see in but nothing pops up and I‚Äôm already on the app so why is it telling me to go to it so since I‚Äôm already on the app I just decide to press cannot use my authenticator app right now even thou I‚Äôm in the app and it has that option and it still doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm over this thing I‚Äôve missed multiple emails because of it | I need this app in order to log into my school accounts. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to do and doesn‚Äôt let you log into an account (in this case my school accounts) without approval from this app. I had gotten a new phone over the weekend and was unable to access my old phone with the authenticator app on it. In order to log into the authenticator app you NEED the authenticator app otherwise you will not be able to log in. There are options to log in without the authenticator app but those two options only include USING THE APP. I never been so frustrated in my life. I am now in the dark till Monday as my school‚Äôs help desk is not available Sundays. | this app is the worst thing ever. it says i need to use the authenticator app to login while im trying to login on the app. and the code that it says to put in simply never pops up. THE ABSOLUTE WORST | every time I put in my code it keeps saying it's expired | Awful app | It just works. Love the ability to backup your codes and the clean design.

I understand that the upkeep of an app requires money, and this seems like a very helpful app, but its quite unfair to make people pay to understand their own body.  I have very irregular, painful periods, and I am not old enough to have a job, so using this app is out of the question for me.  I do believe that some aspects of this app should cost money, but there should at least be a free version for people who are unable to pay such as myself. | Used flo to track periods and once I got pregnant in order to get any of the features you had to buy a premium . I paid for the year which I should‚Äônt have bc you cant cancel and get reimbursed the remainder of the year.

I also have PREMOM app and did not pay a penny and premom gives soooo much more information each week on the baby. Has basically same features just a different layout. Save your money and get Premom | Hay I have cancelled my subscription for 64.00 n I have not gotten my money back plz hit me back thank you | Every other article that pops up is about sex. I don‚Äôt need vibators thrown in my face every time I log on or some women licking her fingers asking me how my sex life is this cycle. I just want to track my cycle, my sex life is great and I don‚Äôt need their advice. I‚Äôm not coming to the internet to get sex advice, it‚Äôs possibly the worst place to go.

And every time I open the app it asks if I want a premium subscription, no, stop asking. | I‚Äôve lived this app for many years, but as time has passed, the app has been declining in my opinion. Why must we pay for EVERYTHING? I understand that it funds the app and such, but I feel like you could still have premium without needing to lock as much as you do. I only think this because there‚Äôs chat threads and such that you CANNOT read if you DO NOT HAVE PREMIUM. And some of these discussions could really help younger women and women who are still growing and learning about things. Please take this into consideration and try to not have 98% of the app for only premium users. Try 50% or even maybe 65%. I‚Äôm sure you would have much more positive feedback, considering that this is an app for woman to feel safe and talk about things. | Hi, i am a huge fan of the application Flo. my dear lady friend had me download this app so i can see when her monthly special time arrives. it has helped me in so many ways, one being i now know when her monthly special time arrives. thank you Flo for helping me understand my lady‚Äôs ‚Äúflo‚Äù | Impossible to cancel, followed their instructions online and was still charged | I‚Äôve used this app for years, back when you didn‚Äôt have to pay for information about your body and health status. This info is no longer available unless you subscribe to premium. You get push notifications every time you click on the app to log your period, to the point where it‚Äôs beyond obnoxious. You have to click the, ‚ÄùShow me the offer,‚Äù button just to get to a page where you can click off, then you‚Äôll get the, ‚ÄúAre you sure,‚Äù page. The Early Bird Special is listed as $24.99 annual ‚Äúforever,‚Äù but I‚Äôve seen the price as low as $14.99 annual. If you decide to go premium, most of the information the app offers is just a google search away. The Flo app also has a history of sharing user‚Äôs sensitive health information with marketing and analytic firms, including Facebook and Google (according to FTC.gov). There‚Äôs also some concern among users with apps similar to Flo that collect user‚Äôs data about pregnancies that their data could be used against them in future criminal cases in states where abortion has become illegal. Im not sure if Flo has participated in this, but they‚Äôve used our information before, so who knows? Save your money on this one. Flo is not for women. Period. | This app is helping me in ways I never knew | I got charged TWICE in the matter of 3 months for a something i never subscribed to! i only have the app so i can track my period idc about the other things so i didn't want a membership next thing you know im getting charged $59.99 TWICE for no reason? and i been trying to contact the app but no help I'M extremely upset i need help!!!! | My girl recently started using the app to start tracking her cycles and what not. We‚Äôre a long distance couple due to college and she informed me that there was a feature where I could be added. However it costed $$. I don‚Äôt usually mind spending the money if the cause is for us. I just wish as her boyfriend there were more features on my side for the price I paid. I just get tested on basic female knowledge and get told stuff I already know. And even at that, some of the recommendations are things I‚Äôd need to do while I‚Äôm with her. It‚Äôs a good app don‚Äôt get me wrong, I just wish there was a little more to it for the boyfriend aspect. | I used to love the free version of this app because i was able to track period changes and see the length between my periods, etc. Now I can't so the app is basically useless to me. I need this important information because I have endometriosis. Will be switching over to different apps. | i love this app, as does my partner, however we both feel as though there should surely be more features added for the price. after reading all the articles and completing all interactives, theres really not much to the app at all apart from others. i truly hope to see some great/striveful efforts and improvements to the app, as a paying customer. Depending on what updates come till 2025, i think this will be my last year using it, but truly for anyone or couple as beginners trying to delve in and keep track of this stuff, its a great app and it teaches you along the way :) just needs some more hard work on the developers side is all üòé | I use this app to know when to expect my period but the constant full screen popup pushing a subscription is crazy. Instead of promoting it‚Äôs just pushing me to look for a different app. | The constant pop ups and daily notifications about things I don‚Äôt care about drive me insane. And you can‚Äôt turn them off. So annoying | Very time consuming to find the cancel subscription option. The actual app makes you buy everything. Complete waste off money and time and is a Huge Rip off. | I had this app for a while and I put my age above my actual age. I commented on a post that I was 12 years old and I got a pop up from Flo saying they were kicking me out but they didn‚Äôt kick me out so I thought it was fine. Then now it‚Äôs my period again and I‚Äôm trying to know if I still have it but at this moment they kicked me out. Some people have to realize people under 16 have their periods too and need a way to find out when it‚Äôs coming and what is going on with their body. Honestly I think I‚Äôm going to leave this app and go to a different one. I don‚Äôt understand why Flo did this. | I would recommend anybody to flow they told me when I was oblation and Guess What I‚Äôm Pregnant üëèü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ | I hate that their premium option pops ups all the time and instead of being about to click out of it I have to click to sign up and then exit out of it. I don‚Äôt like how all of the the features are with the premium. I would like to see some of the features included or a few of the articles be free each month. they could get sponsors or offer discounts /coupons from sponsors to try to get more revenue. | I don‚Äôt know how something could be so off. Every month for 3 years i‚Äôve logged my cycle. still off by weeks at a timeüòë | This app used to be awesome before they started charging you monthly for it???!!! Like there‚Äôs not a free version just to track my period? Lame! | I‚Äôve had this app for about 1 month. Just about 6 months ago I started my first period. I wanted an app that could tell me when i my period could possibly start next, and made sure my schedule was healthy. Flo does offer those services, but you have to pay to get the whole information you want. Basically every thing you click on you have to pay for. Which I understand but some girls don‚Äôt have the money to pay for that. The prices aren‚Äôt bad but my parents aren‚Äôt going to pay that for me. Which is to bad because Flo offers TONS of different things on the app, but at least 95% of it is stuff you have to pay for. I‚Äôm just trying to say that everyone should be treated the same even though some have more money than others. Especially girls on their periods. So if you don‚Äôt want to pay to know about your period I would recommend getting a different app. | I had the paid version and it‚Äôs truly not worth it. You get access to articles you could easily google yourself. The constant ads are so üôÑ. Literally just want to see how many days before I bleed again. | The only annoying thing about the app is paying for every little thing you click on. The only free thing you can do is track your ovulation week and period week which is the main reason why I did get the app but for other women, they are tracking stuff you have to pay for which is annoying. | They‚Äôre customer service is so bad. They will not get back to you ever | They make you sign up for a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù but still charge your card anyways and when contacting support they only send an automated email. 

I tried following the steps and canceled my account immediately but they have not credited me nor have they responded to my emails. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! | Ladies, don‚Äôt rely on this app when wanting to start trying for a family. I guess I just assumed since I‚Äôve been logging my cycle for 2 years on the app that it would get my ovulation days correct. It‚Äôs been getting my ovulation days wrong for the past 5 months. I know it‚Äôs not their fault but don‚Äôt rely on this! Other than that, I‚Äôm a premium member and appreciate it for what it is and being able to track my cycle. | i personally think that most of these things on this app cost money and i think that if a person who has just got their period and needs hygiene help they dont have about 30 dollars per month.. or if they need a little tip on what pad they should wear or about their cramps. its all only for subscribers. | I love using Flo, the best app but I have subscribed for premium but I'm not able to access it. | Wrecked the app when they updated it & you can‚Äôt track BBT to the 2nd decimal place so literally what is the point of tracking it then‚Ä¶? 
It defeats the entire purpose! 

Also they took about 7 months of my data & just deleted it without my permission when they updated the app.

I spend half the time looking how to log stuff & wasting time trying to use it now. I have no idea why they would ever make such a drastic change in the app as it is now completely un-user friendly.

Today I literally spent about 5-10 trying to figure out how to log that my period started, and I seriously still can‚Äôt figure it out.

The old app used to have so many good features‚Ä¶ If I can‚Äôt log my period - it‚Äôs absolutely useless to me. I deleted the app just now. 

Would NOT recommend. | I have used this app since college and it has always been on point. Th one downside is the constant push to pay a subscription to unlock q/a‚Äôs, but I do not want to lose my progress soü•≤ | Disappointed I have to pay for a period tracker app I always thought this app was free because women always talked so well about it but what‚Äôs so great if I not have to pay to track my period ! I already pay for feminine products | Flo is a decent way for me to track basal temperature and symptoms throughout my cycle, but I‚Äôve found its cycle predictions to be inaccurate. I appreciate that it collects and graphs patterns of my body in a way I can see over time. However, the app consistently thinks my fertile days are at the end of my cycle, and predicts my period many days before it should start. I‚Äôve logged 5 months of data, including period start dates and ovulation time, but this has not yet affected the predictions. Luckily I‚Äôm 33 and have had a consistent 27-29 day cycle for years (and three pregnancies), so I know these predictions are inaccurate and can make my own calculations. It is frustrating though to have to look at the calendar Flo provides and know that it‚Äôs all wrong, and have to do the math in my head every time. Isn‚Äôt that what the app is supposed to do, at the most basic level? It is also frustrating to be fed articles about why my period is ‚Äúlate,‚Äù when it isn‚Äôt late at all. It‚Äôs unnerving, even though I know better. The somewhat condescending tone of the articles in the app, along with the poor timing of their appearance, is the most bothersome part of the user interface. It would be helpful if there was a way to override the algorithm to make your own cycle calendar if needed. | I used Flo throughout my first pregnancy 2 years ago and loved it. I paid for it again this time around but it is literally still on all about tracking my period. Nothing about baby! Insights are all ‚ÄúDealing with PMS‚Äù, ‚ÄúAm I still pregnant?‚Äù, ‚Äúvaginal discharge‚Äù. Hello yes I am pregnant! I don‚Äôt need stupid insights that are irrelevant. Nothing to do with pregnancy or baby info. I updated to pregnancy tracker and nothing. Extremely disappointed. | I downloaded the app from the App Store on my iPhone. I realized a immediately I did not want it, and did not even set up an account through the app or anything. I went to my settings to my subscriptions, and the app was not there, so I did not think I had started the free trial, considering I never set up an account. 
 My mother passed away in February so I didn‚Äôt even realized I was being charged for the app until my bank account was overdrafted in February. I have sent so many emails to get this taken care of and to get my refund and I always get a generic response back. They told me if I purchased the app on the web that I would have to go through the web to cancel my subscription, but I purchased it through the app on my iPhone, but I still went on the web and canceled my subscription. I WAS THEN CHARGED AGAIN in March for the app. I have been charged $75 for an app that I never wanted and nobody seems to be able to help me. I received MANY emails saying they would look into it, but NOBODY has reached out or even attempted to help me. I keep getting email responses from Agatha Answers telling me how to cancel my subscription but nobody wants to address the fact that I‚Äôve been charged $75 that I don‚Äôt have. They think it‚Äôs some kind of joke and funny to completely ignore THEIR CUSTOMERS. It is so unprofessional! Do not download this app because they think it‚Äôs funny to play games with people rather than taking time to address their issues and  refunding them their money. | I like flow it helps a lot but I don‚Äôt like you need to become a Flo member to learn more about your body and symptoms it should be free | I used the flow app in combination with clear blue easy ovulation testing sticks and got pregnant right away when I was ready. I believe it also helped me not get pregnant when I didn‚Äôt want to before my husband got a vasectomy. It now helps me prepare for my PMS hormonal changes.  Great App. | I‚Äôve been using the app for 2 years, of course the only thing I can do so far is track my period.
They charge you for wanting to seek other resources within the app, and basically anything you  click on. 
Resources like app this should be available to all women despite having to PAY for an AI bot that chats to you regarding common period concerns. | Horrible to try and cancel | Great app but I hate that I have to pay for everything. I would just like to know more about my body without needing to tie a cost to it. Additionally, the app does not allow me to make payments because of my region, which makes it more frustrating. | Why are there so many pop ups for the premium subscription? It‚Äôs so annoying and makes me not even want to use the app. If I declined it once already don‚Äôt ask me about it three more times in the span of five minutes. | I‚Äôd like to like the app but the sheer amount of ads makes it difficult to use efficiently and easily. Everytime I open the app I have to figure out how to close the ad that covers my entire screen. It constantly pops out and when I try to click out sometimes I miss and it brings me to the subscription page. So annoying and impedes on usability. | It's total money. You can't access to anything here without money plan. I like free apps. | When I started using the app, it was nothing like this, prompting to get premium subscription. If I knew it was going to turn like this, I would have recorded my data in another platform, and now it‚Äôs too much effort to do so. | The ONLY thing you can do on this free app is track your period so don‚Äôt pay attention to anything else it tells you.  I open the app a few times a month and get no less than 3 pop ups every single time asking me to upgrade to premium.  It‚Äôs annoying and a jumbled mess of stuff I can‚Äôt use. | I use flo because it makes it easier to track my cycle but, everytime I open the app to do a quick check it turns into me waiting for the subscription pop-up to go away and it wont let me x-out unless I click it as if i was going to subscribe. :/ kind of an annoying feature. | I used to use this app when I was in high school and loved it! Now, 10 years later, my husband and I are trying for a baby and so I went back to the app. Why would I pay $60 a year for this? Sorry but no thanks. | I just downloaded this app and I‚Äôm sure it works great, but the incessant pop ups and nudges to go premium are so intensely annoying that it ruins the experience. Every wrong click comes with a disruptive pop up. It‚Äôs tricky to tell what features require a premium subscription (it doesn‚Äôt look grayed out or locked or anything), so clicking around to explore the app is clunky and disappointing. By now I know there are no useful features with a free version.

I can‚Äôt imagine how disheartening this would be to a kid trying to understand their body and looking for a reliable source of information. especially right now. A kid who doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking their parents or simply can‚Äôt afford $60 a year. 

I was excited about the various features of Flo, but honestly I don‚Äôt need anything too fancy. I miss one time purchases, or at least of stripped back but polite and straightforward free versions that didn‚Äôt hound you to pay a monthly fee. | You guys should make it so that our partner are also able to view our calendar instead of just the page telling them when our period is coming | I would love, LOVE to open this god forsaken app without being bombarded about upgrading to premium the second it opens. Even after declining it still incessantly pressures you to subscribe to premium. Flo used to be my favorite but being hounded every time I open the app makes me dread opening

Thanks Shazam! | Shazam could not identify music playing in Apple Music. And that says a lot in that Apple owns both software applications. Does Apple care if their own overlapping software even talks to each other I wonder? This is not seamless with either iTunes music nor Apple Music. And although it will identify music, it will only show up in Apple Music and not in iTunes music. So you are unable to purchase it. And they are unable to recommend music based upon what I have Shazam'd. I would have expected better integration with other Apple software. That is why you should save to Spotify as they give you better recommendations. Then use Spotify to search for like music. Spotify does a fantastic job at that. | Lately I‚Äôve been Shazaming songs and the device is clear especially if I understand what the artist is singing but Shazam can‚Äôt seem to identify the songs. One song was wrong three times. I don‚Äôt know the name of the song, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm Shazaming it. Is something going on with Shazam? Tweet it please | If I could marry a piece of technology, it would be this app! I am in love with this app! | I downloaded this after the iOS embedded version failed. I tried multiple ‚Äòlistens‚Äù to the same song and it came up with different songs each time!

I literally use this any place around the world !! | This is the best music identity. | Absolutely amazing | It‚Äôs always so cool to be able to identify music from my past and enjoy it. Shazam makes it easy! | Thank you | Love it.!!  Always a touch to find information on a song, then download. Best thing ever !!!! | I have been listening to a song for months but I needed to fine the name to it and you helped | Use it all the time | I have used Shazam for many years and hardly came up repetitive failures if it to finds songs. In the last several months, this is the norm. Out of ten songs I could say lately Shazam finds 3 and these are usually known artists. It may have to do with the original company being bought out if I recall and hence the app quality is dropping which is sad. | 009 | This app it tells you the correct songs and I just love it because I don‚Äôt have to know the lyrics to song to know what song it is and I love having not to do that because when I have to look up the lyrics to song it gets super annoying and this is so easy. I just click on the Shazam app and then I get my song, sad some of my favorite and like if it‚Äôs playing on my bus in my car in the mall I want to know what song is playing if it‚Äôs good and if I don‚Äôt know what song is, it‚Äôs gonna really annoy me for the rest of it, and this really has helped me to get the right songs | Use it all the time for different bars playing music I haven‚Äôt heard in years to get the artist. | Has saved my life!

It just stinks. Hinge and Bumble are way better. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money on Tinder. | Deberian actualizar la aplicacion para poder traducir el mensaje ahi mismo en el chat. | Even when I‚Äôm able to identify the bots and avoid them, I end up matching with them anyway. This happens constantly. | Tinder used to be a place to find someone for any reason. Now they keep everyone separated and expect you to pay lots of money to maybe get them to show you as a match to people. Tinder doesn‚Äôt want you to find someone, it wants you on the, swiping and paying. That‚Äôs why they sell year long packages. | I have been using tinder for 4 months now I haven‚Äôt get match and I paid for platinum | Can‚Äôt even send a basic message 
None of the features work
Full of scammers and fake profiles | I hate apps that pose to wanna help you find love. They give you a bunch of random likes just so you pay them money for a shot at a match. But once you pay then you only get 2 likes over 2 months. | Fake women
Alll day nice why pay for it | Says I have 30 likes but after 2 months I‚Äôve seen a total of 1 of them. Tinder has gone downhill fast and the creators of the app seem to not care at all. Tinder is the bare minimum when it comes to dating apps. Bots every other profile, fake profiles, dudes using the female Snapchat filter to make fake accounts, honestly this is the fakest app in the App Store. I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time doom swiping for hours only to never get any matches. This app is broken, they take away all the useful features like secret admirer, please throw tinder in the garbage and walk away. | Prove to your customers that you actually have value!!! So far, you have not. What are we paying you for; no matches? (Rhetorical question) | Waste of money. Never every be a fool and pay. They lie to you on a plan and ince you pay, they take the money and they offer few options for free and the rest they keep aksing you to pay for more. This app is a fraud and app store is promoting its rate also, 99% of users they don‚Äôt respond and they look like they‚Äôre old users or accounts. Never pay. My rate is 2 starts üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé | I shouldn‚Äôt have to verify I‚Äôm a human every time I open the app. 
I shouldn‚Äôt have to verify my identity every day. 
And I definitely shouldn‚Äôt be dealing with my messages not being able to send. Super annoying. I‚Äôll try a different app. Death to Tinder. | Whatever you do do not send them any money, the app is just a money pit. There are really no good matches, most of the profiles are fake, and in order to get matches, you need to continuously buy likes and buy boost. You‚Äôre better off, trying to meet people in person, Tinder, and all these dating apps are all money pits. Do not invest in any of their apps. | Too many scammers already trying to avoid them you got these people who make a profile leave their social expecting followers if that comes up remove them have them figure out another way to promote instead of wasting peoples time and money for their content and not a night out | I am frankly stunned that this app has 4.1 stars considering that virtually every review is negative. 

Tinder as a company does not care about helping people find a partner. They only care about squeezing every last bit of profit out of their consumers as is possible | Y‚Äôall banned me for no reason | Es bastante pr√°ctico conocer personas locales como a distancia es excelente | There are an overwhelming ratio of scammers to real people. You just quit reporting them because they‚Äôre so manny. Don‚Äôt spend your money on these dating apps hoping that the person that likes you is real, because most likely they‚Äôre not. Just go off by matching. My experience with the dating apps have been nothing but disappointing. | I created a profile of my own as my wife and I have an ENM relationship. She has her own distinct profile, and I have my own. In seeking my own and our partners, I was banned less than an hour after purchasing a subscription. Of course, Tinder doesn‚Äôt give a thoughtful review and is all too eager to keep your money. | It won‚Äôt let me delete my account! I‚Äôve tried several times and it keeps saying try again ! | I‚Äôd rather drive off a cliff with a self driving Tesla than to use this garbage money hungry app ever again. | My Tinder matches have been disappearing recently. The app is glitching hard | Creates a very slow process of meeting people. Often have to wait days for responses. Interest fade quick and connections fail. I have yet to meet one person using this app. | I find it hilarious how I‚Äôve paid for this app for a year, got a like about once a month. Met scammers and bots. The moment I stop paying for the app I‚Äôm getting 5-10 likes a week. They are either holding back the likes so you stay on the app, or falsely giving you likes so you will pay again to find out who they are. | The app will unmatch and delete messages making it so you have to pay for subscriptions‚Ä¶..and ultimately stay on the app forever | I was permanently banned off of tinder for ‚Äúviolating terms and conditions‚Äù so I decided to go and read through all of their terms and condition just to find out I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong I asked customer support if I could please get unbanned and they all said the same thing basically that they won‚Äôt unban me when I asked what rules did I violate I received no answer I thought tinder was a good app but the fact that they‚Äôre so unwilling to help you is deeply concerning | I have never used tinder in my life, so within the last year, I tried and used my email and phone number and it says I violated their policies/etc ..but I have NEVER USED TINDER. So i‚Äôm like how can i if I have NEVER even tried tinder in my life? I hear good things and bad, mostly good but still how can I be banned when I have never had access to tinder before? 

-???cluelesss | I got this app to socialize and yet every single message refuses to send. The agreement made by downloading the app gives permission to access my personal information and this is expected to be in exchange for use of the app, exchanging ‚Äúgoods and services ‚Äú is a time honored way of commerce, yet in exchange for my information I am receiving nothing. This is equivalent to identity theft. Fix this issue. | I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve comeback on this app and uninstalled, then install it again. I don‚Äôt know why but there‚Äôs always bots and scammers on here like me and try to message me. Please do a better job of deleting these scammers. Another thing is, I‚Äôm trying to match with females preferably, but why am I getting likes from guys and LGBTQ individuals. I‚Äôm straight and I only want to be matched with females!!! I‚Äôm not satisfied with this app so this might be the last time I used it until everything gets settled and better for this app. | It‚Äôs mostly all SWers trying to get clients for their OnlyFans. They‚Äôve invaded the platform and you can‚Äôt actually meet people. As time goes on it gets worse and worse. Not worth the download. | Noticed you only get likes when you can‚Äôt see them. Half the matches are onlyfans promoters or woman who just want money for sex. Not worth it | If you‚Äôre cool with spending $50 a month have fun! Otherwise you‚Äôre absolutely wasting every second of your time. Not what it used to be. | and no button to appeal. | No way to appeal or find out what the violation was on my account I had before.
Update: 3-21-24
Still garbage that you can‚Äôt even send me a viable link to appeal why my account has been closed. | Sounds like I‚Äôm not the only one unfortunately. Banned for no reason and no explanation given. Only customer service is different people reciting the same verbiage over and over with no explanation about why the ban happened. | Tinder is racist against white men, tinder needs to be investigated as a terrorist organization, it‚Äôs radicalizing the entire female population and lonely men are funding their own destruction and treatment as second class citizens. It won‚Äôt matter if you pay, platinum? What a joke, Tinder will match you with scam profiles that try and steal your money. The damage Tinder is having on the female population is unrepairable, Tinder is why I vote conservative and trump for 2024, may trump bring you liberal social democrats twice the pain and suffering you have brought good conservative men. I‚Äôm not your bank account Tinder/egirls | Boosts barley work, every time you get a like no one will respond to you. The fact that you have to pay just to see who liked you and 65% chance they are a scammer is beyond me. | Do not even try to appeal. You will be banned. If you‚Äôre pretty, people will think you‚Äôre a bot.  Sad these days how tinder is actually trash. | The app is full of fake profiles and the age filter constantly shows people younger than my preference. Distance filter doesn‚Äôt work well either, profiles pop up that are over 1000 miles away when my distance is set to 20 miles.

I get notifications that I have a new match or a new message but when I open the app to check there is nothing. Pretty sure they just send fake push notifications to keep ya swiping. | I was banned because someone tried to hack my account.. | Not enough matches too much of a waste of time and then when someone likes me you keep me from seeing them and it is blurry give a guy a chance or I‚Äôll never pay of go on here again | Not only is Tinder aware that the majority of their female accounts are bots, they themselves, tinder, has a team that creates the bot accounts. These people are criminals plain and simple and there should be a class action lawsuit against them

Edit: can‚Äôt prove it, but I am almost certain Tinder AI generates fake female accounts in real time | Cannot cancel my subscription before deleting account I don‚Äôt want to keep paying subscription bills and there should be a settings button on iPhone on the app | At least half of the profiles are fake, almost nobody takes it seriously or has any intention of following through with a worthwhile relationship, conversations stagnate nearly immediately because there‚Äôs an illusion of unlimited choice. Can‚Äôt think of anything worse for the dating scene than what this app has done socially. Pricing is absolutely ridiculous and the experience on the free tier is severely limited and clearly designed to force users to pay an outrageously expensive subscription fee for a very low quality service. All of the used-to-be free features are now in-app purchases. Society would be better off if Tinder didn‚Äôt exist. | It seems nothing new has been done to protect  transgender individuals being reported without cause. 
I choose to be transparent with such information within my profile. 
I have no control over another's ability to read. 
Per usual, my account is frozen!
I have paid for a subscription to which I now have no access to. | I created an account and paid for subscription the next day my account get suspended I submitted photo verification for review and it‚Äôs been on review since then I want a fund tinder | Tinder plus cant view like anymore‚Ä¶.

Lmk thanks | This app used to be amazing in my eyes. Never had any issues with it until recently, like within the past month or so. I have to keep deleting the app and reinstalling it for me to send any kind of messages or to read new incoming messages. Never had his issue before but it just get super time consuming having to delete and reinstall. When I get incoming messages I press on the push notification to read it and it never shows up and when I try to reply the text doesn‚Äôt go Thru so then I have to do the entire process over and over. Usually works for like 3-5 text and then after I have to delete and reinstall for it  to work . Just more annoying than anything since I‚Äôve never had this issue before. Was thinking of paying the monthly or yearly fees to keep the number and receive codes and what not ,but since this issue has developed I am holding off for the time being to see if it‚Äôs an app issue or not. | My text now keeps loading and keeps moving the screen if it‚Äôs a bug fix it please but love the app | messages won't even load what a joke | App is cool but it froze,it crash, it takes long to load an image or photos I get | This app is amazingly constructed for convenient text messages and partial dial talk. | Thanks for making this a possibility texting and calling without a carrier is beneficial to the world! I Love this app. | That's a lot of inappropriate ads we deserve quality service no more adsPlease fix the bug and freezingAre using my phone with the app it's not letting me to text my friends Please fix this issue | best app ever , this is the reason i‚Äôm happy in life. | I have loved this app since i got it. It literally helped me get a job since I had no other working phone service at the time. I have since paid to lock my number and use this when im out of service and have wifi access. I even have a 2nd phone, no simcard, that i use for wifi only and this app. 
Yet the past couple months I can barely make a call or send a text. Same for receiving calls/texts. Just says Preparing and the texts i spend time typing disappear as soon as i hit send and never actually send. 
The only fix is to delete the app and reinstall on iphones. As for my android it doesnt work at all. 
I see in other comments this is a known issue. I have had this since before the recent update, which is why i updated it. What did you or apple change that causes this app to be useless ?
Also i cant even add or look at contacts. Just a blank screen. | I haven‚Äôt been able to use this app in over 3 months or see and or my phone calls or text messages please fix | I have had this app for a year or so now and when I first got it I loved it. But this year something seems to have happened with the network provider (at least that‚Äôs my guess I‚Äôve found nothing about this on through app support.)  Now the app is slow to load and that‚Äôs IF it loads. I have been unable to use my number through the app for months now. It does work through the website but I‚Äôd love for the app to function smoothly like it use to. The app now will load forever and it‚Äôs not from being in a place that isn‚Äôt covered because my entire city has full coverage on the map they offer to check yet I‚Äôm still having this issue. I‚Äôd be right back to recommending this service to people if they could fix the bugs with the app because it was my saving Grace when I was homeless and trying to get a job with out the money to buy a phone plan. This app has so so much potential I hope it gets fixed. | They will ban you on sight for using a vpn. The phone number doesn‚Äôt work for basic use cases across multiple apps. Scam. Used to be good. | I WAS considering purchasing a SIM card or upgrading my number for this app but it‚Äôs a terrible app. SO NO WAY! I‚Äôm not spending money on a crappy app. 
Calls and text do not go through they just stick on preparing. And the app won‚Äôt let you update your profile. It‚Äôs a horrible app now. USELESS! | The app has turned to complete trash over the last year, I must delete and reinstall the app everytime I want to use the app after 2 minutes. It‚Äôs as bad as, you won‚Äôt receive messages, calls, or even be able to send a message or call, until reinstalling and logging back in each time. I‚Äôd say buy the service they have, but that just means your app won‚Äôt work on the go. Go with any other texting app, or pay for service. | I bet I can leave my device on this app for a month and it‚Äôll never stop lagging , terrible app DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!! | wont let me call out nor make text let alone deleted all my contacts love this app | The app is very buggy and freezes all the time and my messages don‚Äôt send | Incoming calls don‚Äôt ring but you receive a missed call notification. Even though I secure my number for a week but I think you should keep the money. I just uninstalled this app. I will never recommend it. | Is too good to connect people‚Äôs is perfect for me and my family | Every time I try to send a message it doesn‚Äôt go thru cn it plz be fixed? | I‚Äôve sent multiple messages but only one has went through ‚Ä¶ idk if it‚Äôs a glitch or what but I‚Äôve looked on the Twitter support to see if there was an outage and there wasn‚Äôt . Idk if this is just for me or a wide occurrence but it‚Äôs actually frustrating . | I have two phones 5 lines would be lost without this app it‚Äôs the best hands down | Completely free unless you choose to pay but it‚Äôs a good app if you wanna text someone and you don‚Äôt really know them like if your gaming or something else | It‚Äôs not working at all. I click on contacts or try to call and text and it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs frozen. | The reason why I‚Äôm frustrated with this app is because every time I download it on my iPad it will say every five hours or so it‚Äôs days prevent text or calls turn on notifications and they always are then I have to delete it and download over and over again | amazing app | Works great on my iPhone 14 , but glitches a lot on my iPhone 7. Won‚Äôt send messages or call out unless I log out and log back in. ! Shows up on notifications settings‚Ä¶. Almost unusable | Whenever I open the main screen for the app, the screen freezes, and no new messages generate even if I receive notifications that new messages have came my way. If I try to text the person who sent the message, the message won‚Äôt go through at all, and the app crashes. I haven‚Äôt been able to use Textnow for at least 2 months now, and would like a solution or bug patch for this issue. I‚Äôve deleted the app multiple times to no avail. | That‚Äôs my review. | When I finally bought there subscription they blocked my account for no reason and I wasn‚Äôt able to TEXT ANYONE | At face value, they offer a useful service for legitimate uses.

My legitimate use was a second number for my girlfriend to create a Whatsapp and Telegram account, because she can't receive them in her out of network area.

I paid for a locked in number, and not 24 hours after subscribing, they disabled my account without reason. 

I didn't use VPN, used a real email, and didn't break the law. They took my money and disabled my account the next day. The developers are clearly crooks, will probably blame it on a system error, and I'll never see the money again.

If it had been a greater amount of money, I would take you to court, but you're counting on nobody litigating because of such a small subscription price.

Crooked app, crooked company. 0/5. | Crashed only works on speaker fix that issue asap | The app is not functioning normally and it has been frustrating. | I used the app for two seconds and it said I violated terms of service, only thing that got violated was my time installing it, trying another app that‚Äôs actually usable. | I've been using the app for years and for some unknown reason it's not letting me make calls or send text or recieve texts or calls and I would like to know why if someone could give me an explanation that would be great then | The app is not working right and won‚Äôt give proper texts and calls it also doesn‚Äôt let me view texts that a get  
and is ver glitchy | I would normally give this app a 5 star rating. I have had it for about 5 years+ and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it until this last few months. No matter what phone I use (I‚Äôve tried 4 different phones) or what account of the 3 I use, it has been freezing up completely and I end up having to delete and re-download the app every couple days. It‚Äôs super frustrating and has caused me missing MULTIPLE important phone calls along with the fact that I not only miss phone calls, but a lot of them don‚Äôt show up at all. I have also had a lot of missing text messages over the last few months (people tell me they have text me and it never shows up.) it has to be part of the same issue. Whatever it is, please get it fixed asap. Otherwise I will just end up erasing and deleting all my accounts and I really don‚Äôt want to have to do that. | The thing is
