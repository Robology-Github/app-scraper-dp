SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.",Travel,4+,106180608,2019-08-22 07:00:00+00:00,2024-04-11 22:31:17+00:00,"Wanderlog's available in more languages!

An essential tool for global expats, digital nomads, permanent residents, dual residents, overseas homeowners, and frequent travellers.

AUTO TRIP RECORDING
With geolocation tracking, Flamingo automatically determines if you have left your residence country or state and accurately records your trip details so that you don’t have to. Keep tabs on the countries and states you’ve visited and how many days you spent there.

SCHENGEN AREA CALCULATOR
If you frequently travel to the EU Schengen Travel Area as a non-resident, it can be a hassle to keep up with the 90 in 180 days rule. Flamingo counts how many combined days you’ve already spent in Schengen countries and how many more you have left in the 180-day period. If you’re already located in the EU as a non-resident, Flamingo tells you the date when you have to leave to avoid overstaying.
The built-in calculator helps you determine not only the earliest date you can travel to the EU for your desired number of days, but also for how many days you can stay if you arrive on your desired date.

VISA-FREE STAY
Based on your citizenship, Flamingo automatically identifies to which countries you need a visa, e-visa, or visa on arrival and where you can travel absolutely visa-free.
Coming soon: Flamingo will also tell you how long you can stay in each country visa-free, monitor your duration of stay and alert you when you’ll be close to overstaying.

RESIDENCE STATUS FOR COUNTRIES & US STATES
Flamingo helps you determine your physical presence for domicile and residency by automatically recording and counting how many days you spend there.
*Especially useful for Statutory Residence Test for UK expats and Substantial and Physical Presence Tests for US expats and permanent residents.

EXPORT REPORTS
You can download a customizable CSV report with your travel details with the tap of a button. Share it with authorities and lawyers in seconds or keep it for your own travel records. 

COMPLETE PRIVACY
Your travel, residency, and visa data is stored locally only on your device. We do not collect, nor store, your information on our servers.

We exist to help you escape this bad stuff. So you're free to have a more mindful, authentic and memorable trip.

com.lyfshort.lyfshortapp,Lyfshort Trip & Event Planner,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lyfshort-trip-event-planner/id1399359482?uo=4,"Lyfshort® is a free Trip & Event organising app for individual or private group use.  A web version is also available at https://app.lyfshort.com.

Typically managing and sharing information and communication when planning group Trips or Events is a headache.  Many people resort to using a range of disconnected apps, social media platforms, software, spreadsheets etc. accompanied by a spaghetti of email, SMS and messaging threads, none of which are really designed for this purpose.

Lyfshort helps plan, store, and manage Trip & Event information in an itinerary format.  It also centralises sharing and communication with friends along with participant invitations, access and expense management, booking imports and group messaging. 

Efficiently manage your planning, research, times, dates & time zones, location mapping, budgeting and expense tracking, supplier bookings, group participants, photo and PDF sharing, messaging and communication, all in one place.

Whether it's a weekend away, sport trip, adventure travel, reunion, bucks or hens night, or a dream holiday around the world, Lyfshort has you covered.


HOW IT WORKS

Start an Itinerary :

Begin with a Trip or Event idea.

Eg. Our Family Holiday, Road Trip with the fellas, Hawaiian Getaway, Jessica’s Bachelorette Party, Dream Overseas Vacation, Rob and Debs Wedding etc.


Add Items or Import Bookings :

Start planning by adding a list of things you want to do as itinerary items or Import existing bookings from different suppliers as items by sending supplier email confirmations to go@lyfshort.com ... Catch a flight? stay in accommodation? meet friends? Sight See? Go for drinks? Hire a Car? etc.

Research & Record :

Research online, save screenshots, bookmarks and text straight back to each activity for future reference and group sharing.


Expense Planning and Management :

Plan a budget then record pre/during/post trip expenses, individually and across a group. (Includes automated currency conversion & expense split calculator).


Invite & Share :

Get the group together, invite participants and co-organisers with simple SMS, email and social media links. Then share itinerary details, research, expenses, images and bookmarks with the group.


Message & Collaborate :

Communicate in real-time using group messaging linked back to each specific activity for quick, easy reference.


Location & Transit Mapping :

Use integrated Google Maps within Lyfshort to quickly find locations when planning then save point to point transit routes for guidance when the trip comes along.


Share Photos :

Participants now have a central place to upload and download photos taken before, during and after the Trip or Event, all saved together with the details. This is also great for finding the photos months or years later rather than searching thousands mixed together on a device.


Device Calendar Sync :

Manage activity times and dates in one place by syncing Lyfshort itinerary details and your mobile device calendar.


Export Itineraries :

Save as a PDF.  Share with people that may not be participating in the activity, save offline or print as a hard copy.

Vacation planning, redefined

Once you’re booked on a cruise, plan your entire vacation from the app. Reserve shore excursions for every port, purchase or upgrade beverage packages for endless toasts, and internet packages to stay connected while at sea, though the app is free to use on ship Wi-Fi. 

Put together a relaxing spa day... or days... and make dining reservations at distinctive specialty restaurants. Explore other pre-cruise deals in the casino, check out VIP Passes and make your cruise truly special with gifts and gear. And don’t forget to link reservations with your travel party so you can make plans together. 

Set sail like a pro

As your cruise approaches, use the app to check-in and qualify for the fastest boarding experience. Before you head to the terminal on boarding day, begin your mandatory safety briefing and access your set sail pass. 

To plan all the fun, find all the shows and activities in the Daily Planner and build your personalized calendar. We’ll even remind you with a notification when you have plans. 

Be sure to smile for the camera because you’ll be able to view, purchase and download your photos right from the app (on select ships). Use the app to find your way around with detailed deck maps and chat with your travel party through group or 1-on-1 chats. You can track your onboard expenses in the app (or not... you’ll be on vacation, after all) and learn how to book your next cruise while onboard for the best deals. 

After your cruise, you can continue to track your loyalty status and perks, keep up with the latest and greatest from our family of brands in the video library, and start planning and booking your next cruise. Because we know this won’t be your last!

• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.
• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.
• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).
• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.

com.montgomery.rideon,Ride On Trip Planner,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ride-on-trip-planner/id1670305867?uo=4,"Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT) partnered with Moovit, a global bus trip planning mobile app software company, to launch a new Ride On Trip Planner – a Ride On bus passenger load and local trip planning app. This new, innovative app will allow riders to plan their next trip and to tell how crowded a Ride On bus is – before it arrives – with the crowdedness indicator on the app riders can  choose if they want to get on the bus arriving, wait for the next bus depending on how many people are on the bus, or choose another travel option, such as other local transit services, bikeshare, and scooter. It gives riders more control over their transportation experience. The app also includes dashboards for the Ride On Central Communications team to monitor bus loads and more quickly dispatch additional buses when buses are full.

The Ride On Trip Planner app is easy to use and can be downloaded from the Apple app store. Riders choose their current location and their destination and then pick the most desirable route that fits their travel plans. Once the route is chosen, the app will give the exact time the next bus will arrive, while providing step-by-step directions on how to get to the bus stop and how to get to the rider’s destination after getting off the bus. The app will also notify riders when it's time to get off so they can browse other apps and surf the web, without having to worry about missing their stop. The app was created to alleviate stress and worry about bus times and continue to reduce the spread of infectious diseases with the crowdedness indicator.

This Ride On Trip Planner app is being funded by a federal grant to help the community continue to travel locally in a safe and more efficient way. This partnership is a two-year pilot to test the combined Ride On passenger load and trip planning functionalities in the County and beyond. After the pilot is completed, decisions will be made on whether to keep this application, expand its capabilities, or use it to replace the current Ride On Real Time application, based on feedback from County residents and other users.    


The Ride On Trip Planner solution is based on Moovit’s long-running robust native and web transit apps designed for endless scale and serving 100s of millions of users worldwide, with zero downtime. 
The application features:  

•	Multimodal trip planning – in addition to Ride On route options, it will include other options like local transit services, bikeshare and scooter options
•	Real-time arrivals
•	Customized micro-mobility integrations

The Ride On Trip Planner app solution includes the iPhone app, which benefits from Moovit’s rich user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), as well as comprehensive transit data, developed in partnerships with some of the most well-known transit, mobility and accessibility organizations worldwide.

The Ride On Trip Planner app will feature a range of accessibility capabilities to benefit users with disabilities, including blindness or low vision, ambulatory impairments, and hand-motor disabilities, enabling them to use public transit confidently and maximize their opportunities in the workplace, education, and social life. 

The Moovit technology has more than 1.7 billion users in 112 countries, 3,500 cities, 7,500 transit agencies, and in 45 languages, and is a leading Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) solutions company and the world’s most popular urban mobility app, making getting around cities easier and more convenient.

GET THERE YOUR WAY - We’ve built a world for motorcyclists, helping you find the best routes with the twistiest turns, for paved touring and unpaved adventures. It’s not the destination that counts. It’s the journey.

FIND THE ROAD - Straight, curvy, paved, dirty - Scenic lets you control your route like no other app. And with thousands of public routes to choose from, there's always road to ride.

TAKE CONTROL - Plan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy.

UNLOCK EPIC RIDES - Scenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search', and see what comes up. 

GO EXPLORING - Yet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing.

GET ORGANISED - Found a great route online? Have some lying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB, or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure.

FIND FOCUS - On-screen instructions, turn-by-turn navigation, and customizable detour behavior mean you can focus on the road, not your phone. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves, or one of the supported handlebar controllers.

CHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Customize your map, toggling between built-in layers like traffic flow, safety camera alerts, and 3D buildings, as well as a huge list of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle services, restaurants, hotels, and more!

ONE STEP AHEAD - Dirt road visualization, elevation profiles, speed camera warnings, and traffic visualized on the map keep you prepared for what’s around the corner.

GO OFF GRID - No data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back.

 KNOW YOUR RIDE - Scenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed, and elevation - helping you relive every moment, track your progress, and challenge your friends.

SHARE THE ADVENTURE - Leave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalized web page of your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media.

Lumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! 

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. 

Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

“Purchasing the tickets to Dream World, on Headout was a fantastic decision. The booking process was smooth and straightforward, and I was able to easily select the date and time that suited me and my family best. At Dream World, not only did we breeze through the crowds, but it meant we we sure of getting entry into the theme park, especially with two children - both under the age of 8 years - eager to start exploring the park without any delay or drama! Buying the Dream World Visa gave us access to (almost) all the rides so with the wrist band on us, we went straight through without having the hassle of looking for change/currency at each ride. All in all, it was a stress-free and wonderful experience!”

“Book and pay a ticket and pay in the app with just a few clicks. Tickets do not have to be printed out and can simply be shown digitally in the app. It couldn’t be easier.
Everything went well on site. Versailles was breathtaking!”

“Through a different provider, I had a trip cancelled last minute the day before and was able to book on to this tour late in the evening the day before. Tickets and confirmation of collection point were clear and the tickets are very easily available on the app. We were picked up at the pick up location on time, and our guide met us and explained what the experience would entail and the time scales. I think our guides make was Raphael, he was very knowledgeable and gave us a very detailed explanation of Krakows history as we were driving through Krakow towards Auschwitz. Showing us all the landmark buildings and their history along the way. Very easy to understand and communicated very well, and very passionate about education us all on Polish history. Very happy with this service and would recommend using them to book tours through.”

com.passporterapp.passporter,Passporter | Plan and Travel,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/passporter-plan-and-travel/id1234282611?uo=4,"Passporter, the app that will help you organize and plan your trip easily and quickly.

Our goal is to become your personal travel guide, a planner that will accompany you in all phases of your adventure. The Passporter app has been designed to inspire you with travel inspiration and recommendations from travelers like you. To organize your trip either alone or with your group of friends by inviting them to edit your itinerary. Book your flights, accommodations or activities directly from the app or upload them in PDF format. Highlight points of interest on the map of your route and organize it by days, stages or types of travel. And most importantly, you will be able to share all your travel recommendations with your friends and family :)  We travel with you wherever you go. 

*Before traveling:

Traveling is, without a doubt, one of the best possible experiences. However, getting informed and planning what you are going to do on your next trip can be a slow and boring process. That's why at Passporter we make it easy for you: we have selected the best content from our travelers so that with just one click you can access the top content. Maps, travel routes, unique places, selfie spots, typical monuments, the best restaurants... so that, no matter what you are looking for, you will find the perfect itinerary for you. And if you don't see anything that inspires you, you can always create new places with the recommendations of your friends who already know the destination. With this planner, trips seem to organize themselves!

*Put everything you need for your trip in order:

With Passporter you can save your reservations and important documents so you always have everything you need at hand - say goodbye to the stress of not finding your boarding pass in the inbox when it's your turn at the airport! In addition, you can create notes with recommendations from friends, blogs or social networks and have them always organized and accessible. Because nothing is more annoying than not remembering the name of that coffee shop that was recommended to you.

*Personalize your itinerary:

One of the strong points of this planner is that you can create categories to sort the places you want to visit as best suits you: by days, type of place, location on the maps... or however you want. In this way, you will create personalized and much more complete routes.

*Add reference points:

And so that you never miss any interesting place on your trips again, mark as a reference point the places you want to visit and you will always have them at hand highlighted among the others on the maps. 

*Organize your trip in a group:

Because we usually travel with more people, with this planner you can make travel easier for all your companions and yourself, inviting them to the itinerary so you can organize and plan together all the documents, places, routes, maps....

*Enjoy your planning while you are on the road:

Access your ongoing itinerary, review the day's plans and dedicate yourself to exploring and enjoying the vacation with your group of friends by carrying important documents and places to visit always at hand. With Passporter, forget about everything but enjoying the trips and the fantastic routes you've created or found, knowing that you have everything organized in the planner in your pocket.

*Share your anecdotes after the trip:

You will be able to recount your experience and share it with your friends or other travelers. To do this, create memories of the places you liked the most and come back to Passporter again and again to relive your adventures and retrace your routes through travel photos. Turn your notes into tips or travel diaries and become the envy of your friends and acquaintances!",Travel,12+,111151104,2018-06-08 22:52:52+00:00,2024-04-24 20:01:50+00:00,"New version with new features and improvements to plan your trips!

Lumen Trails Daily Tracker lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car! Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Daily Tracker for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Daily Tracker is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits, or even net worth? Daily Tracker is the app for that!

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. You'll have all your important data stored in one convenient place, for many years to come.

Designed exclusively for the iPhone and iPad, Daily Tracker is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 12 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Drive.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

com.Badger.badger,Badger Maps: #1 Route Planner,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/badger-maps-1-route-planner/id789934914?uo=4,"Badger Maps is an all-in-one field sales app that helps outside sales professionals increase revenue and save time by automating busywork. 

Founded in 2012, Badger solves a longstanding field sales problem: juggling a map, a calendar, a schedule, and client data — all while dealing with traffic and spending hours behind the wheel, struggling to arrive to appointments on time. 

Badger is designed with all the needs of field salespeople in mind. It takes care of all of their challenges with multiple features: route optimization (with 100+ stops), lead generation, interactive client data visualization (import your spreadsheet or sync Badger with your CRM), meeting notes logging, field activity reports, and more! 

With Badger, a field sales rep has 10 more meetings a week, saves 3 hours behind the wheel, and cuts time spent on frustrating admin work by half. 

Additionally, field sales managers can get insights on their reps’ performance in the field, manage territories more easily, boost CRM adoption, plan their reps’ accounts and routes, and tackle any problems in the team before they even arise.  

Here’s the monthly ROI you can get with Badger:

• 22% more sales
• 20% fewer miles 
• 32 hours less planning and scheduling
• And 40 extra meetings 

One of our customers, NCR Aloha, a POS software provider, grew sales by 20% monthly and reduced drive and planning time by 25% daily and 50% weekly, respectively. 

Cutter & Buck, a sportswear company, obtained 8 extra meetings weekly per rep and grew annual revenue by 22%. 

Here’s what our customers are saying: 

“Our efficiency has easily increased over 100% since we’ve implemented Badger Maps. Each rep is seeing at least 2 more accounts and finding 2 more prospecting opportunities per day.”

— Ken Buck, Regional Sales Manager, Danaher

“With Badger, I averaged 25% more in sales in the last year. I also cut my driving by a huge amount, no more zig-zagging all over town.”

— Lara Thomas, Sales Rep, DermaTran

“Badger contributed heavily to our bottom line. Reps consistently met our goal of 10 meetings a day, 50 per week. That wouldn’t have been possible without Badger.”

— Rich Becker, Grad Solutions, Arizona Director of Business Development

Below is an overview of the features we offer (feel free to visit our website for more details). 

Our features will contribute to your bottom line by cutting drive and planning time — giving you more time to sell. 

But Badger goes beyond just saving you time in driving and planning. 

It also equips you with on-the-go lead generation, mobile territory management, customer visualization on a map, and more!

• Route Planning & Optimization

Quickly select the accounts you’d like to meet and create the fastest route with one swipe. Add up to 120 stops to your route and optimize it in seconds. Save your routes for future use and plan a week’s worth of routes in seconds. 

• Find New Leads on the Go

Fill schedule gaps after a canceled appointment with new leads that you can find based on keywords like industry, product type, and business name. Add them to your optimized route and get there in minutes.

• Visualize and Segment Customer Data on a Map

Visualize and segment your prospects and customers using attributes such as priority, sales YTD, and days since the last meeting. Your territory colorized and filtered by customizable characteristics will enable you to see your best opportunities at your fingertips. 

• Customer Relationship Management 

Manage customer relationships easily by setting up follow-up reminders and logging meeting notes — including photos — to get an A+ on customer satisfaction. You can also send data to your CRM directly from Badger and receive weekly sales reports to quickly understand what’s working and what’s not.

It provides travel information for the entire public transport network in the city of Munich and the surrounding regions (districts of Bad-Tölz Wolfratshausen, Dachau, Ebersberg, Erding, Freising, Fürstenfeldbruck, Miesbach, München, Rosenheim, Starnberg and the city of Rosenheim) – no matter whether you go by train, (sub)urban railways, underground, tram or bus. In many cases with real-time information. With the MVV-App you can also purchase selected MVV tickets with your smartphone or tablet on the go. Register once and you have the option to either buy the single trip tickets or you can choose to buy one of our day tickets for your stay in Munich. Besides, the MVV-App provides additional information on public transport in the entire Greater Munich Area, such as public transport and tariff maps as well as any changes in the timetables.

Features:
========

• Departures: The departure monitor indicates the next departures and/or arrivals from a stop or the stops in the neighborhood of your current location in real-time (where available). 

• Trips: The journey planner will help you to find the quickest route from A to B – in many cases with real-time information. Just enter the name of a stop, a point of interest or any desired address in Munich or the surrounding districts as your starting point or destination. With GPS you can also use your current location. The results include all footpath directions. The MVV-App also helps you buy the correct ticket for the selected journey. With just a few clicks you can purchase mobile tickets directly from the journey planner.

• Disruptions: At a glance, you can see disruptions that might affect your daily commute ordered by lines and their operation names. As yet, the descriptions of timetable changes are only available in German.   

• Tickets: With menu item “Tickets” you can purchase selected MVV tickets as mobile ticket. Register once within one of the listed shops (identical range of tickets) and choose your ticket before starting your journey. You can pay for your tickets by using Google Pay, a credit card or direct debit. As electronic tickets are personalized, you have to bring your official photo ID.

• Network plans: In addition, the MVV-App provides you with various public transport network plans and tariff maps. Although most of the plans are in German language, you can find several plans in English, too. For example: the general plan of the regional train, suburban train and underground in the entire MVV area.

• Interactive map: The interactive map does not just help you to come along in the MVV area.  You get access to further information such as nearby departures by using your GPS signal for example.

• Settings: If you choose the appropriate settings, you can for example avoid stairs during your trip or prefer less walking time over the quickest connection. In case you take a bike with you, the journey planner is able to take this into account too. You can also exclude connections not being integrated within the MVV tariff.",Travel,4+,139682816,2011-04-05 11:52:26+00:00,2023-12-20 08:13:51+00:00,"Thanks a lot for your feedback.

TESTIMONIALS
My friends and I do a lot of traveling for powwow season and, being like a giant family reunion already, it can be CRAZY trying to coordinate everyone with places, times, and pooled funds. We used to “volunteer” someone to play point person for the group and be in charge of making sure everyone was on the same page and all registration fees have been covered…but this app has made EVERYTHING so much easier, even when we’re all in different parts of the country trying to meet up at an event. Easy to use and fun, it’s like it’s own festival on my phone. And we’ve found the coolest places we would’ve never checked out if Foresyte hadn’t recommended - highly recommend.
- Michelle Collins

I downloaded Foresyte a couple months ago and this app is solid. Me and my friends just used it to plan our trip through Europe earlier this month and it worked great. Group chat inside of the trip itinerary is such a great concept
- steve s

Foresyte seems like the type of app that could become an everyday essential. Very clean interface and rich set of features.
- KevinKeef

My bro asked me to plan his bachelor party and his friends are kinda flaky. This definitely helped me pull everyone together for the travel weekend.
- Ruby4401

I travel frequently between work and personal trips. Foresyte is a great way to manage my travel calendar apart from the 1000 other meetings listed on my work calendar
- ChrisW

As someone who travels a lot I've always wanted a better way to visualize my schedule. This app solves the problem of needing to check various sources to pull together upcoming group trip plans on our bucket list.
- MiniMom

I have been needing some way to plan for all my trips coming up and I’m so excited to have found this app. I can fully enjoy the moment because I'm financially ready for it. Love the new updates too! Makes it so easy to use now. The perfect trip planner

com.roycroft-labs.SchengenSimple,Schengen Simple,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/schengen-simple/id1637045933?uo=4,">Why choose Schengen Simple?

Schengen Simple answers the key question that other apps don’t:
What is the maximum I can travel for, on any date, whilst ensuring I can still go on ALL my planned trips, never breaking the 90/180 rule?

To illustrate what makes Schengen Simple unique: say you have a trip next week and another in 2 months, and you want to add another trip in between. With Schengen Simple, you’ll know exactly how long that trip in the middle could be without causing an overstay. No other calculator can do this.

Other calculators can only tell you if a trip fits in with the trips that came BEFORE it. They are just counting the trips in the past 180 days. Schengen Simple’s algorithm is smarter, always looking forwards and backwards, ensuring ALL your plans are compatible.

Most other apps' calculations are misleading. Even apps which claim to account for future trips don’t really, which is why they overestimate your allowance.

>Trust your calculator

Here’s a simple test you can do to choose the right app for you.

Enter a 90-day trip in the calculator you’re testing. Now check the allowance for the days leading up to this trip; most will say you have an allowance of 90 because they’re only looking backwards. This is wrong, as we know you are already committed to the 90-day trip you just entered. The correct allowance should be zero for the 90 days preceding this trip. Other apps will incorrectly display that you have a 90-day allowance, and then when you try to enter a trip, will complain you’re causing an overstay - which we find frustrating.

The above example is simple as there is only one trip. As you enter more trips of varying lengths, we need to account for many interacting 180-day windows.

This is what makes Schengen Simple unique - it handles this instantly and accurately.

You’ll always know how long you can travel whilst ensuring you can still take every trip in your calendar.

>Features

• No need to nominate a date of entry, Schengen Simple analyses all your past and future trips, instantly updating your allowance for your entire calendar. Making it fast, easy and accurate to plan your travels.

• Never worry about having enough allowance to take your future trips. Always know how long you can travel, on any date, whilst ensuring you can still take your planned trips.

• Passport Control mode displays exactly how long you’ve been in the Schengen Area in a given 180-day period.

• Seeing your allowance under each date in your calendar gives full visibility of when your allowance changes so you can make smarter decisions about when to travel. Often if you wait a few days, you’ll get an increase in your allowance. Only Schengen Simple lets you see this at a glance.

• Allowance Analysis - easily probe why your allowance is what is for a given date, so you know which trips you could edit to stay longer.

• The Schengen Simple algorithm has been tested rigorously, so you can fully trust its calculations. This includes rigorous testing against the official EU calculator.

• Clear, simple and easy to use - even calculators deserve beautiful design.

>Pricing

Get started with a 1week free trial, after which an annual subscription gives you full access to all features - prices vary by country.

>Why should I subscribe when some apps offer a one-off price?

• Schengen Simple is a service we are committed to growing and supporting. We are dedicated to keeping our customers happy over the long term and building a service they’ll love, with many great features in the pipeline.
• We will never sell your data and don’t advertise.
• We stay up-to-date with the Schengen Area and its rules to keep you informed and give you peace of mind.
