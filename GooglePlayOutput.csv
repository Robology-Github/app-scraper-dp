You can't beat the price. | amazing items and good qualities | very likely supports child labor | I love this site it is a lot better than wish . It doesn't take that long to get too at all. | It says buy us alert on the prices | great | Patient during the fish game due to friends letting me know it pays off,legit! | Just like dhgate. | beautiful perfect for my arrangement | Listen I just dont like this app a lot of ads and at the time they gave u free stuff they really did but kinda scam for a lot of ppl like wow u created acc omg 2 free gifts omg maximum discount possible alr noe I need to share to friends so I can get the rest . At that time everyone heard the word free so they downloaded it and gave each other code but it wont work cause temu has been installed and all so they getting momey through ads and all market scam knew it from beginning | excellent prices, keeps you updated with delivery | I am completely satisfied with everything I have ordered from temu. so far I have ordered 8 times | This apps poes man | love the prices! 98% of what I bought so far has been hassle free! loved everything I got. only 2 items I've had issues with. Sizes always run on a small side .otherwise if I shop it's always temu. | THEY SAID THAT IT WAS FREE SHIPPING BUT THEY CHARGED ME 200 DOLLARS FOR SHIPPING GAS AL THAT STUFF AND I STARTED BUYING FROM SHEIN 1 OUT OF 5 DO NOT RECOMMEND | super App appreciate | Excellent deals and fun to search for. | Love browsing and shopping here. great prices great products | I love Temu. I love the free gifts. I will continue to be a loyal customer. | Love it | prices are awesome but quality is hit and miss | To much stuff broke | Don't get sucked in on their game waste of time and don't win nothing | Bought all sorts. Good ptices. | Bad quality | la app te dice que tienes q comprar u. producto caro para poder comprar el que tiene el 96% de descuento osea que nivek de marketing tan berraco | Perfect 👌 | thanks for your product recomend super fast shipping works great | It's been good so far | good quality 👏👏👏 | prices are great just make sure you read the descriptions | Temu good, Biden sucks | this the one right here no cap 🧢 get it you'll thank me later. so many good things from sneaks to wireless tattoo kits . yo you need to get up on this. | Downloaded app caused to many issues, had to delete it, and still have issues with pop-ups! Also, lost interest with the spinning of a wheel interruptions while trying to shop. | Some really cute baby clothes. Adult things not so good. Price right, but quality can be disappointing. | Great prices . great products. | This Is a total scam. I don't know how is it possible that they are allowing this here. 1. It ads for an item with x price and when you go to buy it, it jumps like 2x the original. 2. The reviews on the app are controlled by the app. They allow only best reviews on. 3. There are some games on the app which is impossible to complete. 4. It says for an item that it has 90% off, but when you go there and see from the original price, not even it doesn't have any change but it's increased. | TEMU una de mis apps favoritas. | good service with good products | all arrived on time and happy with goods and service | product's are way cheaper and as good as you would buy in a more costly store thank you Temu | Its a great shopping experience | Iam very disappointed in the orders not being here for Christmas,my family was very upset and I am not going to do any orders now. | love it and the prices | All of their products work!!! I ordered more items and I can't wait for them to arrive in the mail!! I love Temu!! 😁😁😁😁 | 🥰🥰🥰🥰 | Best products at the best prices | If you want an annoyance of notifications, really cheap-low quality stuff, and Chinese spying on your phone.... this is the app for you. | You are sacrifing people for the sake of cheap products that don't work if you wanna know about it search on YouTube and Google fir more | Aweful constantly bombarding my phone | To much pushy | Easy to use, get free items from time to time and cheap, a win win deal | Terrible! Full of fake promotions!!! The fishland game supposed to earn you free stuff is a scam designed to never end. The discounts are not real they just jack up a fake price to try and sell you stuff for the same price they're originally posted for. And when you try to apply a discount code to something you already put in your cart it suddenly becomes unavailable! Lol total scam!!! | cheap and great products | Very satisfied. Prompt service | Satisfied with my items ordered. | everything I have ordered is good and always on time | easy way if u don't have enough money buy now pay in 4 time | they're awesome they got nice gifts | Not that good | very good app. products are genuine and quick delivery | Invasive app. I have all notifications blocked from this app on my phone and they still bypass it some way, as I get notifications on the daily. This isn't even mentioning the false advertising of these cheap products from China... | Love everything thank you | this app is legit. everything I've ordered came on time | should be useful(the annual fair in my town shut years back NO CARNIES !?where hast gone vulcanized trump branded stem cell adjacent lab grown marital aid/subcutaneous hydroxycloroqine injector/lil'prankster electromagnetic high freq. voting machine corrections assembly with a 24/7/365 fed judge appointing AI as the core software and last but not least kungfu grip Putin and the Despot Pals HJ action!? TEMu of course,yet somehow these refuse bins in people suits are somehow worse then it's trash | very nice shopping app true to size and the products are very good... | love my Temu | Picked out two peace men's suit , must say very impressed. | It's bater then order I am interested | Great | Too many ""offers"" | I think it's fake because I tried to hard to get the free gifts but I can't even though I send it to all of my friends and they opened but it still did not work like I'm shame of sending it to my friends bro like ugh.😫 | Don't order anything it's like fir small kids what's they showing is not that so plz don't order any thing. Such a bad app | I love this game | I saw a Labradorite I like, and I clicked on it interested. The wheel for discounts spins, and I hit 100%, yeah, whatever, and then another wheel spins x4 - so basically, now I have a ""free"" item with ""free"" shipping from the app. So, I downloaded the app and went back to the item I wanted. Yep, everything changed. Now free is $15.99! Took me back to 9th grade business law class in high school 1976, and was educated about this scam referred to as bait and switch. Temu is BAIT AND SEITCH. Bye! | Free item that was offered to me suddenly appeared in my basket days after, after I had paid for my other items that it was gonna be shipped with. Won't be using again. | nice | easy to use took over from wish with ease | I love Temu, the quality of their products is impeccable. The waiting time to receive it was short and everything was well packaged. Can't wait to receive my next order. | fantastic store | great app | Very inexpensive. Great value and true to size. | mostly nice products and they stand behind them for you and me | Quality is something else | great service quick delivery and good quality | Got it cause I seen a tiktok with a code for robux. Didn't work and was very leggy. Got kicked out of the app twice | he pedido 3 paquetes, y solo 2 llegaron completos. La granja y el acuario son solo estafas y no valen la pena. Y el tiempo de llegada de los productos es de alrededor de un mes. | Items are smaller than appear in ""Photoshop"" pics online. ALSO....BEWARE of PROMOTION SCAM asking for referrals to win free gifts you choose....long drawn out game reducing cost from 100s $ down to $5 but they NEVER RELEASE that last 5$ and it seems glitched.....then you read rules and see that if you can't get it ALL claimed to $0. then you GET NOTHING...... IT'S A PROMOTIONAL SCAM COMPANY. TEMU NEEDS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THEM IF THEY WANT TO BE CREDIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES. Or we BAN them. | Have been using this for a long time but never faced any issues! The products are always exactly like the description and as good as shown. Never had any issue with shipping/delivering either. Everything is affordable and great quality. It has everything and slowly becoming better and better. It is also currently developing cultural stuff including anime! There are anime figures as well as clothing and accessories! Definitely recommend this app! Best shopping app I've ever used! | useful | everything I have bought from temu has been worth the money | Good prices very satisfied and luv shopping on phone!! | Good | look at what your buying close some stuff is awesome & some is not so good, Thank You. | This app is a complete scam. It sends misleading information and tricks people with fake notifications, urging them to invite others and promising rewards. However, in the end, you realize it's all a waste of time and effort. Even the customer service is fake. | Everything ordered was good | I think I'm addicted, has everything and orders usually received within a week | The only thing I hate about the app is that it takes a while to come | They are reliable and competent. | All good up to now thank u | Excellent service every time | affordable prices and good quality. | Happy with all my purchases | Love some item, some stuff is good for the money. They need to work on the wrapping for shipping so items don't break or get missing from the cheat wrapping bag | Love Temu! Great products, prices and customer service! Easy returns and great delivery. | Great value and quality | I love this page goods are brilliant never had any problems totally safe too | Good | The game is a cheating game but to buy stuff from there is okay I should be getting free stuff from this game and I have not received not one free thing for as much money as I spent | goes on beautiful | Pictures of women and men in very inopoprite pics never use this app Fear Allah (SWT) who owns our eyes and every thing every cell every thing | Awesome app, great delivery times, wide variety of products and great deals! | love love this app.. | wonderful | Good value | so far so good! decent quality, great prices! | the games are iffy. it's hard to win stuff but the stuff you buy is pretty neat | until know every thing perfect | I love using Temu to purchase difficult to find items, as well as finding some of the best prices around!! | They are easy to deal with They are fast with shipping customer care is important to them | Great value quick service, very pleased | Sucks!, they offer and offer and say buy this you get this free and it's a big fat lie... shein is way better quality items. | Smooth | Great Savings! read product reviews to make informed choices. I've loved 99.9% of what I have purchased. | very fake looking | Temutshop.mickey | All items as described, very pleased delivery was within a week. | every thing works perfect thank you, | love is shop like. | The products are ok except the clothing which runs extremely small.

They just refunded my money without asking if I wanted to replace items, and now they are discontinued or not on sale anymore. | great deals on cool gift ideas | Good prices | Won't Let me delete.my information | The best platform,where I recommend everyone to shop | This is a pretty good place to order from. I recommend it | I love this site, there are a lot of great deals to be had, but you need to read the fine print or you could discover your item is smaller than you thought | good! | Excellent | Absolutely love the Temu app! I have used it numerous times to prepare for for multiple events, and couldn't be more happy with the ease of placing my order! They also keep you updated via email after the order is placed, for easy tracking of orders. I plan to, and will, be using the app a ton in the future! I already have my cart started for my daughters 12th birthday party in a few weeks! She used the app for her jewelry making. I personally highly recommend this app for people of all ages!!!! | At first I thought it was too good to be true! But after few deliveries I'm so satisfied 💚🌞❤ | Perfect products fast delivery | Overall, I have only been disappointed in one item out of seven. The delivery time is amazing and I am a customer for a long time. Don't be afraid to order something. | So far all has been good | Product damaged. Photos of damaged package and product were not accepted. I had to physically go to UPS for an undamaged box and ship it back and wait for inspection before receiving my refund. I then purchased the product from Amazon | so many negative comments but I feel it's one of the best shopping sites ever. | Good | What a scam at least wish is honest about it lol | I absolutely love Temu I've had loads of bargains on here and would recommend it 100% | App breaches data security | very good otems | Romba waste | no problems with anything I have ordered. | It sucks so bad its like a knock off of a amazon | easy to.use. great customer service | Good prices with very quick delivery. | love everything and all items that I have received. recommend to everyone... | Never had a problem with any items I have ordered, delivery is always by estimated date | Love Temu!! thanks for shipping free! ❤️❤️ | so far so good on my first batch of orders. | No one wants their information shared to all these people. | اغبى برنامج شفته في حياتي ، تدخل فيه ،يطلع لك شاشات وصور وبهرجة كتير، وتنسى انت عاوز تشتري ايه او ماتعرفش تشتري حاجة ، هم الديفولبر اطفال ٧ سنوات ؟؟ قمة التخلف والقرف | Because you don't get your package on time. | suprised so far all my order's are as I wanted..Happy customer so far.also delivery on time even earlier. | i love their items, they do delivery 🤓👌🏿 | all items I bought were great 👍 | Easy to use. | amazing site I love it and it's safe 👍🏻 | hello guys I just want to express my positive reviews with audience because There are no purchased reviews. this platform is amazing especially secure and I would like to thank all the team they are working in Temu. I have purchased more than 50 items and I am very much satisfied because they are delivering on time they are refund policy within 1 second and tracking is amazing product is also good and you know that if you pay more you will get more quality but cheap quality products are also ve | love wide selection of products | It's very cheap and very good so yeah it should deserve five star like I love this app I keep deleting it on accident which I probably shouldn't do so yeah it has like very cheap toys so yeah it has a lot of funny stuff I'm not trying to be dragon but I mean my mom got me a lot off of Temu like I love it so I think you should install it you can do it without signing and with signed in I do it without signs in so I can kind of just add things to my car just let my mom know what I want bye okay yo | All good | Love this place. They have all kinds of things. | They keep telling us about free gifts and telling us to invite people I do but I never get the free gifts that they had said | Im very upset 😤.! The water game and fish game are a waste of time. Everytime i get the last of 100% I never win and can never cash out. Temu only good for shopping. I'm not gone lie I'm a skeptic and this site was no exception. But not only did the drone come at no cost, but everything that I have ever ordered comes and works. There are instructions with everything that needs it. | I love love this place!!! I can't stay off of it. | great stuff and great prices | Awesome | This is way more good and it is reliable | So many items are just super buys. I buy mow fir Christmas + Raffle prizes eg% metallic shawls are totally splendid , just 1 example So very 3asy to order from home + post is super fast. Thank you all Companies. UK customer. | I love temu I have a large family and temu allows me to be able to shop for the whole family at an affordable price. | Good products and very quick delivery | Why can't I see what type of information that you collect and who you share our information with? | amazing app . | I've invited and had accepted over and over. I paid cash for last order and it's late( big surprise) and never once got any free gifts but others I know have and I've done same they did. Keep it. After I get what I paid for I'll never use your app again. Liars and beggers. And I've bought and got more than a few new members, but never enough and never get anything. Zero stars.. Not asking or bothering no more | fair price reasonably good quality on time delivery | everything I bought was great will buy more in the near future | great stiff just really look at sizes , inches, and colors. read product details thoroughly before deciding. I've been pleased with the products I've ordered. | the best I've ever made | Very nice quality goods at a very exceptional price | All of the items I have received have been excellent | So far, so good! Ignored warnings to beware of Temu & trusted it :-). Happy with goods but do request delivery to a store for collection, rather than have del.

That wasn't even the case 20 years ago when we had apps on Java platform. Y'all are funny here. Do your research, foriegners shop online more than locals. The reason is simple, they probably can't easily interact with shop attendants so online would be convenient but not in Czech Republic and other European countries.

Satisfaction. | Ok | Profi | Good app | The app is nice, works well, I miss a bit the category breadcrumbs on the subpages, but overall its great. However the local delivery in Hungary is ridiculous, I cannot pick choose store pick-up because the stores are ""ovewhelmed"", and the nearest free is 170 kms away...

Produsele sunt frumoase si spre calititativ! | It would be great if the application is also available in an English version. | Gut | Aplikacja łatwa w użyciu, przejrzysta.

Amateurs. | Easy to use | Smooth and easy to navigate | Nice | It doesn't communicate with my account on the website.

Mă chinui de o ora sa fac o comanda și nu funcționează. | I am trying to put an order but the app doesn't let me do it because my postal code is invalid, as there is no space for filing in the postal code nowhere in the form.

I added so many items to buy, and when im trying to place the order, i waste so much time looking for them again. | Could not place order. At the last step for payment it did not accept my order because it asked for the postal code. I had ordered in store delivery and the part of the form where I added my adress, there was no field asking for the postal code of my home address.

Je zde v podstatě jen 1 typ menu, což působí velmi přehledně(ne všechny banky to takto maji). Jediné co bych osobně ocenil, je zjednodušit přístup nastavení. Nepřijde mi příliš intuitivní aktuální přístup. Za mě bych klidně to ozubené kolečko reprezentující nastavení nechal v pravo nahore. | Zabugované jak prase. | Jednoduše nefunguje:))) Předchozí aplikace fungovala bez problému. Zajímal by mě důvod téhle ""nové éry"". Hrůza. | klasicka spatna KB, aplikace se instaluje a kdyz prerusite, musite jet znovu⛔ puvodni ucet se nenacte, tak KB znovu a lépe ‼️❌ | Aplikace mě nutí změnit banku... | Předchozí aplikace byla výrazně lepší.... Upozornění ke KB klíči mi nechodí vůbec, musím vždy v aplikaci najít záložku KB klíč a až potom potvrdit. Upozornění o zaplacení mi přijde až 30 minut potom co jsem kartou zaplatila... Kdyby někdo zneužil mou kartu, dozvím se to nejspíš až za hodinu. Za největší mínus ale považuji to, že si nelze zobrazit platby, které již proběhly, ale jsou stále blokované. Na účtu už mám tedy nižší zůstatek, ale nevidím, kam peníze zmizeli. | S aplikací jsou neustále problémy. Někdy prostě nemůžu aplikaci otevřít, teď zase ""nemám dostatečnou autorizaci"" abych někam poslal peníze?? V kritických situacích mi KB+ zakazuje přístup k financím, nebo nedovoluje si přetáhnout peníže ze spořícího. Jen díky tomu mám intenzivní frustraci z KB a pokud se něco mezmění, budu měnit banku. -------EDIT: Budu sem připisovat každý moment, kdy nemám přístup k penězům: => 5.3. - We're experiencing network issues! Check your internet connection! | Chci zobrazit detail uctu...nic, chci provest novou platbu...vyskoci okno ""zkuste to znovu"" pulka funkci nefunguje | Not all outgoing payments (manually input or from templates) are displayed on the account overview. Not even after couple of days. Even though the pop up confirms payment was successful. Can't keep track of the payments which is ridiculous and makes my life complicated | Nesnáším tuto aplikaci z plného srdce. Často nefunguje a pomůže jen restart zařízení. Často se zasekne při načítání před přihlášení, po přihlášení nebo při potvrzení požadavku. To pak znamená odstřihnutí od vlastního účtu... Když už náhodou funguje, tak stejně nic neumí, možná až na zobrazení zůstatku. ""Zabere vám to 5 minut"" To byla lež! ""Věříme, že aplikaci dáte šanci"" Ano, šanci jste dostali. Je čas odejít od KB. | A smart banking app that still doesn't let you see your card details (in 2024) is just useless | Jednodušší interface výměnou za nižší bezpečnost (místo hesla pin)? | The change mgmt of this migration is highly mismanaged. Will close down my account, my money wrongly spent on the rocky launch of this new environment. | Chaos, strasnej chaos, kdybych vedela, jak to bude vypadat, tak ten ucet zrusim. Neprehledne, nevidim kde se daji odesilat platby ani jakykoliv funkce, ktere byly v starsi aplikaci, hruza a des. Banky se snazi udelat bankovnictvi co nejvice jednoduche, aby to zvladl kazdy, jsem dite dnesni doby a stejne se v tom nevyznam. Odejdu hned, jak to bude mozne. | Horrible horrible app. Where is the option to issue a claim? Did they just remove that? Great. | aplikace postrádá mnoho předchozích funkci i Widgetu a je velmi nepřehledná, nerozumím k čemu je ten přechod na novou aplikace užitečný, asi jen kvůli změně u nových klientů se sazebníkem. | Pár maličkostí, které by potřebovaly změnu: nelze si změnit vzhled již stávající karty, nelze si v aplikaci sjednat kartu jinou než debetní (ani zlatá ani kreditní nejde), nelze si nastavit heslo jiné než 6 místný PIN, jazyk aplikace je stejný jako jazyk zařízení | Pri dnesni aktualizaci 18.1. Mi aplikace prestala fungovat. Proc? | Nefunguje radne. Nevidime kompletni seznam svych produktu a nefunguji screanshoty.Stiznosti do KB odeslany. Odpoved,ze jsme neprevedli radne,je licha. Nefunguji screanshoty,moznost pdf castecnych vypisu. Tuhle aplikace nechci.Neprehledna,chci zpet puvodni. | ""You don't have sufficient authorization"" správa ma sprevádza celou appkou i prechodom na ňu... Všeobecne by sa kb hodilo menej systémových zmien a radšej vylepšienie toho čo už je. Oproti iným bankovým appkám ktoré používam som musel v kb robiť najviac takýchto prechodov a appka je aj tak stále najhoršia... rozumiem, že budú časom inkrementálne robené zmeny, prečo je ale appka dostupná v tejto ""beta verzii"" už teraz? | ▪︎Hned po loginu chce hodnotit. Takže 1★. ▪︎Místo 6-16 číslic nebo 8-20 znaků je 6místný PIN. ▪︎MB skutečně potřebovala spálit a začít znova, její kód je rezavé klubko drátů. Ale urgovat mě hned si přijít pro NoVoU ÉrU bankéřka nemusela, stará appka ještě funguje. Vyřídil jsem si to doma a schůzku zrušil. Že to jde, pro ni byla novinka! ▪︎Vyhrazují si právo blokovat odemčený bootloader, čímž nutí klienty víc důvěřovat výrobci mobilu než sobě. ▪︎Nemají RaiPay. NFC jde přes Google, který vše vidí. | Registrace pres bankovni identitu nefunguje :/ | Nejvíc mě asi štve, že nejde změnit (respektive zvolit si) jazyk aplikace, zrovna bankovnictví se mi nechce používat v angličtině. Jinak jsem jí zatim moc nevyzkoušel, tak uvidíme. | Nejde přepnout jazyk než na jiný co má telefon (je tam volba v menu, ale nic nedělá) Aplikace má časté problémy kdy nejde platit, klikněte na položku a ""something went wrong"" a dal nereaguje | Worst app ever. Previous app was hell. They forced me clicking on some random stuff related to ""conversion to new banking"". Everything is same but you need to use this broken app. Just use different bank!! Avoid this hell. | Že by třeba v popisu aplikace bylo uvedeno, že je třeba počkat na pozvánku pro přechod? Nebo na to alespoň aplikace upozornila po stažení. Vše je stejně zkostnatělé jako celá KB. | Prosím přidat možnost přepnout jazyk. K čemu to je v menu, když to pak jen vyskočí hláška že je nastaveno podle telefonu. Vždy je dobré dát volbu uživateli. | Spoustu chyb při přechodu na nový typ účtu (podařilo se na pátý pokus, jinak chyby v průvodci typu internal server error), chybí zatím možnost pojištění přes aplikaci a stará aplikace už nefunguje. Porodní bolesti typu chyby při načtení stavu účtů. Something went při pokusu a platbu převodem přes QR kód pokud na chvíli dám aplikaci na pozadí 🙄 | They ""blocked my device"" with no explanation whatsoever. The only info you can see is ""call us at this number"". No one is at said number. Not even gonna start about the other stuff, like no info, it looking and running terribly. Horrible, feels like a low-key scam. | Nechápu, proč bylo potřeba přejít na novou aplikaci, stará fungovala dobře a dalo se na ni spolehnout. Nic z toho neplatí pro novou aplikaci, do které se většinu času ani nemůžu dostat. Proč, když už dělám novou aplikaci a mám k dispozici starou funkční, neudělám tu novou nejprve stoprocentní než ji vypustím mezi lidi. Hrůza | Funguje dobře, dokud se nepoužije možnost ""mojeplatba"" na alze: to je pak "" do tohoto bankovnictví nemáte přístup"" | Z ničeho nic přestala fungovat | Neprozřetelně jsem na pobočce nahlásil změnu na kontaktní adresu a teď chce aplikace přijmout tyto změny a po schválení to nahlásí chybu, že se něco nepovedlo a že na chybě se pracuje a od rána žádná změna, zítra budu volat do KB co se děje, aplikace nepoužitelná. [UPDATE] asi nějaká race condition s migrací, která trvala déle, než se prezentovalo, tedy po 3 dnech to nakonec prošlo. Autentifikace je v aplikaci pekelně pomalá a při přechodu z jiné aplikace se už neprovádí, což není moc bezpečné. | Onboarding jsem zkousel 3x. Pokazde me aplikace vrati na uvodni obrazovku at vuberu jestli jsem novy ci stabajici klient. Nechapu proc mi proboha z banky volali at na tenhle odpad prejdu. Ne dik. | Tohle se neda oznacit za nic jineho nez peklo. Nova aplikace temer nic neumi, chybi napr. i zakladni prace se sablonami. Mobilni i webova appka jsou fakt totalne oklesteny a doporucuji vsem, kdo nepresli jeste ze starych sluzeb, at se to snazi co nejvice oddalit a nebo radeji prejit k jine bance. I samotny prevod sluzeb do KB+ byl tragicky. | Super, bylo by fajn přidat výpočet kolik peněz dostanu z úroků na spořícím účtu. | Otřesný design jak z roku 2010, neschopnost přizpůsobení vzhledu a rozvržení aplikace, pomalejší než předchozí verze a hlavně extrémní nepřehlednost. Silně zvažuji přechod ke konkurenci. | I don't even have energy to describe everything wrong with the app. Just choose a different bank if you have the option unlike me. If you want to know why I'm giving 1 star, just use the app for 5 minutes. You'll quickly understand. | Přechod k horšímu, to že u pohybů na účtu nově nevidím status transakce (Booked, Cancelled..) opravdu nepovažuji za optimalizaci UX. Chválím integraci klíče, ještě zvládnout navigaci po prokliku notifikace. Schovat tento modul pod druhé menu je taky poměrně nešťastná volba. Za mě povedená první fáze implementace. To proč očividně neodladenou verzi aplikace posílá KB do ostrého provozu mi nicméně zůstává záhadou. Edit: Absence funkčního zaznamenávání platební historie je skutečně poslední kapkou | nelze spustit, nenahraje se ani možnost zadání pinu | Proč nelze nastavit jazyk aplikace jiný, než má zařízení? | Chaotic. At frst it fails. Why new pin? Why new bank account? Everything in this process is completely doubtfull for current users. Do not use the application! Looks completely like phishing stuff. Edit: So lets wait till the morning. I have succesfully created a savings account and as a result I do have two ?why? profiles in the bank. One original, the other one just for savings. | Špatně se načítá. Musím 3x minimalizovat a maximalizovat aby se apka načetla a já se dostal na účet. | KB se tváří že inovuje, ale v jádru je to pořád ta stejná banka která po mě vymáhala jeden haléř jako úrok z přečerapného účtu. | Myslím, že 3* jsou zatím adekvátní, aplikace toho moc neumí a upřímně nechápu, proč je ta aplikace venku tak brzo, když na to business očividně nebyl připraven a musí se zakládat nový účet. Aplikace neumí moc, ale chválím krok vpřed v designu (UX) a snad se s ní bude dobře pracovat i v plné verzi, jen vás chraň ruka páně, pokud nebude umět i podnikatelské účty tak jak MB, tak by znamenalo přechod jinam :) Taky doufám, že umíte kategorie jak revolut nebo bývalá Equa, pokud ne byla by to škoda. | Useless! Steals your data, then fails. You have to give them both sides of your ID, your driving license, a scan of your face, agree that they can use it for 5 years.

You cannot pickup a package without app install, email, phone, blueutooth and location access. And nobody tells you all this when you select shipping by packeta... Instant uninstall, will never use again. | Decided to try z-box delivery. Got an email urging to pay the cod amount in app. Downloaded the app. First thing i see, probably, a package for someone else (very distant delivery box). Unable to find where to enter card details or connect with Google pay. Frustrated. Terrible service. Poor UX. | Application was working well for pickups. But I cannot send package as the payment via card always freezes - app stops responding. | This app is an absolute trash. If I could give zero stars I would give like 6 times. Unable to use it without wi-fi as it says I am not connected to the internet. Surprisingly I was and stood near the pickup point for 20 minutes to make it work. DO NOT use this to ship packages. You say in the comments shipping and receiving packages should be easy and you are right, SHOULD. You failed miserably. At least you got my personal data and location information. Great job. | An app to open a package box. After phone and email verification. What a joke. After i get this package your app will be deleted for sure, never to be reinstalled. | I am currently planning to drive to the Packeta pickup point, but struggling to receive the verification code to my phone. As I am reading the rating comments this is not a unique issue, I am suggesting to get that generic issue solved. This is just not okay that I have to call for support for such a simple task... you should find another solution, such as pin code via sms or bar code via email. So that your customers are not having a negative experience. | worst package delivery app ever. the app doesn't work and they don't respond to emails. | No sms, no package. Thanks for not having a fallback method, like qr code or web site - first and last time I ordered into a z-box. | Fajn služba, škoda že nejde nahadzovať údaje zásielky na počítači, kde by sa dali z mailu pohodlne kopírovať údaje na zaslanie. Na mobile je to mierne nepraktické. | Useless. Sms message not arriving, even with 3 retries | Edit: seems it's due to maintenance, but you have to read the website to get this info. Would be nice if it was posted in the app itself. Hopefully it will work tomorrow. Won't let me enter my email. I get an error message 'oops something went wrong, please try again later'. Tried reinstalling, clearing cache etc, no luck..any help would be appreciated. Why not just use a code? Any time something goes wrong with the app you're out of luck getting your package. | Very good delivery app | App is not working, I could not log into or register. How am I gonna pick my parcel from z-box? | Vždy když chci poslat zásilku tak aplikace spadne. Po přeinstalaci se do aplikace ani nejde přihlásit a kód na ověření emailu hází error. Webstranka nema navic funkcionalitu takze nejde delat nic. Otevření záložky ""pobočky"" automaticky shodí aplikaci i když vypnu polohu | Always crashes with payment for me.....:((( | Pohodlné a príjemné odosielanie ale ceny by mohli byť zobrazené na prvej stránke pre lepší prehľad. | Neexistujuci support. Velmi amaterske. | This app actually deserves 0 stars, not 1, because it shouldn't even exist. Any other package service let's me unlock the locker with a simple code. Not this one. It's a shameless data grab, which takes a process that should normally take 30 seconds at worst, and turns it into a 5+ minute ordeal, requiring registration, phone number verification, location and bluetooth access. Shame on you. In the future I will make sure to use literally any other service when recieving packages. | Horrible idea, and a worse app. Opening the z-box through Bluetooth just so your fingertip doesn't touch a screen? Extremely poor excuse. First package was okay and I uninstalled. Now I need to pick up one more and the app freezes immediately when I'm supposed to input my phone number. You dropped the ball on this one, Packeta. Please take user feedback seriously. Canned responses won't do. Oops,an error occurred... | Mám přehled kde se balík nachází. Skvēlý nápad, škoda že Vám to Balíkovna takhle ukradla. | I think, that it is the best service, because it offers also returning items to eshops and paying for items | Procedure is the worst imaginable. As if someone compiled all the bad ideas of other services into one. Must: register email, phone number, personal data, enable Bluetooth, enable location, give access to literally everything, so the APP can get all package data, track your movement, and open the box automatically when you approach it. I use this only when I have no other option and than immediately delete after I am done. Edit: app is fine, works perfectly. 5 star if data harvesting is removed. | Měla by být možnost uložení kontaktů. | I am standing for 10 minutes and trying to understand how to open a locker. Just put a normal touch screen on the automatic box like all the other companies. For what is all my data needed? | Zdieľanie zásielky stvorilo použiteľnú appku. Nie je možné vymazať zapamätanú platobnú kartu! | Plná spokojenost. | Katasztrofálisan bonyolult. Más szolgáltatóknál megadok egy számkódot, odatartom a kártyaolvasóhoz a bankkártyát, és ennyi. Itt alkalmazás letöltés, kártyaadatok begépelése, email verifikáció, sms verification. Szóval katasztrófa az egész folyamat. | I received sms about having package in zbox but it doesn't appear in the app. Call center only has bot and no operator. I have restarted, installed on the other phone it didn't help. Finally only online support made something and it appeared. Yesterday i spent hours trying to make it work. Your call center is a joke only a bot demandin to say words instead of pushing buttons. | Jednoduché a rýchle, veľa pobočiek... spokojnosť | I have received an email + sms that my package is ready to be picked up, yet it does not appear in the app, so I cannot actually get my package from the delivery box. Very disappointing that there is no other option like a pin code to take over the parcel, only this malfunctioning app!! (yes I registered with the correct phone number...) | Na niektoré zbox sa pri podaní balika nedá vôbec pripojiť a Packeta s tým nič nerobí!!!! | I refuse to use this data harvesting app. There is absolutely no reason that this app needs as many permissions and information as it does. Uninstalled immediately, I will not pick up my order and will have it delivered through another service. And just because packeta ""follows the data protection rules"" doesn't make the data harvesting ok! Why is Packeta forcing people to download an app just to pick up a package? They say it makes the pick up quick and easy, which is bs. Don't use packeta! | Aplikácia mi zablokovala po dodaní na miesto výberu zaplatený tovar. Zákaznícka podpora je vo forme robota, ktorý opakuje stále to isté dokola. Mailová podpora regulovaná robotom, aj napriek priamej požiadavke, nezmyselná odpoveď, na ktorú treba odpovedať, aby vás ""riešili"" 0 bodov z 5. | Nefunkčná | Nula hviezdiciek keby sa da. Nic len trapenie. Vobec nenajde balik a neda sa vyzdvihnut. Horsi system som nezazil. | Wonderful app. I use lot of times. Delivery on time | There is no reason for existence of this app. Just send code through SMS and put payment terminal next to the boxes like other companies already do. The fact that you need to install one-use mobile app and enter personal information is such a pointless and stupid idea. You should fire the person who came up with it. Also it would be nice to warn customers about your practices before they order something. Now I feel tricked, because I wouldn't use your services if I would know how it works. | It's asking for an email when before worked fine with phone number | Wanted to pick up a delivery from a box, downloaded the app, but didnt get the verification text message. 20 minutes later I got all my verification messages in bulk. All of them expired. I couldnt receive my package!! Tried again, no verification message at all. Never experienced this before at any app registration. Just give a PIN in email like the rest of courier box services... | Pathetic that an app is necessary to get my package. Have you heard about the qr code? | 🚨IF YOU WOULD OF GAVE ME THE SAME INFO👉,WHICH YOU ONLY GAVE ME NOW IN YOUR RESPONSE TO MY RATING🤔,I WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY CLIENT(give u 5star)👌💯😈 | APPka byla by skvěla jestli by se dalo odeslat balik. Potřebují odeslat balik, ale když natukam už na payment, tak mi to dal nepustí, že se stala nějaká chyba. Pres počitač zasilku nejde zadat. Užjsem vyzkoušel všechny svoje karty, a žadna nefunguje. Nevím jak mám odeslat balik. Opravte to prosim. Alespon přidejte možnost zadat balik k odeslani pres PC, anebo alespon zaplatit za odeslaní na pobočce při předani. | Ooops, niekde nastala chyba. Trepal som sa vrátiť tovar. Nefunguje to. Kdepak ti soudruzi z NDR udelali chybu. Edit: ako konkrétne tom mám nahlásiť Z-boxu? | app - absolutely useless, generating ""oops error occurred"" messages without error code or any detailed information and there is no backup with entering pin... as for the service - they lost my 300€ package (picking up my box from your box and put it in another box - how is even possible to screw that?!?) and they refunded me 15€. certainly with accordance with terms and condition no doubt... so they actually dont need to deliver anything - they can be profitable just by stealing packages... | Disgusting data harvesting op. It demands your phone number, it demands your e-mail address, it demands location and bluetooth before giving you your package. None of these things are necessary when I could open the locker with a code like GLS does. This entire app is clearly superfluous, cynically deployed for data harvesting purposes. I was forced to use this once, then immediately deleted my account and the app, and I'll make sure never to order from anywhere that uses this ""service"" again. | I will never use this company again. Terrible service, terrible customer service, 1 month and I still don't have the package. No support, lies on top of lies. App works perfectly. But items are not delivered. The item is stuck in the z-box now for 31 days and I still don't have it. Customer service tells me each week that the technician is going to open the zbox soon. Every week they ask me to wait. But after 31 days, it's still in the zbox! Still zero! I will never use this company again :) | Ooops an error has occurred. | 🚨UTTERLY RUBBISH🤮Tried 1hour in the cold ,download app(WHY DOWNLOAD APP,FOR 1 PARCEL?🤣,)nowhere was in App to open Box,NO Phone to Enquire🤫then on Email i find Store inside Plaza,where I was told they got my Parcel😱Incorrect Info not HELP👊1st TIME USE & LAST TIME🫵NEVER AGAIN💯😡😈 | Proc delat veci jednoduse kdyz to jde slozite a pres aplikaci... Sdileni zasilky, ktere bylo drive preposlani emailu, se zmenilo na nutnost sdilet a MANUALNE (i banky umi QR kod/ platbu na tel. cislo) prepisovat idetifikator. Pro otevreni boxu je misto zadani kodu potreba zapnout bluetooth, povolit GPS a nejspise i zapnout data.

[edit: vase reakce je uplne mimo] | Trying to return a package from Hun to Cz via the Z box. Not possible as the app only creates a QR code which I cannot read at the Z box to open the door. Why would you tell your customers that they can return a package via the Z box if not possible? | Zbytečná aplikace. | Ted bývalí Zasikovna ted ne stoij za nic, covek ne zveda zajaznicka linka jen robot, na e-mail nygdo ne odpovida , poslal jsem zasilka pred 8 dny v aplikacie je na zatáčce, nygdy ne budu pouzivat navic v ta firma.

Bohužel | Well, it worked!! | Byli mi sebraný peníze ale neobdržel jsem zásilku | Nesiel otvorit Z-Box, vsetko potrebne som mal nainstalovane (BT, app, data), z boxu vysiel zvuk podobny tomu pri otvarani boxu. . Operator tvrdil, ze nevidi ziadny problem s boxom. Po piatich pokusoch som musel zasielku presmerovat na vydajne miesto. Packetu viac nebudem pouzivat, po tychto skusenostiach neodporucam vobec Z-Box | Bezchybná aplikácia, spoľahlivá služba. | Aplikacia sa neda spustit, zasielku si neviem vyzdvyhnut, ale ich to iba mrzi, aplikacia mi pravidelne neposiela overovaci kod ked sa tam chcem prihlasit | I have to download an app to receive my packet? What is this bs? | Completely idiotic, apparently nobody at this company expects someone from abroad to come to one of the countries where their terrible service is present and be forced to use them due to a third party vendor. No option for any phone number from a service provider outside of 4 or so countries, and their moronic system just rewrote the phone number the vendor sent them to start with +36 instead of the original country code so now the package is linked to a nonexistent phone number.... | Na Huawei nie je možné inštalovať apku. Veľká chyba | Should I do the delivery part too? | Pathetic that I have to download an app just to receive a package | It handles a specific user input error with a meaningless ""Oops, an error occurred"" error message. In this way, the user does not know that he has messed something up, or if so, what, but rightly assumes that there is a general system error. | I do not want to install your garbage software just to pick up a package. | Not showing pickup places. Unable to send parcel | It is the worst parcel delivery I ever used. Every other company can send a simple pin to pick up the package. Never will use it again. | Feature request. Nedal by se výběr místa doručení volitelně přepingnout na adresáta, aťsi sám vybere a pak bych už jen odeslání potvrdil a dokončil? | Saw a new option in getting a package, saw an app is...required?, App asks for phone number...you have yourself installed to a static phone ID and MAC address??? Why would you need a phone number? If phone number, why app? You could just set a pin in the ordering and link the device with it so only you'll be able to unlock the parcel? Or make the company send you one? Like everyone else? | Using Zasillovna is sometimes great and used to work without any app. Parcel was delivered to a shop nearby and I was very satisfied. But sometimes a package goes to random Z-box. I hate this. Even if I choose to use cash on eshop It only means that I will have to pay by card (no google pay) in this app which I do not want to have anyway. I want my girlfriend to pick my package for me as I do not have smartphone. This is aslo not possible. This scenario forces both of us to have app installed. | The delivery company in RO is a joke. They have 1 week delay and can not fullfill their shipment obligations. worst experience ever | Needs Google Captcha to log in for some reason, and the pickup point picker requires Google Maps. / No, reinstalling will not help unless I re-google my degoogled phone. No, I won't get GSF on my main device to be spied on! Please tell developers to remove GSF (Google Spyware Framework) dependencies, there are FOSS alternatives! | The app does not provide what expected ftom its advertisement. It does not give any real details about the parcel and why it is late. | terrible ux and the app is translated to english, yet you can't install the app if your google account doesnt have right country... Dear Nikola, it might be a surprise for you, but in cz,sk,hu,ro might be living people having home country different and you intentionally choose to avoid these customers... shame... | Sure you need an app and all my data to open a locker Edit: Hi Nicola from Zasilkovna! No, that's exactly my point, you cannot easily pick up packages. You need to download an app, verify your phone number, verify your email address, enable everything one-by-one in settings and then you will be able to open the locker. This is everything but easy. | Horrible that I am required to install an application to receive my package. Will avoid this service in future if I can. | Vsetko funguje ako ma. S appkou som nikdy nemal problem ci uz pri preberani alebo odosielani zasielky. | Aplikace je celkem použitelná, ale instalace emulátoru mobilního telefonu přidává zbytečné komplikace, když mohlo jít o obyčejnou webovou aplikaci. | App could be better, there's weird glitching and phone freezes up when filling in some of the text fields. Restarting the app resolves it. | It doesn't access my contacts so I have to copy/paste it manually in order to send a package. Very tedious if you have 10 packages to be send. The tracking functionality shows much less info than website. | Downloading an app just to get a package is annoying. On top of that it wasn't announced when selecting that delivery option. | If anyone is going to use this trash of a delivery service, don't ever choose Delivery boxes as pickup location as they are always full and your urgent package will stay with courier for 2-3 business days (might even be over weekend) until these imbeciles will find a new place to deliver. What's the problem of taking the package to another delivery place instantly when you see the box is full? | I'm more than just disappointed with this app. If you don't have it, good luck with opening the Z-box and getting your package. For people using Huawei services it is impossible to open Z-box since this app is only available on Google play or iOS. What's more, when I managed to download this app, it wouldn't let me get in anyway. It says that verification of my number has failed. What is the reason behind that? I had no other choice than to ask my family to help me with that. | couriers steal and somehow lose shipments of higher value packages ​​and packeta returns you only a minimum amount or nothing at all. Customer service sucks. Scammers | Alzabox je lepsi. Da sa platit kartou pri preberani. | Spravil som jednu objednávku, doručovali ju v 5 balíkoch, 4 doručili kam som zvolil v objednávke, 1 balík (akurát čo najviac potrebujem) do iného mesta. Žiadny dotaz, či si to želám doručiť neskôr, alebo inam, nič. Tak som volal (10 minút mi tykali a hrali hudbu), potom pani hovori, že to vraj presmeruju, ale musím počkať pár dní (čo už). A ze kam to chem. No akurát to nebude tam, kde bývam, ale do nejakého iného mesta! Toto čo je za služby?!?! Veď som si tu práve vyzdvihol 4 balíky?! Otras! | Výborná aplikace - je jednoduchá, rychlá a intuitivní. Jednu věc bych poprosil zlepšit - kdy vyhledávám pobočku pro vyzvednutí na mapě se zobrazí jenom pobočky podle filtru, ale často hledám nějakou vedlejší, tak další pobočky se pri zmenšení mapy neobjeví. Bylo by to hezké při zmenšení mapy zobrazit i další pobočky, které nespadají do filtru. Děkuji. | Nice, ale teraz uz cena za balík je taká vysoká, ze sa sami uz viac oplatí doruenie na adresu. Ostatne je ok Edit: zvycajne mam iba odoslanie zadarmo. Bolo by super keby Za balik bolo kolo 2€ | 1. Using ZBOX is a PITA and not really working, just a mess. 2. More recent, I got to know that the days someone is allowed to pick up a parcel are calendar days. This means that if the pick up point goes on a 14 days holiday break, the parcel will be returned to sender, because the recipient only has 6 days to pick it up. 3. Customer Support is useless at best and offending at worst. Twice already came out of it angry and dissapointed. Maybe just stick with Ceska Posta/PPL. | Why do I have to install and create an account, just to receive my package... | Celkem zbytečná aplikace. Sice se mi ukážou zásilky, ale bez jakýchkoli detailů (třeba času doručení nebo hesla pro vyzvednutí). Když zkusím zásilku přidat manuálně, tvrdí mi, že jde o neplatné heslo. Takže je to vcelku na nic. | To pick up parcel you need: i) inst app ii)bluetooth iii)gps iiii)phone numb iiiii) 20 min untill IA get your problem. Each implementation team should incl. psychogist who would explain to decision makers, that nothing simpliest as 4 pin code does not exisit and will not be invented in near future. As back up solution this should be implemented when any further upgrade considering. My problem was incorect spelled phone number. Simply problem. | Nepříjemná služba, ubohá aplikace. | Nincs funkció vintedes feladásra | Spent 10 minutes at the box to finally get my package. | dobra appka, ale urcite by som privital ukladanie/archiv adries pri odosielani zasielok. | Great service, great app. | You need this to open the locker. Guys, look around and learn from the user experience design of the whole hungarian delivery box market (excluding your) | POZOR! Svojvolne bez suhlasu adresata menia adresu dorucenia na novu adresu niekolko kilometrov od povodneho miesta dorucenia! A ked ich na to par minut po obdrzani ""informacneho emailu"" obratom upozornite, odpisu Vam, ze zasielku nevedia presmerovat na povodnu adresu, kym nie je dorucena na nimi zvolenu novu adresu! A potom sa na to aj tak vykaslu a zasielku nechaju hnit na novej nimi zvolenej adrese dorucenia.. | Přátelé, takto ne. K otevření boxu musí člověk poskakovat před boxy, instalovat aplikaci, potvrzovat email, potvrzovat telefonní číslo, povolovat oprávnění pro aplikaci... Z-box jsem použil poprvé a naposled. Toto lze vymyslet lépe. Stačí se podívat na okolní boxy. | The tracking in the app is useless. You get more details and updates on the website tracker than on the app. | The quality of service provided by Zásilkovna recently rapidly dropped. They seem they took too much work and they are getting lost in it. They are randomly redirecting your shipments to different locations, not caring that the locations are temporarily closed. They have big delays and their support is extremely hard to reach because on their support phone number is sitting just a dumb voice robot which is not capable of anything but hanging the calls. This is not complaint about one package. | vsetko olrajt | Have a day to pick up package, take a half day of holidays to be able to pick it up. App calims it is too late to pick up the package. There goes the Christmas present for my daughter. If ever a company says they are using this service I will do my best to find an alternative where they don't use this abysmal user experience | why should we use this? the other shipping companies can use qr codes in email instead of this application(foxpost etc.) | Switching to hungarian doesn't work at all..how did this ever get past QA? Needs to be hotfixed ASAP. Edit: The Google Play page is in czech as well. Maybe there is a misconfiguration on the play console? Edit 2: The package pickup feature randomly disappeared from the app. This is unacceptable. One of the worst apps I have ever used. It's so bad that as an android developer it makes me feel ashamed of my profession. | Rychlé, srozumitelné, spolehlivé. | Pro odeslání zásilky kupodivu potřebujete aplikaci na mobilu, i když webová by bohatě stačila. No a novém mobilu se do ní nemohu přihlásit - ""Ověření vašeho čísla se nezdařilo. Můžete to zkusit znovu."" Děje se to už pár dní. Snad není na přihlášení potřeba Google Play Services! Podpora je k ničemu. | Balíček se zaseknul na nějakém depu. Pomocí aplikace lze kontaktovat podporu pomocí emailu či mobilu Bohužel ani jeden způsob nahlášení problému nevede k řešení. Stále se mi nikdo neozval s informací, kdy bude balíček doručen | Can't register, you are supposed to receive a confirmation code via SMS, but it's not happening. | Straightforward and easy to use | Disaster of an app. Payments used to work at least 50% of the time before, but since last update they just do not work. I get a loading icon and then the app resets to previous screen with no error message or no way to do anything about it. Re-installing, changing payment methods -nothing works. What a joke. | Objednávam často z packety. Čo má mrzí je to že nemajú presnú lokaciu kde uvidím kuriéra. Bolo by dobré keby to tam pridajú | App is functional, but has Ads in the notifications. There is only one notification category so there is no possibility to disable the ad notifications. Be prepared, that your phone will be spammed. I received a response here, that there shoulbe 3 cathegories, but this is a lie. I see only one cathegory. Miscellaneous. One star. | Miezerie de aplicatie, companie etc....suport client inexistent...inutila 100%. Nici o jumatate de stea nu merita | Užitečná a přehledná aplikace. Jen jsem měl opakovane problem s platbou pri odesilani baliku. | Alza nepotrebuje žiadnu app. Kód príde cez sms email. Táto aplikácia vyžaduje polohu a ešte aj Bluetooth. Nečudoval by som sa keby sa prevalilo ze takto získané dáta predávate ďalej. Za mňa radšej balikoBox alebo alzaBox kde na vyzdvihnutie stačí pár čísel. |  | It wont open the box | Can't switch accounts on one phone number. | There is absolutely no need to install an application just to pick up an order from a shop. The fact, that there is no other option, even when you call the ""help"" line standing in front of the box is frankly outrageous. I have used Zasilkovna in the past, but will avoid it after this horrible experience. And based on the reply they employ people who cannot read. | The app is pretty much useless - does not show any details like the web tracking, does not show information from SMS which is sent in day of delivery. Basically just tells you the package exists. Waste of space. | Useless, no tracking available, late status change updates, support calls with Garbage AI. | Great app, super easy to send and receive parcels and packages. | Žádná aplikace mě tak spolehlivě nenasere jako když jdu vyzvednout zásilku v Z-Boxu. Úspěšnost je tak 30%, ve zbylých případech ""nastane chyba"". Nejlepší na tom je že na vyzvednutí máte jen omezený čas, takže se vám taky může dost dobře stát, že zásilka bude další den odeslána zpět! Kdyby to byl jen nějaký dočasný problém, tak to pochopím, ale s problémy při vyzvedávání se potýkám opakovaně a nelepší se to... I Česká Pošta má lepší UX a to je co říct! 🤬 | When registering app no possible to login with phone number. After typing number no possible to continue. This not working on Xiaomi 5. Mi9 is ok. | I ordered package with COD but after clicking on Pay payment gate will not open, so I'm not able to get package which is literally next to me locked in box. | Have to pass through captcha during login :⁠-⁠\ | Zjednodusuje dopravu balikov, ale appka je strasne spomalena pri platbach a preberani balikov. | Shuts down after update. Works as before after reinstalling. But another bad experience today - in the store app stopped to work, could not show the QR code. Had to use ID card :-( Several minutes before everything was OK. SMS sent by shopkeeper came just after the whole sad procedure was carried out... | Can't see my order. I can't open the zbox.... | Forces me to use an app to get my pacakge, because this is the only way to open the box. And only for my phone number, email and location data. Wow. | Aplikacia zial nefunguje. Ani po restarte telefonu. Podla google play update nepotrebujem, mam verziu 1.18.6. Kedze ocakavam balik do z-boxu, budem rada ak problem v aplikacii co najskor odstranite. nerada by som, aby sa uz zaplatena zasielka v nemalej cene vratila naspat odosielatelovi. Dakujem. Vymazala som cache a storage. Celkove preinstalovanie nebolo potrebne. Iba sa znovu prihlasit a urobit nastavenia tel.cisla..... | Chrashing after recent update - unusable | Had I known I need to download an app just to get to my package, I would've never chosen this service. Every other option just sends a code in text message. It's silly. | Useless application, doesn't work at all,after the verification for not being a robot,no SMS it's send to me | Unpeasant experience on first time use of Packeta. Could not manage to ship a package after paying for it. Customer service not available after 6pm, so good luck getting some help on later deliveries. Had to use Cargus app instead, much easier to use and 30% cheaper. | Cannot register, sometimes gives captcha sometimes just asks to to type in sms code. Which i do not get. Not even after multiple attempts, restart, reinstall... | Pickup of packet doesn't need an app, not everything needs an app, do it like everyone else, simply send a sms/email with code i can open it with, not downloading an app, register, give you a lot of info just for picking up a packet, then enable Bluetooth and location just so i can open the box. Just bcs we are pushed to download it doesn't mean we like the app, get better | worst delivery service I have ever used, they say that the package arrived in the box, and I was trying to open the ""z_box"" with banch of other people and it didn't work and their customer support is not even replying..do not recommend at all! | The box does not give the parcel till it's paid. That's clear. But there is no way how to pay. The app keeps telling you to update your contact info but even if you do so the payment is not possible. Worst parcel delivery boxes. I never had problem with any other delivery boxes. I won't use Zasilkovna ever again. | Can't even register properly Asks for a phone number, on the left side you can choose the country number pretext but when you try to enter the number it wants you to put a ""+"" in front. You have your pretext on the left! When I include the pretext, it is too long. I tried any reasonable way of writing a phone number but it's still invalid. There's not even an example. EDIT: Managed to register and also got a quick reply, so changing the amount of stars to show some gratitude. | nanutena aplikacia. iba neschopna firma vyzaduje na otvorenia boxu spustit aplikaciu na internete spolu s aktivnym BT a GPS... okamzite odinstalovana a nikdy viac | It doesn't work | Too much personal data collected for a shipment service! Thank you, but I'd rather use the web-site! Or just use Ceska Posta !! Edit: No, thank you Nikola. As I said I don't like the amount and type of data the app gathers. And yes, I did read the privacy policy! Not a chance to give it a chance! | It's beyond my understanding why they need so much access to personal info just to deliver a package. All the other poins use a code (and a qr code), not this level of invasion of privacy. How can I make sure now that this business dose not hold any personal info? | Coletul stă de 3 zile în Bihor | Vyzvednutí z boxu je oproti jakémukoliv konkurenčnímu řešení zbytečně složité a zdlouhavé. Aplikace náhodně hlásí, že zásilka byla doručena a poté až u boxu nahlásí, že zásilka je stále na cestě, zatímco v SMS zprávách stále svítí zpráva o doručení zásilky a vy jste vyhodili hodinu času cestováním k boxu. Prakticky neexistující zákaznická podpora, pouze bot na telefonu který na vše hlásí, že vám nerozumí. Měl jsem zasilkovnu vždy rád, ale jejich pokusy o digitalizaci jsou tragické. | They often change pick-up point without giving a chance to choose the more suitable one for me. I don't see any sense in using Z-Boxes anymore. Update: nothing in the spam folder | Skvělá práce. Nevím, zda M.Altair V. má něco společného s appkou, ale funguje přesně jak má. Čekám, zda bude zase nějaký game changer 😉 | I am not judging applitation itself but the service. They were suppose to ship packet in time but it is still in depot after a few days without any explanation.","{""1"":6852,""2"":860,""3"":1304,""4"":2646,""5"":29044}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Zásilkovna s.r.o.","Z%C3%A1silkovna+s.r.o.","info@zasilkovna.cz","https://www.zasilkovna.cz",,"https://www.packeta.com/privacy-policy","Z%C3%A1silkovna+s.r.o.","Business","BUSINESS","[{""name"":""Business"",""id"":""BUSINESS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0jO5LbpBefAjSU7l3fbr1jpqEoZ5-b5cxN9WwdhO7j68ychhQ4TWijGjbC_enISJdZXQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zZyQIsIMZFfALAH89HfDXFG8-gRyW9BQ51fBYt3ACH5w5VZmqz6WRwoPDs7JCH6j-g4f","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iFP-HIPmhAd2MqfXrzqZkqoOyAzxnS2EkI8tQbvwxj8X-mfv1j_F8J1HD09uPKnhAKI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xCHOw3Ky_BmQl9ds2wSS1FKc4TKRC-naVSay0rGKNOfARSRAWNf2bMe55aIKyNvTp_I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kT45p0uxa9i_jHqyVHSuubuCVIzDBJcyFiruzp05YYDQunYlf3LvGoftbOcVQtTbX2tB"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oJGcL-mcWgAjgcvfNWftEv-ZXN_edjsh0EKDFgXRQim58ndTkMZ7RuKS8-Je1oeeOQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hzuzs3NvDt7gG8wfkyvRGWJW4HT-p6XDZvPIeHIt2OF2-_HiAW4tEOEvNlEsCnqq-I8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wRpwoLtGn4lntkp1dDO-bxL8efZpr-Y3r-GXmRQALzeYNWfdA3ih1jUvmBlF1oGs3w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FufVmATUNxPZxsbowfSLbDU-6jbrkJEWaL97zJ3Fbd1JhWnukpLtRQXFznM5qtBA1vIe"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n5s8zcTRpfAPQaSh8uB54zACluiVycGQHUbFrLawKSfI2LvLensUp9WQvifw6g7b-mQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bXr9AXgEr3b4mL_ZXCZcdbIuj546Xfw1jZw3Uxgd0brt2SbXaRIvg4oSW28eQL_QUnk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8__MK9duvzaujxQ3jL3WHW6IJSbprx6ds0myiqqHKiJJ684SNjs_oHqviZl_WmF12A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zBhELlR1GVR2AxwR2bogAviW2uIFQY9cQBpJvl4cPJBoKujhejTxnZXwubgii0QRHroT"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KQz4BSgcAgKWDffSdRcDSrax1Uq4ly6IO4qdwjUpBp4kzshhD2A0Fr0p7RwcVzX12Mk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Qw16YSy9vWMT3wqMs0hHUuNC5cUIo5rspnh2Y1oHEsTNgnvvYgOYlDL2JQH54URIeHg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jg3Vl_MlDPI3KT0zQQaBj0Aa9dYA83IRWlzyBrAcC6uiuQdiXaM14JasuPS1DqD92Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xgb7_RAWZBySYtJGcYonAmr1tGjzOKlJBkMaGY4oCLNH5FZJWPNT6wAuFAV9IlSSGw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fN8XNpyAFnMYBD7l1ilCqptE_6o-BQv0cYN8CVLnDP0b0vm6N2ImwVDZ5iF1GkatKBM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bKF6FuV9cCnAfcZIwpO3kt28fuYfxgMbjq82wNoi_0YHfVSsJXpkMtqIX1tx1RSM2A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZDjThTsRuPW2rxvTsaa8ZKXFMtP4sWjVaOwYfKmIBIkkvS--jKs4f1Mx-I_1W2qodxQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sDbfKh269jpaPXEcaU8HMoLfIQuiMAglMuzqJ-nbV39D5TIBYwhhQP1k4r00fuR-Quol"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q5zMay7rJWiD_Qe8kn82q3j3xCyFXrBZ0z1U9Or_YGbSYpUQ3Yz7P_DqFnyLbvPWnA4S"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Xzs_0MngrdY0kkP7DM63aYppX9nP2tF8qAcHdtc17D0RqCinV7Rfs-e1cDPSW3FEhl8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qFBUkmPyqPlc_-iVJrkA7BV1QCwad3sQcMhlx34dJRoxMcEAlwfzwSGqA6rZURmRy5I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NcUfvwHlyKDchfh46IODdoqfdz0tW25MF2BUE3EHEbOKzpK_VY4WZwh1cHCNana3304"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ic6g-MPQx90ff1TJBaD3yNao71TpiKq0UAbeB2n9TemEXNRFKQXfIWWw7mGu6qgsU5c""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jan 14, 2019",1711110907000,"1.19.4","New simple, faster and more secure login process.<br>More user settings in profile section.<br>Other minor changes and fixes.","[""Horrible idea, and a worse app. Opening the z-box through Bluetooth just so your fingertip doesn't touch a screen?

You dropped the ball on this one, Packeta. Please take user feedback seriously. Canned responses won't do. Oops,an error occurred..."",""so, for normal person, for tracking packages, it's useless, and here's why. When you use the website, you can see at which points what happened, in the app you cant, you get an amazon style progress bar, without any actual info or times. The other thing is, it sends you a notification when the packages arrive. which you also get trough email, and since it's 21st century, that email also gives you a notification. Basically it offers less functionality than the website. :/"",""The worst experience with this app and Z-box. If you are lucky and there's no technical problems - everything will be ok. But if there's something wrong with the app - it won't show you the error message, nobody will answer to your email, customer support on the phone will be helpless. All they can promise is to send your parcel at another place - but that's lie, they actually will send it back to the e-shop without any notice. Never again!"",""If you don't have an app and the parcel gets sent to Z-box good luck - you can't open them manually. Also right now trying to send a package and application constantly keep spinning and loading, nothing happening.

If I can't send the package in next 10 mins will sadly use CPost, because this is ridiculous."",""Complicated parcel pick-up process: While the overall EN localization of the app is OK, the message shown after parcel pickup is 'Parcel Withdrawed'? Surely that's not right :) Then, the 2 minute countdown starts to reopen the box and the only way to stop the clock is to click a red Cancel Pick-up button... Which is confusing: I already picked up the package, why should I cancel? :D So instead, I just walk away and the app says bye to me with a nice NO SIGNAL error message.

Ne nadarmo.. vsak byl zakladatelem Albert Speer. | Been using this for one year with no benefits... the need to activate coupon to get points to get few crowns discount in incomparable with Tesco benefits where i'm saving hundreds of crowns for the same amount of spending. | Pri pouziti nakupniho seznamu se po odebrani nektere polozky zobrazuji stale. Presneji jde o tri polozky, ktere nelze smazat. Nacitani caroveho kodu je po aktualizaci rychlejsi, ale ocenil bych i moznost jeho vytisteni coz by bylo zdaleka nejrychlejsi. | It would be nice to have a English version of the app. But as I was informed, the app works fine in Czech language. | Pls add english as an option waiting for the language update since more than 2 years now. | No English language. Can't use the app. | Aplikace je celkem pomalá i na rychlém telefonu. Navíc neumožňuje sdílet nákupní seznam se všemi detaily, takže si musíme posílat snímky obrazovky, což je velmi nepraktické. | ""k pouzivaniaplikace je nutne si overit emailovou adresu."" Ok myslel jsem ze jsem ze jsem udelal, a stoji lidi za mnou ve fromte ale ok. ""Emailova adresa je jiz overena"" Ok.... tak me prihlas? zpet tedy. Stejny problem. Ok zaplatim bez slev a kontaktuji zakaznickou podporu. Kliknu ""kontaktovat podporu"", nic se nestane. Parada. Jediny cim by mohla tato aplikace byt jeste horsi je kdyby v ni byly reklamy na raid shadow legends. | Celkom fajn, ale počas prehliadania aplikácie nie je možné zvýšiť intenzitu jasu obrazovky. Rozumiem, že pri skenovaní kódu karty sa jas zvýši, ale prečo je pri ostatných akciách v aplikácii jas znížený tak, že je obrazovka takmer nečitateľná a nedá sa manuálne upraviť, to fakt nechápem. | Aplikace docela fajn, i když je trochu pomalejší. V poslední době nefunguje filtr na recepty při výběru chodu. | No English menu. The digital receipts are hard to access. | naprosto otřesná, invazivní aplikace | nefunkční aplikace, hlásí bez připojení k internetu, ale ostatni appky běží online | Diky teto aplikaci jsem zacal nakupovat v Bille. Dopurucuji IT diletantum, kteri tento soubor bugu zaplatuji, aby se na to vykaslali a nenutili lidi tuto parodii na program pouzivat. Az budete mit neco funkcniho, radi se do Alberta vratime. | Žádné sdílení nákupních seznamů (sdílení textového seznamu názvů položek je k prdu), vlastní nákupní seznamy čas od času zmizí, v rámci propojených účtů má každý jiné kupóny a nabídky, ze seznamu se nejde prokliknout na produkt. | Appka se rychle načítá, což je plus, ale za každých 200 Kč se skutecně kredit nenacte. Btw doporučuju lidem samoobslužné pokladny, protože na obsluhovaných se často něco špatně namarkuje a nebo se při větších nákupech ztratí čast zboží. | Na mobilu dobrý, ale na tabletu je UI rozbité při používání na výšku i na šířku. | Bad app. Tried to register, added phone number, filled verification code and after 10 minutes od loading the app is still stucked on verification. After 5th attempts, I gave up. | Aplikace mě neustále otravuje s tím, že se necítí bezpečně. Navíc je příšerně pomalá v některých sekcích. V obchodě nemám čas čekat minutu na to, až se mi ukáže karta, a to je škoda, takhle ji otevírám jen výjimečně a čárový kód raději skenuji z mé aplikace na poznámky.. Edit: Aplikace je pomalá nezávisle na konkrétní verzi OS, navíc je 2 dny po instalaci. Těm změnám se mi nechce věřit, od začátku je můj kód stejný, ale dám si na to pozor, abych měl v poznámkách aktuální verzi :) | aplikace neumožňuje sdílet více účtů mezi sebou, pouze dva v jeden okamžik. pro mou čtyřčlennou rodinu je toto nepřekonatelná překážka. edit: chápu, že si další dvojice mohou založit další společné účty, nechápu však proč by sdílený účet nemohl probíhat i mezi čtveřicí | Nákupní seznam na problémy - již se mi dvakrát stalo, že jsem si ho doma vytvořil a v obchodě byl prázdný. Teď jsem si ho zkusil vytvořit doma - vydržel mi, dokud jsem nezavřel aplikaci. Po jejím znovuotevření z celého seznamu zbyla jen asi čtvrtina, což je frustrující. Dá se s tím něco dělat? Jinak na Albert aplikaci oceňuji přehlednost, jednoduchost a právě tvorbu seznamu, který ale teď nefunguje. Na druhou stranu je appka pomalejší. Edit: doporučení devs na promazání paměti appky funguje. | Nejlepší ❤️❤️❤️ | Zákaznická podpora jako peklo. Reakce na stěhování im trvá vice než měsíc. Pak došli do "" prosím ukažte účtenku "" . No jasně, ja doma mam jednou skříňku jen na blbé obchodu a jejích "" podpora"" . Nejnižší kvalita zboží a obsluha. Rozhodně nedoporučuji nakupovat v albert. | Stojím u pokladny a chci zobrazit čárový kód. Pustím appku a půl minuty koukám na logo Albert, snad abych nezapomněl, kde jsem. Proč to není tak, že pustím appku a hned vidím kód (pro který tam jdu 9 případů z deseti) a až pak se začne načítat ten zbytek? | Účel, totiž elektronický si sbírat body a kouknout se co je zrovna v akci, pro mě splnilo. Účtenku jsem si taky vyexportoval a mohl jsem ji tak poslat kamarádům aby jsme se podělili o nákup. | Nefunkční aplikace. Hlásí to, že pro pokračování to vyžaduje ověření emailové adresy. Zadáte svoji emailovou adresu a napíše vám to, že adresa již byla ověřena. Kliknutí zákaznické podpory, jako třešnička na dortu, též nefunguje. Ale hlavně že spamování notifikací funguje! | Prosím udělejte něco s tou rychlostí, tohle je opravdu nepoužitelné. Člověk si jde rychle koupit pár věcí, během dvou vteřin má namarkováno, a pak nekonečné dlouho čeká na otevření aplikace, jejímž hlavním účelem je ukázat hloupý čárový kód. | Well | You should take an example from the Globus app. 100 Albert apps for each task isn't really good move in 2022. 16.6.2023 Update: Great move of integrating albert scan into this app. Unfortunately, automatic points topup based on what I scenned isn't working. I still have to scan my Albert card separately, to get the points from shopping, what is not really convenient. | V aktuální verzi (11. 6. 2023, Android 13 May 5 update) nastavuje jas na minimum, bez ohledu na systémové nastavení. Při zobrazení Albert karty se jas vrátí na původní hodnotu, po zavření karty se aplikace opět ztmaví. Při přepnutí do jiné aplikace se jas vrátí na původní hodnotu. EDIT: Z odpovědi je zjevné, že ""Albert Česká republika"" moc nečte, co jim uživatelé píšou. Neřešil jsem, že se při zobrazení ""karty"" rozjasní, ale to, že ZTLUMÍ jas telefonu na minimum, takže je nepoužitelně tmavá. | Albert, stojí za to jíst s aplikací! | Aplikace se neciti nejlepe | Aplikace nejde spustit, po nekolika mesicich jsem apce chtel dat druhou sanci, ale je to bez sance. To je tak, kdyz to programuje brouk pytlik za 5penez. | Dřív jsem rád nakupoval i nekreditové věci, i když byly jinde o něco levnější, protože jsem za každých 300 korun dostal kredit. Teď po zrušení systému už k tomu nemám žádný důvod, a tak v Albertu nakupuji o hodně míň věcí než dřív. Co se aplikace týče, ocenil bych možnost zobrazení počtu kreditů za zboží v košíku (ideálně zobrazení celého infa o zboží po kliknutí). Momentálně musím vyjet z košíku, otevřít celý leták a manuálně zboží vyhledat. | Nákupní seznam se neukládá. Včera jsem si vytvořil seznam pro sebe a dnes se v obchodě ukázalo, že je prázdný! | Please add English support. | Byl jsem navyklý využívat seznam. Nyní pořízený zmizne a v prodejně se dozvím že na seznamu nic nemám😞☹️😠 Tento problém neodstranila ani poslední aktualizace. | English language version as well please. Dekuji. | Just adding my vote for an English version even of it is just a Google Translate, as there a quite a few steps to go through to register and set it up it is hard to do as a non native speaker. | Aplikace je ok a funguje dobře z technického hlediska a UI je ok. Jedno doporučení bych měl. Aplikaci trvá nějaký čas po stisknutí ikony kde je třeba ještě 2x kliknout abych se vrátil na hlavní obrazovku a pak zobrazit čárový kód, což může způsobit další malé zpoždění. Používám mobilní telefon k placení (Google Wallet), kde je možné uložit a používat zákaznické karty rychlji. Bohužel není možné nahrát formát čárového kódu Albert ČR kdežto Holandský Albert Heijn je kompatibilní a dá se nahrát. | Velice casto dojde k tomu, ze se mi po zavreni aplikace smaze nakupni seznam. Jindy zase seznam nereaguje na pridani polozek- vse presto, ze vzdy kontroluji, zda mam aktualni verzi. | Should have English options 🙄 | It's been a year until now no English version 😔😔😔😔😔😔 | Cluttered UI, very slow, containts stuff that is pointless in an app for shopping: recipes (I wonder if they even collect statistics on usage lol), where is sales catalogue? No option to search for items if they are on sales... While websites like kupi.cz can do that for multiple shops/brands. Shopping list search function is very limited in terms of items available, looks like Albert doesn't have much to offer. STEP UP YOUR GAME. This app feels like customer bulling, not like serious product! | Stěžoval jsem si že aplikace u pokladny zdržuje protože místo toho aby při spuštění rovnou ukázala čárový kód tak při každém spuštění obtěžovala s opakovaným výběrem prodejny a neustále škemrala o povolení notifikací. Aplikace stále nemá možnost načíst čárový kód ihned po spuštění ale zdá se že po poslední aktualizaci si již pamatuje prodejnu a respektuje mé nastavení notifikací. Zvyšuji tedy hodnocení z 1* na 3*. | Opravdu frustrující aplikace. Skoro při každém spuštění se buď ptá na povolení lokace, povolení upozornění, nebo mě naprosto odhlásí. Načtení čárového kódu, což je jediný důvod proč aplikaci mám, trvá neuvěřitelně dlouho. Ztrácet čas zákazníků když stojí u pokladny, brilantní. | Aplikace se mi zpočátku líbila, ale ukázalo se, že je velmi problematická. Nejen, že se mi opakovaně stalo, že z ní zmizel pracně vytvořený nákupní seznam, ale téměř při každém spuštění požaduje alespoň dvě z těchto věcí: výběr prodejny/souhlas s cookies/povolení zobrazování oznámení (ačkoliv ho dávno má). Jejím nejpovedenějším kouskem je však vyžadování nového přihlášení a aktivace přes SMS, což s oblibou dělá, když chci zaplatit u pokladny a načíst zákaznickou kartu dostupnou pouze v aplikaci. | Not user friendly in comparison with Rossman and Tesco. I uninstalled it. It is very slow it doesn't not consider what user wants most: lightweight fast application without bloated advertisements. The user should find immediately his/her barcode and the collected points/benefits. Then he she can find quickly a submenu for finding nearby shops with opening time and special offers as well as possibility of online shopping and collect at a chosen shop. | 2022 and I can't choose my language. Hopefully this feature will come out soon. Thanks | Nepoužitelné, nedovolí mi to vybrat prodejnu bez povolení přístupu k GPS. Tím pádem je odepřen i vstup do aplikace. Na co tam tedy máte ten seznam prodejen?! | Pretty versatile app but the automatic scroll when going through this week's sale is literally giving me a HEADACHE! Also, it's unintuitive to find receipts from previous shoppings. Invest in UX | Terrible app, you can't even register e-mail, because it never send you the code. Avoid this. If you really want to save some money and nerves, try another store... | vždycky se z mojí rodiny všichni dobře nají a nakupujeme v Albertu hrozně rádi takže nemám co vytknout:) | Aplikace je dobra ale hrozne pomala, trva ji 5 vterin jen nastarovat abych mohl pouzit kartu. | How to choose English language in the app? | Doesn't support English | Aplikace se načítá moc pomalu, když za vámi stojí fronta lidí značně nepříjemné. Nebudu používat letí z telefonu | Doesn't work at all. Gets stuck at the registration sms. Rubbish. When you try to register five different phone numbers and the confirmation button never appears, it's not a mistake, it is a feature. | Nejde se přihlásit. Po napsání kódu z SMS mi to skočí na předchozí přihlašovací stránku. | The English language is not present.... | No english translation, which makes the experience way more difficult for foreigners | Upravuji své původní hodnocení (1 hvězdička z důvodu zasekavani aplikace). Po posledních aktualizacich je již aplikace svižná a použitelná. Velmi kladně hodnotím možnost vytváření nákupního seznamu a jeho sdileni. | App works perfectly. | Possible to add English Language...? | Like too shop at Albert in Litomersice,,.what I like the most,my Czech is not soo good,all the Albert staff is always very helpful and friendly. | N/A | Kdo vymyslel název Můj Albert, místo Albert? Když chci mít čistou plochu jen s pár ikonami, tak app albert tam nedám, protože ji využívám minimálně - mám ji v katalogu aplikací a ten je abecedně. A při scrollování si vždy položím otázku z úvodu. | Převádění bodů nefunguje, po kliknutí na Poslat body se nestane nic. Sdílení účtu nefunguje, po kliknutí na Chci sdílet svůj účet se nestane nic. | Musel jsem systémově zakázat notifikace protože mi neustále chodily i přes zákaz uvnitř aplikace. | Aplikaci používám jen na zobrazení čárového kódu. Musel jsem zakázat mobilní data, protože aplikace přenáší víc než 100 MB dat za měsíc. Taky nevím na co aplikace potřebuje přístup ke kontaktům. | Mohla by to být skvělá apka, jen je třeba vychytat pár much. Jmenovitě neaktualizují se mi kredity, jsem zaseknutý na 22. Když si chci vytvořit kupón, převod kreditů se neprovede a je třeba restartovat apku, aby se změna projevila. Sekce s recepty je skvělá, ale předpokládal bych, že při změně porcí se mi změní množství surovin. Celkem očividné chyby, nechápu, jak se dostaly přes testy. | Superb | Už asi týden se aplikace sice otevře, ale pak se vše jen načítá, nic se neukáže 😞 | S aplikací jsem velmi spokojen. Bylo by možné přidat do části ""Můj seznam"" výpočet celkové ceny plánovaného nákupu? | Po každé aktualizaci to vyžaduje přihlášení = aktivace přes sms. Po POSLEDNÍ aktualizaci to sice aktivační kód přijme ale aplikace se vrátí zpět na stránku zda li chci registraci nebo se přihlásit a porad dokola... Vtipný taky je odkaz na zákaznickou podporu, na kterou nelze kliknout. Musel jsem aplikaci ODINSTALOVAT a pak znovu NAINSTALOVAT. Posledni dobou mi pripada (pripad i aplikace ZACHRANKA) deveopri kaslou na ztratu prihlaseni po aktualizaci. Je NUTNE, aby i po aktualizaci prihlaseni ZUSTALO aktivni. | Aplikace je velmi pomala a nefunguje sdileni uctu - poslano na podporu A nová verze - teď se mi pro změnu zase neaktualizují kredity v peněžence abych si je mohla použít. Nákup se zobrazil, v historii kreditů jsou taky zobrazené ale v peněžence nic. Edit: odhlásit a přihlásit pomohlo. Hvězdičky budu přidávat až když to bude nějakou dobu prostě fungovat | No English version | Are the developers using this app in Albert stores? It is absolutely frustrating to use it. Notifications pop up over the bar code non stop, app is soooo oooo oooo slow to load. I have to load it while shopping otherwise at the cash register people will curse me if they have to wait for it to load. Check Tesco app for inspiration if you lack it. That app is well xesigned and has a very nice feature:barcode on the first screen. | • Nemožnost přidat jakýkoliv produkt, jen ten který vám ukážou v aplikaci. • Chyba s kartou, ukàzala se tam sleva, i když už byla využitá. • Nesouvisí přímo s aplikací, ale odpovědi v češtině na recenze v jiném jazyce mi připadají hloupé, protože tu žijí tací co mluví jen Anglicky nebo Ukrajinsky. | Aplikace dost pomalu startuje když v obchodě potřebuju rychle zobrazit kod, ale hlavní problém je, že mi nejde načíst kod na samoobslužné pokladně. | Umysl asi dobry, provedeni ... , nejsem schopen vyplnit ani svuj profil, 2x jsem restart.app, nic. Jak k takove veci ma mit clovek duveru, je to skoda, pripada mi, ze je Albert seriozni znacka a tento produkt i dle rezenci tomu vubec neodpovida. | How do you change to English? | Only Czech no English is some problem for me. | The application text is too small on the screen. The change of application language isn't possible. | I love the shopping list and how I can easily add products there, that is really helpfull especially during shopping - everything in one place 👍 BUT - the SLOWNESS of the app makes me crazy 😡 Enjoy waiting tens of seconds before something happens... It's like you're not even trying to fix it. | Proč mne nahodile (asi po aktualizaci) odhlašuje (ač 8/4/21 bylo řečeno: víme o tom a opravujeme). Práce se seznamem vybraných položek: proč je tak pomalé odebírání položky ze seznamu, proč se pořadí sekcí občas nahodile mění? Detail zboží nejde ze seznamu otevřít. Fotka na detailu zboží nejde zoomovat (např. přečíst si text ""složení"" na obalu), ale vzhledem k tomu, že je často fotka jen z pohledu bez složení, tak to vadí jen málo. Nevidim efekt volby preferencí bez lepku, bez laktózy. | Většinou funguje, jak má, občas je poněkud pomalá a trvá to. Odpověď vývojáři: co aplikace chce, je optimalizace na straně vývojáře - ne radu, aby si lidé mazali mezipaměť. Aplikace neúměrně spotřebovává zdroje, tak s tím něco udělejte (namísto rady ""mažte si paměť). / Na druhou stranu je aplikace velmi progresivní: sbírání bodů v apce namísto lepení koleček na papír a vytváření/sdílení společných účtů v apce jsou funkce, které leckdy konkurenti pořád ještě neznají. | Nevidim uctenky starsich nakupu jen toho posledniho. Recepty se nezobrazují, jen filtry. Zkousel restart i smazat keš. Doporučení vývojáře Odhlásit/Přihlásit odstranilo nyní veškeré problémy. Načetly se i kreditní body, které tam předtím nebyly :-) Díky! | Podporuji své kamarády, kteří se na vývoji podíleli, pěti hvězdičkami ❤️ | I was surprised that there is no option to switch the language to English... useless | Aplikace je nepřehledná a chybí možnost smazat historii nákupů (účtenek v aplikaci). | I like and want this apps but I maybe this apps is only for this country people not in foreigners because no English we need to translate and it's hard so I uninstall this apps | Čtení karty v mobilu funguje velmi špatně na samoobslužných pokladnách | Aplikace neustale zamrza a nefunguje. | Moc praktická věc, aspoň se trošku ušetří za papírové účtenky | Dobrá aplikace. Ale nedostávam body. Vůbec... UPD: teď dostávám body. +1 hvězda :) ale 15 body jsem stratil v tento kampaní. Tak pouze 4 hvězdičky | The slowest app I have ever seen. | Dobrá appka, funkcionalit dosť, ale tragicky pomalááá... | stopped working after update, lost all credits | Dobrý nápad, docela i funguje, dokonce se zlepšila rychlost loadovani aplikace, což byl ohromný opruz pokaždé u pokladny. Ale. Dostat na obrazovku můj kód je prostě porod. Dneska mi to přes čárový kód zobrazilo 'notifikaci', takže nešel načíst. Pokus o dismiss notifikace skončil zobrazením stránky s nabídkami...omg. | Přestalo fungovat převádění kreditů na slevu, takže už mi bohužel k ničemu není... Edit: Pomohlo to, děkuji! | Aplikace na zacaku fungovala,ale ted uz mi nenacita nakupy,tim padem ani body za produkty. Takze je mi vlastne k nicemu :( | Very slow application | Vyuziti nasbiranych bodu naprosta tragedie. Nasbiral jsem za x mesicu vice nez 200 bodu, promenil je na slevu v Kc. Tu jsem dnes chtel uplatnit. Na terminalu to napsalo chybu nacteni vernostnoliho programu. Pani z obsluhy to odpipla a nic. Zaplatil jsem plnou cenu nakupu a bidy fuc. Na muj dotaz me pani odkazala, abych volal na podporu, ze mi nepomuze. Ne diky. Jedina pridana hodnota je fakt, ze diky tomu nemusi tisknout uctenky. Ztrata casu to pouzivat :(((. Rozhodne nedoporucuju!!! | Neskutečně pomalá a kredity se často nenačtou. Asi nejjednodušším řešením je aplikaci smazat a pokud chce někdo využívat výhody věrnostní karty, tak začít nakupovat v řetězci, který má fungující věrnostní program. | It clould be a good app. But it is problematic and toooooo slooooooow | I přes vypnuté všechny kategorie notifikaci mi aplikace každou chvíli nějakou akci v notifikaci hlásí | Another request to have English language in the app. | Dvě hvězdičky proto, že se mi párkrát podařilo ušetřit díky nasbíraným bodům.. ale aplikace jako taková je katastrofa, zdlouhavé načítání, než se vůbec otevře a načte kód, a navíc se mi teď zasekla úplně a už se mi neaktualizuje ani nabídka, ani body.. | No translation renders it useless. Good try | Aplikace je žalostně pomalá i v novější verzi. Práce s nákupním seznamem je za trest. | Pointless app | Dobrý den, nefunguje mi v peněžence přesunutí kreditů. Jsou nějaké možnosti jak to opravit? Děkuji. K Dobrý den, už mi to funguje. Odhlásila jsem se a znovu přihlásila. Děkuju za tip. Klára | It is trying to do a good thing and be a good app, yet it logs me off every second day, it shows me unmovable pop ups again and again on the startup and all of that for the app, that 95% of usage is right at the cash desk! I didn't use my card over a dozen times already because the app did one of these stupid things, not letting me to the barcode itself with a bunch of people in a queue after me. | The app is not bad (from the UI perspective) but the fact that is so slow makes the whole experience quite bad 🙁 99% of the time I just want to open the app and show the barcode ... To get to this point it literally takes almost forever...and at this time I'm about to pack my food but I can't because I'm waiting for the app to open and then waiting for the barcode to show 🙁 | Nápad dobrý, ale aplikace je neskutečně pomalá a když ji mám u pokladny spustit a ještě u toho vykládat nákup, tak je to fakt za trest. | Aplikace je absolutně nepoužitelná, dlouho se načítá, nato že celá pointa aplikace je ukázat čárový kód tak to absolutně nezvládá | Cokoliv chci zadat do nákupního lístku, zboží nenajdu nebo ve výsledcích figuruje hlavně alkohol. Ne zrovna nejzdravější zboží. Edit: Když nejsem registrovaný a používám aplikaci poprve, tak žádné preference nemám. | Use case: open the app, open the barcode. What always happens: popups (inside the app) appear on top of the barcode. Have you tested it at all? | Dobrá appka, jen to načítání je dost zdlouhavé, když potřebuji rychle ukázat kartičku u pokladny. | No option to delete profile. Weak promotions: collect 20 credits and change them for 20 czk. Really? :) | One more to the English language version requests, but one more thing. In my penezenka / nakupy I have 17 points (body) but in penezenka / body it shows only 4 (Later edit after developer response) -> I am missing 13 points in the application. There should be 17 according to the purchases I've made, but there are only 4. I've lowered one start because of this response you've made. | Registrácia je možná len pod českým telefónnym číslom | English version still missing. | Aplikace je dost pomalá, interakce dost dlouho trvají - nevím, jestli mám na něco čekat nebo tapnout znovu, protože první tap aplikace nezaregistrovala. Mobilem to není. Zároveň swipování mezi obrazovkami není úplně dokonalé. Často se děje to, že chci swipnout něco v rámci obrazovky, ale swipne se mi celá obrazovka a naopak. Odhlašování a přihlašování se do aplikace na to nemá vliv. | Na účtence chybí informace o tom kolik kusů daného produktu bylo zakoupeno. To je zásadní nedostatek!!!! Přidejte možnost současně nastavit jednu prodejnu typu supermarket a jednu typu hypermarket. Obě budou aktivní jako ""moje prodejny"" (nabídky se výrazně liší a pro jejich zobrazení je velmi nepohodlné měnit ""mou prodejnu""). Aplikace bude mít záložky ""můj supermarket"" a ""můj hypermarket"" a zobrazí nabídky z aktivní záložky. Bez tohoto je aplikace dost nepohodlná na používání. | Aplikace se otevira velmi pomalu a po otevreni jeste minutu nereaguje a nacita se. Pri nutnosti otevreni u pokladny je to velmi neprijemne. | Kdyz jsem dneska chtel nascanovat kartu (resp. jeji carovy kod), byl tento kod relativne dlouhou dobu castecne prekryty jakymsi upozornenim, coz u pokladny neprijemne zdrzovalo. Take zmena orientace telefonu zpusobovala, ze kod zmizel a objevila se jina obrazovka. Zvazil bych, jeli nutne, aby obrazovka s kodem karty zvysovala jas telefonu na maximum. Z nejakeho duvodu mne tato vlastnost rozciluje. Jinak dobre, zejmena ocenuji, ze nemusim myslet na papirove uctenky. | Stokrat jsem uvadel svoje tel.cislo abych se mohl zaregistrovat a nic. Zadna neprisla | Kód poslán až na 15tý pokus. Registrace vyžaduje trpělivost. Nefungují tam bodíky - nic nevidím, nevím, nač sbírám, nejdou mi ani vyplnit údaje - nefunkční Link. Jinak app dobrý nápad, cením nákupní seznam a přehled... | Translated on Google Translate: Dobrý den. Možnost přeposílat nasbírané body někomu z rodiny na jejich aplikaci by se hodila. Děkuji. Taky anglicky překlad. | Nice app | Opraveno. Vše funguje. Díky 😉 | Neskutečně ale fakt neskutečně pomalá aplikace. Na mobilu za 10tis kde všechno běhá bleskem, byste z tohoto při používání zestárli. Vytvořit si nákupní seznam tady...to byste vyletěli z kůže. | Ocenil bych export účtenky v nějakém strojově čitelném formátu jako třeba textové pdf, html, txt, json,... (ne jako obrázek) a možnost automaticky zasílat účtenky emailem. | Requires a phone number, which I am not willing to provide | Vyžaduje mobilní číslo na registrace. Tak to ne. E-mail by měl stačit. | Bylo by dobré implementovat seznam v aplikaci na cloudovem reseni, kde by mohla vepisovat celá domácnost na různých zařízeních a všichni by stále viděli synchronizovany seznam. Taktéž vyřešit společnou appku pro X členů domácnosti, i když appka naštěstí povolí přihlásit se na více zařízeních pod jedním tel. číslem. Diky | Málem jsem dal 1 hvězdu, ale nakonec se stačilo odhlásit a znovu přihlásit a většina problému zmizla. | Naprosto k **** aplikace a jí podobné, když už děláte tyto appky tak by vám alespoň měla fungovat registrace! | Otřesné, prakticky žádné funkce nefungují. Prodejna nelze vybrat /změnit, účet nelze sdílet, preference nelze upravit, nic se nezobrazuje. Aplikace naprosto nanic. | Takovou hrůzu jsem už dlouho neviděl. Nastavení oznámení přepnu, uložím, vrátím se zpět a je to naopak. Účtenka se mi nevytiskla, ale v aplikaci je nastaveno, že chci účtenky. Navíc v aplikaci moje účtenka chybí. Bod jsem nedostal, že je digitální v aplikaci, ale v ní není a je nastaveno, že body nesbírám v aplikaci, navíc to nejde změnit, a že aktuálně ani neprobíhá žádné sbírání. Tady snad nefunguje jediná věc. | It's been 3.5 months since the last English request. Has this function been added yet? If not, why not? And when can I look forward to this? I will download it again when it does. | Mnohem lépe zvládnuté, než třeba stejná aplikace od Lidlu, oceňuji hlavně to, že už není třeba vytisknout ani centimetr účtenky. Velikou vadou na kráse je ovšem to, že nefunguje se samoobslužnými pokladnami a není to u nich ani nikde zřetelně napsáno, takže to zjistíte až když si na konci nákupu zavoláte na pomoc obsluhu... | Moc pěkně udělané, akorát by to chtělo více kreditů! :D | Celkem dobré, má to velký potenciál ke zlepšování. Občas se seká. | V nejnovější verzi už funguje i pro jiná města než Jihlava. A vypadá celkem dobře a přehledně. | Funguje jen v Jihlavě, nechápu proč. Betatesty aplikaci obvykle probíhají nějakým způsobem neveřejně právě z důvodu toho aby nedocházelo k situacím jako že nehotová věc se dostane na veřejnost a uživatelé sem budou úplně zbytečně pálit hejty. Anebo se jedná o hotovou aplikaci a Albert se z nějakého důvodu rozhodl že bude použitelná jen v Jihlavě. Havlíčkův Brod na jaře 2021, Brno léto 2021, Praha 2022 a zákazníci v Aši a Ostravě se můžou těšit v roce 2025! | Nepoužitelné zřejmě mimo jihlavu | Nerozumim proc je to jen pro Jihlavu? | Nákup položek dle receptu. 👍 | Super recepty! | A bodíky sbíráte? :-)","{""1"":1428,""2"":344,""3"":577,""4"":749,""5"":3698}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Albert Česká republika","Albert+%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+republika","info@albert.cz","https://www.albert.cz/aplikace",,"https://www.albert.cz/podminky-pouzivani","Albert+%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+republika","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tX2x_y-xnYFUTb-QMuD9lKidHBXlLSrIdLlNwBraPLwrQvQ2oao776vofYuQjeoQ3ZU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bkcmgDP9kfkl4Vg6wxhAaMVv4pwZg_IyRfsLbwkJkND3uchPFzCf2Y0pilCwcYZdb7A","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d3DPjdFFv_v-ikT-RtoouEFWxCoGsq5nbUUEdHrcRxqbeMU2Q_IJDy4sa0KbbrHuqaGc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gvZgQflRkCYTOP46wG8Fo386jTdj1WfpD2E2rA4Gbv5fTDspAH8FOb7YHFATLjzPYB-Z"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ciaxGultQyxMJGgmVihNVWLoDK97lB_h66X0lWmmRDYYVmcPmTWbRf1Pdd5sbaqTIijq"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zyr-nuIZfgmhU6IMwBOl_Y4MPqXinsxq2Xn3kKKJtORgU72OK9sx_bIbn8nP11nZtrM2"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aXAZ-Vix-7SDZdTNwW7Ax1_dH6B_dnVo16vgccpwG8Z0EokT0awDR3fg99ouNIZJa88""]",,,,"PEGI 16",,false,"May 26, 2020",1710541054000,"3.1.0","Nová verze, která je plná vylepšení.<br>Zapracovali jsme třeba na cenovkách, aby pro vás orientace v nich byla co nejsnazší.

I've brought many items from them, and I've never been disappointed yet. Previously, their shipping was slow. However, they have improved a lot and are now delivering within 5 to 7 days.

Then, today, on the 13th, they mentioned delivery done, and i didn't receive anything , and I'm trying to contact them, but it's very hard to reach customer service, horrible experience i will never order from them again. Until now, i haven't received my items ,and i don't know what to do."",""It's not usable.. I can not search products and find more about them, because at every opening of product page it would display me a popup with promotions. Every product. Every time...all the time... I tried anything i could think about it to make it disappear.. So, I can not use the app, due to that extremely annoying popup with promotions."",""Very horrible. Got some items and returned, their policy says easy returned but aramex never comes to collect the goods, I had to take it to aramex but still after a month I have not received any confirmation of receipt. I contact customer care, and the application keeps on showing an error when trying to share the collection request. Please fix that issue."",""I used it once from Saudi, here is my feedback: Variety wise: the app is so good as it combines alot of different brands that can definitely do shopping easily and avoid those brands under boycotting. User Experience wise: it's also friendly Logistics and delivery: I believe this is the pain point, I guess the reason is because all orders are dispatched from Turkey.

Każde wyszukiwanie jest pełne promowanymi/sponsorowanymi ofertami - wyszukiwanie jest bezużyteczne. Czasem ""przescrolluję"" do zwykłych ofert, ale jeśli podgrupa ma tysiące produktów, jest to awykonalne. Jeśli Allegro chce utrzymać swój model monetyzacji z promowania ofert, to w jakimś stopniu powinna dać opcję do odfiltrowania sponsoringu.

In the app itself, I was told that first I need to pay more to get that discount. | Too often things arrive late, damaged, or not as described, its difficult to pick what to buy as a lot of junk and fake items is also being sold, the quality of goods on Allegro can never compare to what Amazon has to offer.Its a cheap Czech wannabe Amazon as everything in this country its lame | Brak ""Allegro lokalnie"", gdy zmieniam język z polskiego na np angielski.

Przecież można sprzedawać lokalnie w innym języku, niż Polski. | Gdy klikam w wyświetlany produkt, który mnie interesuje, przekierowuje mnie do innych promowanych droższych produktów, o innych parametrach. Mało przejrzyste przeglądanie w porównaniu z podobnymi platformami w innych krajach. | Próbowałem negatywnie ocenić sprzedającego, to allegro najpierw rzucało błędami, a potem uwaga uwaga ukryło opcje oceny tego sprzedawcy i tego produktu, gdzie przy wszystkich innych produktach dalej one wiszą. Jest to karygodna nieuczciwość, życzę wam wszystkiego najgorszego | Przy zmianie miejsca dostawy i wybraniu z mapy punktu odbioru, aplikacja zawiesza się.

Skończyły się czasy monopolu na polskim rynku. Macie teraz konkurencję, która ma lepszą ofertę niż wy. | Obecnie największą bolączką aplikacji jest brak podtrzymywania ""sesji"" przeglądania. Obecnie macie czasami po setki tysięcy przedmiotów w jednej kategorii. Zdarza mi się nagminnie zadawanie po kilkanaście filtrów żeby przeglądać to co mnie interesuje, niestety wtedy w trakcie przyglądania wystarczy przypadkiem cofnąć jeden raz za dużo, i cała przeglądana lista wraz z ustawionymi filtrami przepada na zawsze. Odechciewa się wtedu w ogóle używać wersji z Androida.

Dziś pobiliscie rekord zawracania gitary: ""niedziela handlowa: na allegro kupisz w niedzielę."" - no dzięki za info, totalnie potrzebne mi bylo żeby zakłócić spokój w niedzielne popołudnie i wezwać mnie do telefonu. Edit; na odpowiedź: nie da sie wylaczyc dlatego 1* | Nie mogę zmienić sposobu dostawy, aplikacja się zawiesza. Edit: mam ponad 10gb wolnego miejsca, tylko aplikacja allegro otwarta, internet raczej stabilny. Tylko przy tej jednej czynności się wiesza | Good app | Application is confusing. It is hard to find specific products. I wanted to evaluate my previous purchase, but there was a problem with the expired token. | To jakaś masakra od miesiąca nie idze dokończyć zakupów w aplikacji. Jak chce zapłacić BLIK to po powrocie do aplikacji z kodem wisi jak trup.... Masakra. | good | Powiedzcie proszę UI-jowcam że ta ostatnia zmiana ze zwijano-rozwijanym headerem jest do dupy. Dlatego że kontent który ciągnę do gory musi zostawać pod palcem. Niech ten header zwija się, ale kontent musi zostać pod palcem. Zerknijcie jak to jest zrobione z address line'em w mobilnym chromie. Upd: sory, nie podałem wersji klienta - Android 8.53.1 | Kiedys byla dobra.. a od konca 2023 coraz gorzej.. appka nie dla klkenta a dla sprzedawcy głównie droppshipingowego... wciskać jak najwiecej bylejakich produktow. 2 a nie 1 bo jednak cos tam mozna znalezc w gąszczu śmieci.. brak filtrowania na ""niechińskie produkty"" | Ogolnie lubie te aplikacje ale zgodzę sie z innymi opiniami ze przydalo by sie dodac kilka opcji jak chocby te WYSZUKIWANIE KILKU czy przeglad alternatywnych WARIANTÓW w formie listy, opisu etc. Aktualnie trzeba kaze kliknac i nie wiadomo jaki to wariant. Dodatkowo od pewnego czasu podczas wyboru innego paczkomatu czy sposobu dostawy (po wskazaniu paczkomatu i kliknieciu ""wybierz"") aplikacja sie kazdorazowo zawiesza. Dziala ta opcja tylko na wersji z przegladarki. Aktualizacje nie pomagają. | Kvůli mojí recenzi na falešný produkt na Heurece mi volali 3x a jednou napsali mail abych jim vysvětlil proč je falešný, i když na jejich webu to psalo přes 20 poláků.. Následně už ani neodpověděli. Nedoporučuji předávat kontaktní informace. | Działa źle, jak stolec (cenzura google) przy wyborze allegroboxa lub innego punktu (czytaj zmiany adresu punktu) aplikacja się zawiesza więc nic się nie da kupić . Reinstalacja , wyczyszczenie danych apki nic nie daje . | Good | Ciągle występujące lagi utrudniają korzystanie z aplikacji. Po wyjściu z aplikacji allegro, aby skopiować numer blik nie mogę go wpisać w rubrykę. Po tym jak opuścimy aplikację należy ją włączyć od początku, aby z niej można było normalne korzystać, co niestety uniemożliwia mi dokonanie płatności. Bardzo proszę to naprawić. | Brak możliwości filtrowania produktów wg kraju wysyłki, a jest to często kluczowe w kontekście cła, kosztów i czasu dostawy. | Aplikacja myśli, że jestem botem i blokuje mi możliwość logowania, nie pokazuje też moich zakupów. Wyświetla się tylko: ""Ups! Nie udalo sie wyswietlic moje zakupy"" | saldo bieżące dobrze. A gdzie numer do wpłat... Dziękuje za radę. Opinii nie zmieniam. | Recently I've had a really bad experience with Allegro as one of the products I bought turned out to be unoriginal and of very poor quality. Customer Service Representatives very extremely unwilling to resend an email with a link to change the product opinion. P.S. Developer of the app responded to me that 90-day is the time frame to post and/or edit the product opinion as per Allegro rules. Unfortunately that is a lie as I just changed the product opinion today reaching out for help to google | Good app and fast delivery, but I can only view the app in Czech. Can't copy/paste to use translate tools. Once installed, can't view items on Web (with built in translators) due to automatic app redirect to the app. Would give 5 stars if had an English option / other languages available but for now I need to use 2 devices Thank you for your response- for allegro czech rep, language cannot be changed following your instructions unfortunately... | Aplikacja niestabilna, crashuje. | 1 cenzura : książkę akwarelisty z austrii kupisz, a 🧯szczyść borze nie kupisz. służba czuwa. 2. jak ktoś ma konto 20 lat to mu nie wyświetla materiałów dla dorosłych, bo może być niepełnoletni. 3. nękają wiadomościami, 4. sprzedawców traktują jak dłużników 5. kody, opisy, zdjęcia, a jak chcesz kupić spodnie, to w wyszukiwarce nie wyszukasz po długości 🤗 6. pralnia. wystarczy sprawdzić ilość książek w cenie >1500 zł. skoro nikt normalny tego nie kupuje, to jaki jest powód tych ogłoszeń? | Niestety portal promuje i ochrania cwanych sprzedawców...nie polecam staniwczo.Pomimo waszych zapewnień i negatywnych opinii i tak nie bronicie klienta. | edit: the update fixed the issue Installed on my samsung a54 and it's full of bugs, I can't login, I can't contact support or do anything | There are a lot of scammers in this application. | Generalnie cały serwis jest ok, ale to że trzeba płacić za dostawę poniżej 45 zł jest mega irytujące. Jakoś Amazon znalazł rozwiązanie, że płaci się prime za rok i każda dostawa jest wliczona. Kupiłam właśnie 3 produkty z allegro i wszystkim brakuje kilka złotych do 45 i tak naprawdę zakupy są droższe o 30 zł bo ttlke kosztuje przesyłka do każdego z osobna do tego, co za bzdura. Stanowczo coś powinno być z tym zrobione. | Niemal dobry serwis gdyby nie przekierowania i beznadziejne tlumaczenia opisow zagranicznych by 5 gwiazdek | Does not work in the DeX mode. In the browser I cannot use discount voucher (which is limited to the app). | Dużo podchwytliwych powoadomień które na dłuszą metę denerwują. Apka sama w sobie daje sobie radę ale brak mi wiele funkcji jak np udostępnij w allegro lokalnie.... | Today, allegro give me great support to solve my issue. Thank you very much Allegro team, the seller insulting me on the Allegro discussion chat, please kindly take action on him | Niesamowice, nie utczciwe , przyznajace sprzedawcom, ktorzy klamia racje, na temat reklamacji, juz nigdy z tak nieuczciwej firmy nice nie kupie. | always find what I want i trust the sellers | Syf i pół metra mułu, a one box to już padaka na całego nie zamawiajacie do boxa. Stałem 10min przy boxie i dostałem informację że w między czasie paczka została odesłana jak? Przez tunel podziemny. | Dodajcie w ustawieniach możliwość wyłączenia WSZYSTKICH towarów z Chin. Jeżeli w wyszukiwarce można to zrobić przy użyciu filtrów, to w rekomendacjach ciągle pojawiają się jakieś śmieci z Chin. Ludzie korzystają z Allegro do szybkich zakupów na jutro-pojutrze i nie chcą widzieć towarów z Chin w rekomendacjach! | Nie da się zalogować, tylko na Android. Nie dochodzi sms przy logowaniu numerem telefonu | very efficient and well designed app, I use it quite often | 1. Dodajcie wyszukiwanie do wiadomości. Na www jest. 2. Nie da się uregulować rozliczenia z Allegro z poziomu apk. 3. Nie da się wypłacić pieniędzy z poziomu apk. A na www trzeba tą opcję znaleźć przez Google. 4. Ani w apk ani na www nie da się automatycznie od wypłaty odjąć kwoty, która regulowałby rozliczenie z Allegro za sprzedaż. | Od kilku miesięcy więcej nie działa aplikacja, jak działa. Nawet po usunięciu i ponownemu ściągnięciu nic się nie zmieniło. Nawet nie można sprawdzić zakupów zaraz po zaplaceniu, często nawet przestaje działać podczas dokonywania płatności! | Nowa aktualizacja aplikacji ją zniszczyła. Nie wiadomo co gdzie jest w zamówieniu. | Aplikacja super, ale bot robi psikusy i już mnie wkurza. Piszę do sprzedających info, że zwrócili tylko część pieniędzy za zwrócony towar, opuszczam czat i myślę, że wszystko załatwione. Sprzedający nie odpisuje przez tydzień więc chcę się przypomnieć, a okazuje się, że czatbot mi zablokował wiadomość, a ja tego nie zauważyłem... Słabo zadesignowany feature wg mnie. Edit: najpierw oduczcie ją blokować wiadomosci, bo to mocno utrudnia komunikację i frustruje :p | super | ***PLEASE FIX THIS BUG*** while writing a review in English, it prohibits certain words that are contained within an English word. For example I bought some jars and said ""these are sturdy jars"" and I couldn't post it because the word sturdy has the prohibited word ""turd"" in them....this makes writing a review in English almost IMPOSSIBLE. It wouldn't let me write the word associated either and hundreds of other English words. Whoever implemented this needs to be fired for incompetence. | Od lat zawsze zamawiam do jednego paczkomatu, a i tak co któreś zamówienie muszę wyszukiwać go od nowa. Aplikacja notorycznie zmienia mi go przy zamawianiu na inny paczkomat nie wiadomo czemu. | The best app for shopping lovers<3 professional, quick and accurate service | English please | the best e-commerce app and e-commerce store | 👍 | good | Brak przycisku share przy ofertach allegro lokalnie. | Jak zablokowac oferty z CHIN ???? Chyba doczekalismy sie konca Allegro a wydawalo sie niemozliwe. Co za smietnik ! | Ta vec vubec nedokaze vyhledavat v cestine, prijde mi to jak vyhledavace pred googlem v roce 97, hlavne ze mi to uvedenou vec nabizi v reklame v aplikaci spravne, na ten samy dotaz ve vyhledavani to nachazi nerelevantni nesmysly. Opravdu je lepsi pouzivat polskou verzi a translatorem si to prelozit do polstiny. | Durna akcja z shakerem, powinno być ograniczenie jedna okazja na cały event dla jednego użytkownika. Boty skupują 2000 produktów w 2 sekundy. Słabe. | The app refuses to send confirmation codes to my email, and sends confirmation codes by SMS which never arrive!!! I'm going to try the web version. SORT THIS OUT AS SOON SS POSSIBLE!! Then, I'll upgrade my rating. PS Now, it won't even let me SIGN IN without a confirmation code - which I of course haven't received!! | Szukanie jakiejkolwiek konkretnej oferty jest wysoce frustrujące. Komunikat ""Coś poszło nie tak"" pojawia się bez przerwy. Te same oferty wyskakują po kilkadziesiąt albo i kilkaset razy, a więc skrolowanie jest czynnością pozbawioną często sensu. Co gorsza, jest już na ten temat mnóstwo opinii, do których Allegro dopisało zdawkowe odpowiedzi i nic się nie poprawia. Szkoda. | ile tych powiadomień chcecie wysyłać? parę razy dziennie dostaje notyfikację ""jakie to super okazje macie"". edit, odpowiedź na odpowiedź: tak udało mi się znaleźć w androidzie opcje uciszenia was. uff jaka ulga. | I tried to purchase using 3 different credit cards and transactions failed every single times. I use this cards everywhere around the word with no problems (visa & MasterCard, Amex not accepted) | Please, make english language option, I can't find it | I paid for sth. And product is even sent to me for a month. If I cancel the purchase, they ask the product. Product isn't even shipped. How can I send back? :) I cannot get my money back. It's some kind of Ponzi scheme. I will not change this comment until I get my money back. | Allegro Pay dostępne tylko dla obywateli Polski... dyskryminacja | they dont have good menu. Sellers take advantage of this bad app and use it on you. They put fake ads never send the product to you and you have nothing to do. noone cares. sellers know these things and they scam you. never use it i will uninstall it now as well. | Pokazywanie ficzerów przy każdym starcie aplikacji irytuje. | Po ostatniej aktualizacji kiepsko. | Horrible app, the DPD services they use are horrible and have poor delivery services. They lie about having arrived at your location | 1 STAR NOT FOR APP BUT FOR UNRELIABLE POLISH RETAILERS. NO REPLIES TO EMAILS , VERY SLOW SHIPPING ETC. | Autorzy aplikacji bez wątpienia znają dużo języków ale między sobą posługują się wyłącznie baranim językiem. Bo inaczej się nie da wytłumaczyć taki niski poziom polskich aplikacji allegro i olx. Porażka polskiego IT. | Do you think it would be too difficult to start using english in your international shop? | Neustále opravuje správná slova s dojmem, že se jedná o chyby. Například PSP baterie opraví na PSA baterie. Děkuji za mega rychlou odpověď, upravuji hodnocení na 5 hvězd | Brak możliwości podania peselu przy zaznaczeniu faktury VAT przy zakupie od firmy (na stronie po prostu podaje się go w polu nip, tu - ograniczenie ilości znaków nie pozwala na to) | Aplikace se pouze proxy na Aliexpress | Brakuje mi w aplikacji ustawienia domyślnej metody płatności oraz w wypadku nie ustawienia takiej metody zapamiętanie ostatnio używanej | Nie da się ocenić produktów w dowolnej kolejności, tylko aplikacja narzuca ich listę, a poza tym czas na ocenę produktu i transakcji jest zdecydowanie za krótki. Gwarancja trwa 2 lata, a produkt można ocenić tylko przez 90 dni? Jakiś żart, bo często uczciwa, wartościową ocena możliwa jest dopiero po dłuższym okresie użytkowania danego produktu. Podobnie z oceną sprzedawcy, szczególnie gdy wystąpią problemy z procesem reklamacji. Allegro lokalnie to jakaś parodia - raj dla oszustów. | Opłata za sprzedaż jest zbyt duża, nie można odkryć ukrytych zakupów a często o to ludzie się pytają, też nadal nie można nadawać bez etykiety innym słowem olx lepsze. | Slow app, tends to crash all the time, bad UI. Tragic | Strasza firma, straszne zasady, olbrzymi wyzysk. | Za często pyta o zgody (szczególny przypadek jeśli się odmówi, przejdzie do innego menu i wróci na stronę główną ponownie pyta nawet podczas tego samego uruchomienia aplikacji), nie chce zapamiętać odpowiedzi ""nie"". Tona promowanych niezgodnych z wyszukiwaniem elementów. Nie ma co naciskać na profilowanie. Albo się daje możliwość nie zgodzenia się i się ją respektuje, ale się o zgody nie pyta. | Nie mogę odzyskać hasła w aplikacji bo przerzuca mnie do ""Odkrywaj korzyści"" i przestają wyświetlać się pola w które mogę coś wpisać | Ta aplikacja powinna pewnie mieć mniej niż 5 gwiazdek bo pewnie czegoś tam jej brakuje ale daję 5 bo od lat skutecznie korzystam z niej jako kupujący na większą skalę i całościowo względem wielkich konkurencyjnych globalnych graczy apka jak i cały portal są znacznie lepsze. | Very useful marketing place. Recommended | Apka dalej laguje przy scrolowaniu ale przycięte wyniki wyszukiwania zostały już naprawione, dzięki! | Easy to use. More English translation needed | Ciągłe błędy w aplikacji. Często nie działa żadna z zakładek. Edit: aktualizacja nie pomogła | Jako český zákazník Allegro.cz je fakt super, že aplikace umí jen polsky, gratuluju 😂😂😂 UPDATE: oni mi tu i odpověděli polsky 😂 Zkrátka bez znalosti tohoto světového jazyka si Allegro.cz neužijete... Appka se dá do češtiny přepnout samozřejmě, ale to nastavení je hluboko v polském menu a to až poté, co se úspěšně přihlásíte ke svému účtu... | 😵‍💫😁😁 | good quality | Aplikacja przestała otwierać Allegro box zdalnie, nie działa również pokazywanie QR kodu. Można tylko wpisywać cyferki ręcznie. Kaszana. Aplikację odinstalowałem i zainstalowałem ponownie najnowszą wersję z Google Play i to nic nie pomaga. Deweloper twierdzi, że jest jakiś formularz kontaktowy, gdzie mogę zgłosić problem. Ten formularz jest tak ukryty, że go nie mogę znaleźć. Allegro zdecydowanie nie chce, żeby do nich pisać. | Dlaczego ta aplikacja ciągle się wiesza i wysypuje? | Irytujące powiadomienia o promocjach, koszyku, których nie można wyłączyć | The product range is large and the prices are cheap. This is a good. Cons: There is not English interface in the app for Czechia. And the option of delivery to the sale points and boxes is not available in many products. | not the best but great | It does not seem to have the translation option embedded, which makes it unusable by English speaking consumers. | I had horrible experience with this allegro.people, don't believe them they are thieves. They took money for parcel and didn't bring | Thieves they took money and didn't bring our paracel thieves robbers | problemy występujące w poprzednich wersjach naprawione, mogę bez przeszkód robić zakupy w aplikacji. | Wszystko fajnie, ale gdyby tylko ta Alina nie blokowała wysyłania każdej wiadomości do sprzedawcy podpowiadając coś bez sensu. Do tego klikając nazwę produktu, po otwarciu jego oferty, niejednokrotnie okazuje się, że jego nazwa zmieniła się na inną. Brawo. No i opcja ""Połącz te same oferty"" ukryła mi najtańszą opcję. Trzeba uważać. | App | Mam subskrypcję Allegro Start na 1 rok, którą zakupiłem. Z jakiego prawa anulowaliście ją najpierw u członka Smart Family, a teraz także u mnie? Wcześniej kontaktowałem/am się z obsługą w tej sprawie, a także członek mojej Smart Family, ale nie otrzymałem/am żadnej odpowiedzi od was! Oszukujecie waszych klientów! To skandal! | Skopiowalem opis aukcji i wyszukalem - aukcja nie zostala znaleziona. Porazka... I jeszcze co chwila zapytania czy jestes zadowolony z wyszukiwania... Trzeba szukac i kupowac przez google'a albo w amazonie | UX disaster - finding basic options is a nightmare. I'm able to create the offer but it's impossible to find it then in my account. The icon ""sell something"" means nothing - I found it by accident while clicking everything on the screen .... | Nie ma opcji kontaktu z serwisem. | Ups, nie udialo sie wyswietlic Moje zakuoy... Aplikácia jest aktuakizovana... | Thx for google login, but english language ia also essential | Стало удобнее, все открывается быстрее | ALLEGRO.... Dlaczego nie zrobicie jak eBay dla wszystkich sprzedajacych z poza granic Polski, najpierw zakupiony produkt jest dostarczony do kupującego i dwa dni po dostawie dostają kase a zwłaszcza dla Chińczyków którzy zgarniają kasę i znikają likwidując konto i otwierają nowe pod inną nazwą ...ani kasy ani zakupionych produktów !!!! ... ALLEGRO WARTE PRZEMYSLENIA !!!!! | W niektorych wyszukaniach wyswietlaja sie tylko ""promowane"" produkty i nie mozliwe jest skrolowanie aby je pominac bo to zajmie wieki a i aplikacja lubi sobie stanac podczas sktolowania. Fajny feature sprzedajacy placa bo inaczej juz produkt bedzie wykluczony tyle tego jest.. To ma pomoc uzytkownikowi??? Dziadostwo!! | No więc, zainstalowałem apke. Gdzie moje 10 monet? | наверное неплохо | You can't not love this guys (As long as they don't change their policy) | Wyszukiwanie za pomocą foto jest absurdalne. Z aplikacji nie mogę zapisać obrazu z zakończonej (lub trwającej) oferty. Nie otwiera się ""załaduj plik"" aby poszukać podobnego przedmiotu, wystawionego przez innego sprzedawcę. Otwiera się kamera foto. Co ja mam sfotografować, kiedy ja szukam przedmiotu, a jeśli szukam, to znaczy że go nie posiadam. | Zdaję sobie sprawę że nie jest to bezpośrednia ocena samej aplikacji, ale - kurcze chciałam kupić jedną małą rzecz, poszukiwanie jej zajęło mi bite pół godziny. Nie dlatego, że nie mogłam jej wyszukac czy kategorie były źle opisane. Dlatego że platforma dosłownie wpychała mi aukcje ewidentnie chińskie, z wysyłką za 30 dni. Kuchnia felek no, gdybym chciała kupić coś z Chin, weszlabym na Aliexpress. Fajnie byłoby, gdyby jednak za platformą stała jakość, nie ilość. | Can you buy doge | I ordered shoes 10 days ago and still i have not received ,opened discussion but now the seller and allegro represantation has gone quiet | Very nice app | Ciągłe problemy z wyszukiwaniem: wyświetla tylko część wyników, gubi filtry itd. Edit: a najgorsze że nie ma przycisku do odświeżenia :( | Zrobili z tego śmietnik taki sam jak OLX wpisuje blender a pokazuja mi sie akcesoria, zaczym znajde blender musze przewinac 1500 pozycji. Dziekuje kupilem w normalnym sklepie stacjonarnym | Всё супер, скинул, звезду за отсутствие языка. | No i dostało się chciwemu Allegro. Korzystajcie z eBay policy a ostatnie doniesienia w mediach będą dla Was bardziej przyjazne | The app doesnt work correctly after the update | Keep crashing, keep logging me out and not letting me log in ""coś poszło nie tak, sprobuj ponownie za chwile"" Good idea for fast online shopping, if only it worked.. | bardzo źle to aplikacje kupiłem 3 przedmioty proszę o zwrot pieniędzy, ponieważ pomyliłem się przy ostatnim zamówieniu, nie dali mi zwrotu pieniędzy byłem zaskoczony po dwóch dniach otworzyłem konto nie logowałem się tak źle te aplikacje sprzedawcy to oszuści, którzy nie zwracają mi pieniędzy, a zarządzanie aplikacjami usunęli mnie, więc nie mogłem otworzyć mojego starego konta, a co z moim zwrotem pieniędzy, kupione bardzo źle, proszę, nie ufajcie tym aplikacjom | Allegro Smart Family nie daje możliwości darmowej dostawy dla członków rodziny | I really dont like to get a notification of an item i lookes at just once out of curiosity. I am being invited to take a look at the same thing daily! Not cool | Dobra apka, brakuje mi jednak możliwości otwierania kilku szczegółów na raz, podobnie jak to możemy zrobić w apce dokumentów Google. Dodatkowo też trochę się Wam rozjechał layout one boxa przy odbiorze - środkowa kolumna jest za nisko ;) | I loved the application but it's missing small improvements related to the auction page to give better user experience. It should show users how much they bid compared to the current Bidding and also the left Bidding time | Stona pisze ""Pobierz aplikację mobilną Allegro i zgarnij do 10 Monet na swoje zakupy."". Więc zrobiłem to, a nie ma 10 monet. Nadal 0 monet. O co chodzi? | Spoko apka ale przydałoby się zaimplementowanie kategorii powiadomień (a nie tylko jedna kategoria na wszystko). Jak zbliża się płatność AllegroPay to dostaje SMS, mail I powiadomienie z apki, mega redundancja więc chciałbym chociaż jedną z tych rzeczy zredukować 🙈 | Ta apka to jest po prostu dramat. Znaleźć coś w natłoku reklam graniczy z cudem. Wręcz nienawidzę jej używać i odpalam tylko w ostateczności, się zawsze wiem że muszę się wtedy nastawić na frustrację i stratę czasu. Wszystko oczojebne jak jednorożec srający tęczą a najpotrzebniejsze rzeczy poukrywane. Filtry się kasują bo allegro nie chce żebyś szukał tak jak Ci wygodnie tylko tak jak oni chcą. Za tę apkę autorzy powinni zapier$#@ na galerze po wsze czasy. | Cant sign in with Google, unexpected error http 403 | Po update zepsuła się wyszukiwarka- przy zaznaczonej opcji ""połącz te same oferty"" nie jestem w stanie otworzyć takich wyników wyszukiwania, klik nie działa. | Ok | gud app | Last update broke the app's sorting. Now if you sort by popularity, the UI stops responding to touches - the touch animation displays, but buttons/cards don't respond. Only way is to use default sorting by relevance. | Jest jakiś problem z aplikacją. Po sortowaniu, nie można otworzyć oferty. Proszę o sprawdzenie | A teraz nie da się otwierać wyników wyszukiwania z filtrem - po kliknięciu oferty dosłownie nic się nie dzieje, poza podświetleniem jej na ułamek sekundy. To samo przy próbie dodania jej spod tej listy do ulubionych. Albo klikasz na zakończoną ofertę w koszyku i dostajesz błąd o jej braku. No i breadcrump zepsuty, bo nawigacja wstecz wyświetla losowe rzeczy. Nie rozumiem jakim cudem tak zabugowana aplikacja może mieć średnią 4.7. Nowe jak zwykle wrogiem dobrego. | W ostatnim tygodniu pojawiło się dużo problemów związanych z funkcjonalnością. Na każdej platformie . | Spróbujcie coś zwrócić w tej aplikacji lub skontaktować się z Allegro. Porażka | Absolutely rubbish 0 points to compare to Amazon or eBay unable to log in to old account, but you can do new account on same email you need only email and phone number to verify nothing else poor security...what the heck. | Przydałaby się mozliwosc filtrowania wyników wyszukiwania po średniej ocen i najlepiej po ilości ocen. Jest bug w procesie zakupowym. Jesli mamy apkę w dark mode, wybieramy w koszyku platnosc kartą Visa ktora przekierowuje nas do okna w light mode i po powrocie aplikacja już jest cała w light mode a nie dark mode. | Not taking German phone number, therefore can't purchase. Help center not helpful | Super place to buy your products, and it delivers 🙌 👏 👌 👍 | Durna apka. Po zakończeniu aukcji nie można sprawdzić kto licytował czy wygrał. Nie można wejść do centrum wiadomości. Wiadomości pisane są od małej litery. Nie można skopiować nawet słowa z aukcji. Wyszukiwarka to dno. Nie można szukać w zasięgu. Tylko miasto lub województwo. | To jest skandal, że aplikacja przestaje działać (np wywala płatności) podczas korzystania z vpn | Uważajcie, wsparcie pozakupowe ogranicza się jedynie pospieszania stron do ugody. Kupiłem używany sprzęt z wadami, o których sprzedający nie wspomniał. Allegro nie zobowiązuje sprzedawcy do zwrotu pieniędzy. POK jest bezużyteczny. 2023: Allegro likwiduje czat z konsultantem. Mam do północy czas na domówienie szczegółów, nie mam możliwości konsultacji. | Wyszukiwarka pokazuje teraz opłacone przez sprzedawców reklamy zamiast produktów zgodnych z wybranymi kryteriami wyszukiwania. Czy wasz nowy model biznesowy polega na utrudnianiu robienia zakupów? Przypominam pierwszą zasadę marketingu: Nie zrażać do siebie obecnych klientów. | Ogólnie dobrze ale brakuje możliwości zakupu wybranych produktów z koszyka 
(tylko cały koszyk). Również obsługa czasem jest taka sobie (głównie przy 
ustawianiu kategorii i filtrów). Ogólnie użyteczna apka | Searching through too many products is painful. In the Android app, I do not see full text (size of clothes) of the product description for the search results. To see the full text, I actually have to open and enter the product. I very much want to filter out from my search results the shops that I don't want to buy from. Still not enough search and filter (out) options or the filters aren't working that good in the Android app. People shop on their phones and thanks for improving the app. | Perfect | Apka działa w sumie ok, dobrze się wszystko synchronizuje z kompem, ALE: - jak rozciągnąć listę aukcji na 100% szerokości i od czego to zależy? Mam kilka telefonów i niektóre mają na całą szerokość a inne ok 80%. Brakuje też desktopowej opcji ""znajdź wiele"" - a to istotne... | Auctions unusable, bots outbid you instantly. Edit: I'm dumb, but they need better job to clarify how auctions work in app. Web version explains everything instantly. | super aplikacje , dobrze skategoryzowane,, różne systemy wysylek i zwrotów oraz platnosci czyni ta aplikacje bardzo praktyczną | Bad update | Лучшая в Польше платформа для заказа товаров. Крутая поддержка покупателей. С удовольствием пользуюсь уже несколько лет. | Best shopping app | Logowanie przez allegro nie dziala tak samo jak przez google czy fb. Żadna z podanych obcji. | Chce do jasnej cholery odstąpić od umowy. Dlaczego nie mogę tego zrobić? Próbuję wysłać wniosek ale nic się nie dzieje. | 👌👍 | Aplikacja co chwile sie zacina. Zdjecia laduja soe z duzym opóźnieniem | It used ro be a great app, as there used to be a button on the home screen to change the language and currency, but now it is gone. So where can you change the language to english? I do not speak polish, so please answer in english. | Ciagły spam bezużytecznych powiadomień. Edit: Chcę otrzymywać od was powiadomienia, w tym te marketingowe, nie chcę otrzymywać kilka razy dziennie rzeczy w stylu ""Zagadka, dwie kulki i... WĄŻ PRYSZNICOWY SREBRNY 150CM SZYBKA DOSTAWA"" Czy z analityki naprawdę wychodzi, że to ma sensowny CTR? | Easy, liable and fast | Nie działa, na peierwszym ekranie pyta o kraj j walute i nie przechodzi dalej.

"Threads, an Instagram app","Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Open social networking – coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

They are posting in every language so it's difficult to take screen shot of all the post and comments then translate. I want translation option back."",""Used to work. Now it doesn't. I got a new phone. Installed all the same software. Logged into all the same accounts. Now when I open Threads, it asked if I want to log in with my Instagram account. I confirm it.

Not possible to sort locations, left menu opens instead. | Clear information easy to understand at a glance. | Aung Thu ya | Very good | Excellente | 👌 | At my location the app on my home screen says 6 degrees but when I tap the app it says 10 degrees. | Accurate weather forecast | Great | Usually spot on | Very poor | The best by far👌 | keeps you in form when a storm is coming in | Good app | This gives you a better forecast then our local weather. | Nice smooth app with good forecasts but the hourly part 48 hours etc not to clear,hence 4* | no way to get rid of ads, goodbye | just downloaded this but i like it. | Wondering and Incredibly!!! | I like the app because it has a lot's of features | really good indication of the expected weather conditions | more details then the met office | 5 star when the winds speed is displayed on the radar screen. My favourite bit of an app, great for deciding if an hours bike ride is possible giving minute by minute rain info, and the wind speed is important because I'm in my seventies and being blown off a bike hurts. Wind speed still NOT clear. Where is it? Want a little arrow with mph and then I'll give five stars. Also the ""forecast"" part of the radar map moves much too quickly. | It's okay 👍 | seems to be accurate, and reliable👍👍👍👍👍😃 | this app is very precise I love it | doesn't matter how accurate this is if it has unskippable ads when you wanna check the weather | This application is very excellent and better, yours should use the services of weather and temperature of the region from this application | Great app! | excellent app | Brilliant | But can you get rid of ads Please 🇨🇦⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍 | Very good at getting an idea of what it could be like. | I've been using this app for a long time and am fully satisfied. It is extremely accurate with it's predictions, even showing the exact progression of cloud movements and amount of rain each hour. Highly recommended! | very detailed info. thx | It is stuck in an endless cycle asking to subscribe and pay and accept all cookies. Not good at all | Great | very few ads in a great radar | Worthles it's raining crazy and it shows 0 percipitatiom | adverts annoying but app good | It takes a degree in rocket science to figure it out! | Love the radar - so helpful for planning my dog walks etc | Way off on weather it said nothing about snow for today or the the next 16 days yet theres almost 3 inch ad it says it be raining in the next i highly doubt with how hard its snow which isnt light liks its claiming. | Well for one thing it's gonna rain tomorrow- and for my location it said it would be cloudy for 2-14-24 and I work outside I need an app that highly accurate, yours is not . Sorry that's the truth.🙁 | a good weather app and radar | good | Awful | Great updates. | Excellent and accurate predictions. | All the lastest weather from multiple cities I frequent. All in the palm of your hand 😊 | Great app, very accurate. | usually accurate | After 3 Days of your Weather App showing that it was Raining at our location when there was No Rain Falling or anywhere on the Radar, I have uninstalled the App and have Gone to another more Accurate Weather App. | i give it 5 star because it had what I was looking for but we still have more to came | I have had this app for nearly a year. I find it the most accurate to date from any other I have used.🙂 | Good clear weather forecast | Use it every day and its accurate | Just what I need a true upto the min update | best weather app around | First class A GREAT SITE WEATHER IS ALWAYS FIRST CLASS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. WORTH A LOT MORE STARS. THANK YOU AWAYS USE IT FOR MY WORK. STILL THE BEST WEATHER APP YOU CAN GET A BIG THANKS | Thank | great weather app. may be the best one yet. | Jutt | Love the radar view and the whole app in general. Highly recommend. | is very interesting it's make you to get lots of things | Use it everyday. Radar is a great feature. | Truthful | Uses wrong location for weather. When using location it keeps picking someplace other than my city, yet if I go to the satelight image, it shows my accurate location. | Good | Awesome App | Not accurate. Decent usability and function, but not accurate most days after 4 weeks of use. Terrible. | This is the best weather app I've found.....and it's free. | I like it | I tried to find Porto (Portugal) but it shows random places started with 'Porto' in just a few countries, no Portugal. Not to say how counter-intuitive it is where a country is mentioned in search results. And how the search field just disappears when you tap to correct your request. This UI sucks. Deleted the app after 10 mins. | Good bit sometimes a bit slow die to ads | It's got everything I want. Just wish there was a way to pay for getting rid of adds... | so I'm enjoying the weather app | Awesome.... I rarely like any app, lol ! This one I do.... Have a look please! | super | The best weather app I ever had. | I find the detail very easy to understand | Why isn't WICHITA'S NAME USED? | a great app for weather, clear and easy to use | brilliant app and keeps you updated daily | weather an the MONEY ❤️ | Easy to use and quite accurate too, makes such a difference 😆 | fantastic | Always seems to be the most accurate app for my location in Germany. Always used the Google weather app in the past, but that became wildly inaccurate at my location. I still have it installed and it seems to have improved again, but nowhere near as good as weather24. | Easy to use. | Very good. Accurate in my location despite it being very isolated. Radar function works great for my outdoor work. | App display is large and easy to understand. | love it. quite useful | Great app 👌 | Great colour editable widget and so far weather data been precise. Would like to see wind details in the widget in future update. | it's telling me weather before it happens. | Love you | brilliant ,and more or less correct all the time | Does what I want it to do! | just wish I could put it on my desk top for easiness otherwise ok. | Good idea, just not accurate at all. Between 3°-5° warmer than many other apps. | Confusing interface. There's a storm outside with 40mph winds and yet this app does not show any warnings, windspeed or any other relevant information | Excellent for any part of England or any part of the world. 99%accurate ,especially with the radar part of the app. | make it easier to get more days | accurate whether! | fairly accurate | I've just downloaded the application. I'm busy checking the accuracy of the physical quantities, particularly the temperature. The application already looks pretty amazing. | Previsioni del cavolo. Non ci prende manco di striscio | Best I have used so far | Perfect app for checking for rain! | Joke. That's all I can say . This app says 32 degrees you go outside look on the thermometer and it's 12. | Very good app to have on your phone check the weather at any given time and to see if its OK for you to go out without getting wet. | Pretty good and add locations to view an area that you may be travelling to in the near future. | tells you everything and many updates | LOVE THIS WEATHER APP! | Absolute garbage. Said snow at certain times, changed and changed....nothing...clear skies. Least accurate app for UK I've used. | radar is quite accurate | Good display | 👍👍👍👍 | Hate afs in my stuff | I really like the app but to get five stars, you need to have feels like temperature in the current section and in the hourly section. I see feels like on the daily outlook but it's equally if not more important to have on the current and hourly forecasts. | Excellent weather app. Used to use the Weather Channel but constant issues after an update led me to delete it. This app has no glitches, yet, and does everything that I need from a weather app. | Quite reliable? | Works perfectly | BRILLIANT FORECASTS!!!! | Very well deisgned widgets | does what it's supposed to do. | Money make money I choose don't come around conjure story best of Lucky | love it ! | seems to be very accurate | Works great. | really accurate forecasts | Have good day sunshine | Weather 8n Shreveport LA 71109 | Ok | accurate app | Seems to be accurate | feel good 👍 | very reliable | 👍👍👍👍 | detailed map and easy to follow | works well and accurate | easy to understand & currently less adds than others! | The app works great, however, the weather forecast doesn't follow the exact time zone of the city I chose, only local time is shown. | love | Great app. Accurate, understandable forecasts | Even with location enabled Radar just sits there turning endlessly and doesn't show anything. I have literally waited several minutes whilst the progress arrow circles endlessly. What more do you want to know? | the layout is easy to read and the info is colorful there are settings that can be set for other locations I really like it | amazing app | Simple, clear, accurate. What's not to like. | awesome job 👍 | Good as gold | 💜💜💜💜💜 | very good | So far... Seems like one of the better weather apps I've seen. | one of the best forcasting weather apps | The most accurate weather app I've had. I use it for dog walking, it tells me if it's showers or heavy rain, how strong the wind will be and what time it will start and finish. Excellent thank you | would recommend. great for keeping track of the weather ☁️. | Very handy app | I've only had this app for a short while and it's been invaluable with all the recent storms we've been having lm able to plan my days according","{""1"":6436,""2"":8086,""3"":17823,""4"":127071,""5"":731733}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 19.99 - CZK 169.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","wetter.com GmbH","wetter.com+GmbH","android@wetter.com","https://www.wetter.com","wetter.com GmbH

Repetition is good way to learn, but you can not learn anything new like this.. | Like a game, love it | This review is specifically due to the last update for the Japanese language course, the last update from 22/03 is horrible: 1) killed all the progress on key Kanji characters relevant for the Genki boom 1 (and, therefore for N5 JLPT), made the Kanji training idiotically simple and boring 2) killed thematic progress on more advanced topics revering to ""I'm German"" sentences or similar. 3) Mistakes and errors in translation, loss of progression feeling. Revert please. | not bad, am taking German and Japanese lessons right now and I haven't missed a day, so far only mild threats of kidnapping my family! | Great app, teaching pronunciation and vocabulary. I could use a little more grammar instruction. | Really good but if there were more language options i would of gaven this an 5 stars | Its the best app to learn any idiom, however it have 5 hearts and if u make a mistake u get 1 heart less and if u end up with 0 hearts u cant learn until u wait for the next day. | this is the best language learning app ever. It's super easy to learn when you add it as a widget! | to may adds but overall helpful | This is a awesome site to learn languages I have become fluent in English from my native language from this app | it's been a while since I started using Duolingo for Japanese lessons but I've never seen it like how garbage it is until now. it teaches words in hiragana, not kanji like it used to do | I love it it helps me how to learn Spanish Perfect for vacations like when you to speak Italian. | This is an amazing app to learn languages. It is so fun and exciting !!. | I'm leaning German its great.( so is duolingo).The only thing I wish is that every time I play I don't come to here.⭐⭐⭐⭐ | learning German is fun! | I'm pissed off I pay for something that doesn't fairly add up all the points I earn. I want a refund. | its good | it has really been helpful and easy to use | Really good way to learn a language! | Waste of time | it is amazing now I could talk to my Spanish friends | (please read to the end developers). This has to be the best language app. I've had a very good learning experience using this app. My favorite aspect is the friend quests, I'm always excited to complete them and they really help me progress. Although I wish a feature where we learners can chat with and practice using texts with those on our friend list could be added. Thanks for a great app.😊 | So far the experience is fun and motivating. I appreciate the accountability. My only concern and hope is that there are more opportunities to learn grammar and conjugations. | it's really good but if we could run out of a heart once every 2 wrong questions that would gain my confidence a bit more? im a big fan of duolingo, even though I started yesterday. I've been learning French in school for 3 years and I've learned more on Duolingo than school. | 5 stars! I learned some new Language! | i love it! i can now speak so many different languages! i highly recommend working with duo | just awesome period. | Happy to use the app. fun and learn languages | it is fun and their is barly any adds. and you can learn any language on the app. | great way to get started on a language. | Nice and slow and easy. wish I could redo the days training more than once in a day | I don't give reviews at all but Duolingo is so good I have to. It helps me and my little brother a lot with our Haitian Creole. I've heard of Duolingo a long time ago and I finally decided to try it. If you want to learn a language try Duolingo. it's fun and honestly it helps me a lot and I take notes to practice everyday. So thank you Duolingo for helping me and my brother with Haitian Creole. (duolingos TikTok comments ARE VERY funny) | he's a good app and I like him | lil bro needs to hush sometimes but he chill | the app is amazing, I just love ❤️ it | I like duolingo because its like a game so learn Russian its so easy | Add Urdu language too. I want Urdu to English translation. But they didn't add Urdu | I have got the paid subscription and so far so good. I wonder if we can have a chat feature where I can chat with my competitors. | ogenkidesuka. muy bueno. very nice. wahwa weewa. | Great | a good game to learn different languages in the world. cheak it out now | It doesn't really work but it's ok I tried to learn Spanish because I was going to Spain | I'm him | excellent | it's really helpful | so good like a game | easy understanding and learning | this is so educational!

Great app otherwise. | I'm learning Japanese and it's working I'm soooo happy:3!! | it's really amazing app👌👌👍👍👍english sikhne ke liye ye bahut accha platform h bs man lga kr sikhna hoga mast | Replaced staff with Ai and now it's more and more inaccurate | PLEASE GIVE MY FAMILY BACK | This has helped me learn French a lot! (Please give me my mom back duo) | After recent update, learning progress following in the app doesn't work well.. For example, on the first daily entry, I have to complete a lesson twice to be able to see the progress and continue with next lession. Please take a look on it and release a bug fix update! Details: App for android I'm learning Spanish language | really good app I learn so much Spanish here and at school also really funny especially the youtube channel | They're so amazing! (please free my dog.) | Jumping a level is a hassle as the app accepts only its translation to be correct (when multiple phrasing options are possible). | yass!! | great learned a lot | I love it | I needed more space to explain my situation and wasn't able to make my point with such few words it allows | Duolingo you made my mum angry because I told her that wasn't free so thanks a lot not | Castillion Spanish would be better for Europe learners | Learning new languages and practicing ones with which I am already familiar is easy and fun | very good | Easy and fun to use. I highly recommend Duolingo regardless of your current proficiency is in the language you are trying to learn. | such a good app for learning languages. even if you don't have premium, there are hardly any ads. I would highly recommend this if you are hoping to learn a language | very good for quick and fun learning | Duolingo, I have completed so many achievements so many times and yet I didn't get ANY gems for it. I have already lost 300 gems this way. So please, for the love of god fix this. | Amazing app for learning different languages, I can now speak lots of languages! Yay! | fun and good | Duolingo is great but I had a problem I was trying to get another language on but I was trying to switch and then I had to restart | It used to be better, but the app only teaches vocabulary, not grammar. This is the case even if you pay for super duolingo. There are better apps out there. | Great app | I LOVE IT | very helpful in learning a new language I like this app. Easy to use, | Duolingo, I like your app, I'm learning French, and I like it, you're app is amazing, I really like to learn a lot, but please, if you see this please put sign language to your app, I want to learn sign language, at least try to think about the people who cant communicate and hear, this can help them a lot and it can help us a lot. Thank you, duolingo. I'm gonna use this app every day. Have a nice day :) | Easy to use, and you pick the level of difficulty you want to start on, based on your level of experience in the language you anti to learn. | honestly, didn't expect the app to be so user friendly and was quite surprised to see how well operated the app is and how fun it makes learning a new language | This application helps me and my kid learn new languages for fun, traveling, and much more. To me, it’s a good application. | very easy and quick learning tool | it's good for beginner nice app | you learn a lot in this game | I like Duolingo because it's easy to use, convenient, and fun. | Really helpful, educative, fun & easy to use with the ""repeat make perfect"". It's a good app that i can proudly recommend for millions of people to use without regret. I love this app, kudos to the founder👍🌹 | they teach very well❤️ | After the last update it keeps getting stuck on the same level (example: I finish level 4/5, instead of advancing to 5/5 it makes me repeat level 4/5 multiple times...) | Easy way to learn a language 😀 | Too ads and expensive to an ""educational platform"" | Duolingo makes sure you understand, it gets you to read the words a lot so it's makes them more rememberable and it lets you fix your mistakes. It's good at reminding you to practice and it doesn't take long to do a lesson or multiple. | good | very interesting | Soo good I learned Italian | Very useful in learning new languages | AMAZING!!!! | I love dis sm | yeah | Very good app for learning, but I dont understand why Thai is not included, but Klingon? Come on! Get Thai on here. | helps me learn language | very important for learning language | it is Good | Excellent tool to learn a new language | Negative stars because I have lost a 56 day streak because of a bug that duolingo wont fix. I cant login because it was my highschool account, and on top of that it keeps throwing me out. Im so done with this app. | This App is just amazing, It would be Cool if they Add Amharic Language which has its Own Writing System and It has an ancient Counter part Language The Geez, if they include that as well it would be the World for me | truly helpful | cool app | 👍 | The best app for learning languages | More game than learning tool. Essentially a match game for language. I have a really good ear so I'm getting a lot of ""correct"" answers, but I don't feel like I'm learning a language. Some of the phrases are RIDICULOUS and would never be in any normal conversation. Most importantly there is NO conversation. It doesn't facilitate you actually SPEAKING the language. I don't find it helpful. Pimsleur is way better. | Lots Of Duolingo | Wonderful and systematic organized learning. | Super fun✨✨ | good app very harmful | Great way to practice daily. We are on our phones constantly so it's great to use phone time as Spanish practice time instead. | best language learning app | I love it so much the day since I started (which is today only) it's fun and it gets more challenging every time I love it so much I might spend my time on Duolingo than any other app | I'm leaning new things faster then ever | I'm still on it and it's pretty much helpful ☺️😁 | Duolingo is definitely a great way to learn a new language, but I do have one criticism to make. Duolingo helps me learn quick and easy, but when I get to a more competitive league, looking at the leader board makes me feel like I need to be 1st.

It can give a false sense of progression if you are only reusing the same words because you'll think you memorized it now but it was obvious: you'll forget it (or mix it up) at a later time). I wish it learned to move on and return older words if you forgot it much later like Anki. Also wish I could disable the voice over on pressed words in same language voice to text quizzes for harder exposure."",""Everything was fine until the app had an update two days ago. My previous lessons had been all but wiped clean, and then when I retook said lessons, I was given completely new terms, phrases, and sentences that I've never learned. It didn't even reset the lessons to the actual learning points. Basically said, \""Hey, we've updated your lessons, have fun learning!!\"" But all my data is gone!!!!"",""I like the gamification because I'm an extremely competitive person. I also like that you have to use problem-solving to figure out what certain words and phrases mean. I have a degree in teaching English to speakers of other languages, and my students always say that learning English through immersion is very similar to what Duolingo tries to emulate through the problem-solving component. That said, you aren't going to become \""fluent\"" using Duolingo. It's a good *supplement* for your study."",""I used to love Duolingo. I have a 1,383 day streak. I even got Super for two years because I genuinely felt like it was worth it. The big update was annoying at first and there's still some changes I really don't like, but some things felt more intuitive at the same time. I've stuck with it. However, upon learning that the company has laid off contract workers in favor of using AI to write lessons, I have canceled my Duolingo Super subscription and I will be looking for a new app to learn on.""]",false,false,false,"com.duolingo","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Also wish the shopping list icon was on the bottom instead if having to go on the 3 dots as I use that more than the partner offers. | Almost Every time i open app i need to log in, fix it. | Fantastic | The app malfunctions.

Lidl plus app opens on browser... very bad 😞 | Keeps sending meat vouchers when I selected vegetarian. Almost all of the vouchers are for high sugar content foods and bakery items | Love lidi | Doesn't work in Northern Ireland. | Lidl Display items shows discount price while billing its shows much higher price !!! | Începând cu luna martie, aplicația a început să meargă prost... La plățile mai mari, bonul apare mai târziu în aplicație. Uneori și după câteva zile. | not realy oriented towards loyal clients. Also, old school trick - get discount if (you purchase for certain amout) litery is getting on my nervs. Consider this - the info is, as always, hardly visible, and you don't notice it. As a client, you feel cheated. | Even though the app is in Dutch English and German the moment you choice country Portugal it forces you to use Portugese Language very backwards... | Too much useless notifications, too little functionality | Ever since I recieve d the message to upgrade the Lidl Plus app I have been unable to access the app. Each time I try to download I receive the message the it will be installed soon. After at least twenty attempts I despair! | The security attendant, Omar, was really helpful. It made shopping in Twickenham Lidl a very pleasant experience. | Pop ups are useless and annoying. The program often delays purchases because of sudden and slow upgrades. | What can I say I spent half my pension at most an d bur.arrad lidel shops I am an addiction to lidel | Easy to use. | This is a good application - if you don't mind the (sometimes) bad connectivity and problems at the checkout. In Sweden we still have those plexiglass shielding to protect the cashiers/employees. Don't get me wrong - it's a good thing they're there, because you never know when there's another pandemic... It's usually a pain in the **** to reach the QR-reader with your phone (because of the glass). But, if you're hunting for bargain prices I suppose that's the price you have to pay... 😉 | We love aldi for its quality goods especially there meat selection 😍 The beef & chicken has to be thee best around 😋 we shop in other stores like tesco and asda etc but always go to aldi for our meat . | Each time I try to run the app, I have to uninstall and reinstall it all over again and again.

You do have to wave your phone around in front of the sensor and get the beep to know it registered but you can do this almost any point even after the shop total comes up. Big negative is no way to add a shop reciept later if you forgot to use it or the system is down. Big plus is you get actual money off the shop after spend 200 in a month ie not just coupons. You do have to ""activate"" the coupons before use but generally they last a week befor expiring. | It looks good, pity we can't link accounts within a household. We both shop in Lidl, but rarely at the same time. Any chance of this becoming a feature? | Easy, accessible | I want to change the language without changing the country. Please fix it 🙏. | Always asks for update without access to Lidl card when you have to present it at the cashier | Excellent | Great shop .low prices | Η λίστα αγορών δεν είναι βολική, γιατί από τη στιγμή που θα αποθηκεύσω κάποιο προϊόν δεν μπορώ να δω ούτε από ποια ημερομηνία είναι διαθέσιμο ούτε την τελική του τιμή με την έκπτωση.

Less updates please | Good | Scam. The treats that are awarded from virtual scratch cards in app are always missing from the store | Won't allow signon in app. Just hangs. Waste of time, cannot shop in Lidl now, as I don't get the favourable offers. Tried uninstall/reinstall. Still hangs at signon. Store assistant suggested it was my phone. Samsung s23 ?? | Din pacate, in ultimul timp ii trebuie aplicatiei peste 1 minut sa se incarce..iar de multe ori nici nu reuseste incarcarea.. | Not very useful to find what you want compared to the old app | От две, горе долу ставащи приложения да направиш едно, с толкова садистичен UI и UX е колосално постижение. Първо не можеш да си отвориш картата за отстъпки по 15 секунди, заради някакви безумни реклами, и то докато чакаш на касата и губиш времето на персонала и хората на опашката. Второ менюто е като наръчник за атомна централа. Трето никакъв UX в секцията за избор от текущи промоции. Четвърто, никакъв ред и интуитивност. Пето, липсват интегрирани платежни методи. Шесто... няма място.... | Please add the favorites buttons with icons, prices etc as the lidl app. Shopping list is not usefull | Goodbye bugs? Hello improved performance?? An explanation would be nice as to precisely what's updated. This time I WAS in the queue when the app forced me to update but the assistant was able to use my phone number so I could receive my 30% discount on my sticky buns! At least let us choose to update at a later time! | Having to activate coupons feels like living in the stone age. I know you're a budget chain but come on... | No good for people who haven't got internet on their phone, I've been shopping in Lidl since the day it opened over 20yrs and don't get any coupons off vouchers not good enough for older people who do all their shopping in Lidl x | I'd like to make a few suggestions: 1. Activated coupons to automatically move up first so that the user can immediately see them and remember the products they activated without needing to scroll down. 2. Add a 'Feedback' section in the app. 3. Shopping list is not comparable to the 'Lidl' app that unfortunately is not used anymore. The current shopping list in 'Lidl plus' is not useful. | The best | Help ,but to long quickly, | I don't have enough memory left on my phone to update the Lidl app without deleting something else, which is really annoying. So I can't use the Lidl app at all now! | App advice, update available, you update the app press open to get message update available. Not a great experience | Absolutely hate it. I used to use the old Lidl app to view the weekly offers and add to favourites what I need to buy. It was simple and very convenient, but, unfortunately, no longer available. Lidl Plus has the option to create a shopping list, but it's totally useless - you can't click on the entry to open it for details. It's just text with no details, price or starting date. | Great! | Often creats difficulty in opening the App | Very detailed information about their products. | The animation of the football flying towards me and then application doesn't do anything. That's exactly what I need when I came here to charge my car or standing in line while people waiting. Brilliant | Good shopping app, pity is not available in English. | Very well stocked and easy to get around and prices r also great | Άχρηστη εφαρμογή δεν δουλεύει,δεν στέλνει ποτέ το κωδικο επαλήθευσης. | Good | All good. 4 stars given only because we could do with a bit more variety. The tills in the Pinner branch have very restricted space on the check out counter and ffor trolleys which makes loading the trolley very difficult for cistomers.

The old app (wihthout plus+) is 100% Better. | The shopping list in this app is utterly useless! Items are listed without pictures and without the dates when they are available. No way to plan your shopping like this. After the other Lidl app (which was great for that functionality) was recently discontinued, there should have been a revamp of certain features in this one for a smooth transition to using just this. | terrible app, they don't make any effort to make it better, all discounts dont make any difference when you buy something, its a scam app. | The app's lost it quite frankly! Where's the £2 off £50 spend coupon? The sratchcard is useless. I dont want to win favorina eggs and Easter stuff, I've been winning this all week, amazingly don't win at other times! Bring good coupon offers in from toiletries/laundry range too. Fed up of seeing sausages and wine, coffee and irrelevant offers. | lt was disaster we 2 Senior Cotizens were sent on a wild goose chase to Swords branch having been told we would get our wood logs for the fire there ŵdrove all the way out from Drumcondra to find nothing the chap at the Till told us no branch in Swords stocks them anymore having driven out all the way out there .How can Head get it so wrong. | My raring isn't changed at all. You are tricking customers and it is really annoying. Why do not ACTIVATE your specials automatically??? It is pissing me off. Not those 70c I loose, your system robbing those small bits is not fair | You ruined the ""Lidl"" app with the nice shopping list and forced us to use the shopping list in the Lidl Plus app which is horrible. | Good | App is ok but staff not scaning discounted item's as discounted but normal price! Can't login! No easy way to restore password! | Since the last update it takes literally minutes to start the app. I am not a football fan, the mascots in the beginning do not worth it. | Love lidl | After update ow it takes too long to startup! | The recently added shopping list feature is totally useless in its present form. In the now discontinued Lidl app, the shopping list feature was near perfect. | It was good | Not possible to install this application for more than one country. I would like to use it even when travelling abroad. | Slow | For some reason I can only select Lidl GB stores? I am not in GB, I don't live there, my phone isn't set to there, I don't have a vpn there. Why can I only get the British version of the app all of a sudden? It was fine before? | All is well | Remove the bear. I want to use the app and not watch some unneeded animation with too much wait time. | I enjoy shopping with you ☺️ | Very good | Horrible | The leaflet on Lidl was better. Do it like tha | Terrible, I cant to see number of my card. It is too hard to make a registration. | Even the home shop canon not be selected. Not from the map where YouTube Canon see the Shop but it Canon not Best selected by the adressi or the shop's name. Using of the App is impossible! | Shopping list of Lidl plus compared to lidl shopping list is total disaster no photos, no price, no promotion date. Who created this terrible app? Don't stop the old lidl app from 15.03. I rate this app below 1* | As always good experience 👌 | As an o. a. p. i find it difficult yo use this app and more difficult to find the items on this app in store. I always feel rushed at checkout . | This app is a complete head melt from start to finish, the only good thing about it is the digital receipts. | Overraskende god og velfungerende app. | Good | Everything I need at lower prices than any one else and quality and servicec | Excellent | After the last update you see the products on leaflets | after latest update doesnt work | Good | Sunt multumita pt ca au produse minunate oricand. | Got charged for a free bag... | Very good lidl market and staff | New update: app is working better these days. Prizes are mostly bakery items though (rarely anything for people who have to stay healthy). The app is also an annoying football advert now. | Bad marketplace | No English if you live in the Netherlands | Shopping list - Incantata de faptul ca la ultimul update s-a adăugat opțiunea listei de cumpărături, chiar aveam nevoie de asta, dar cred ca mai are nevoie de niște îmbunătățiri. As prefera sa pot vedea mai multe informații despre produsele pe care le adaug direct din aplicație, cum ar fi: din ce oferta fac parte(de luni sau de joi), o poza cu produsul, pretul etc | Super | The wishlist should show picture of the said product if added from the digital offer list | It is not working..... | Useless, if you go in the market, 5pm you have nothing to buy from coupons! This heppens all time! And this includes basic things such as fruit, dairy products! | Nice | Pare o prostie. Mereu o ia din zero. Nu știu ce rost are sa scanezi qr-ul ala. | I'm sure it's good, but unusable for me as the moment I pass the threshold of my local Lidl I lose phone reception. Sure, I can stand outside in the car park and use the app but I'm not that dedicated. | Awesome | Good app | I cannot find how to vhange my email address. | Any chance of being able to add my Lidl qr code too Google wallet, so i could use it on my wear os watch. It would make life so much easier! | Findet nur Läden in wo auch immer, sind Alle auf Englischen Straßen. Stellt sich heraus das ich die Länderwahl übersehen habe. Hab dennoch Probleme mit dem Code der nicht ankommt. | Good quality off goods staff helpful and happy | Magazinul meu preferat!Angajatii de pe str.Bistritei sunt cei mai draguti! | It is ok | Great. | Why have you requested an update just 13 days after the last one?? My phone won't accept another one so I no longer can use Lidl Plus! | Slow to load since update | Good | Exelrnt | Since lidl app update unable to open app, cant see coupons etc. If its not fixed asap its off to aldi for me | Very heĺpful and very user friènďlý | Pay Attention. The lidl plus prices on the shelves are not valid unless you active some coupon. The cashier asks if you have lidl plus, but not if you have activated the right coupon. That way they seduce you to make unnecessary and overpriced purchases. | Treats not showing up on card | Great | Like the concept of the app, but every time I tried to log in, it either says my account is not recognised or something went wrong, I wasn't able to log in once. Tried troubleshooting but didn't work. | Please Add all Languages In your language section in the app i live in Austria but I don't understand German then how can I use the app so Please add Languages in the app ASAP. | Excellent thank you | Why can't you get your app right and avoid having to update? | A difficult exercise to get properly registered, for an o.a.p like me... But after many visits with failed attempts, the last checkout girl finally sorted it for me... She deserves a medal !!!! | The app is crushing all the time, resulting in missing vouchers/special offers etc | Easy to use, practical and saves money. | Lidi has become one of the food store's to go into now you can get most items you are looking for. The app is worth going onto it inform you very well it is sò good the coupons are very welcoming | Amazing value | Good quality .Great bargain. Lovely friendly staff 😊 all away out to help and take time to listen to you. Take Time Explain . Very happy to shopping in lidl. Shopping there since opened .

However, the other app is much simpler to browse this weeks offer, plus you can also see next weeks offer. So why only 3 stars, i much prefer the layout for offers on the other app. So a shame they are taking it away. This app can be quite slow and sluggish at times, but its pretty stable most times. | can't get into new version | The app is very good, everything sent straight to your phone, coupons and special offers. But why do we need to update it every couple of months, it's very frustrating 😤! | New but seem 👌 | New edit: I just saw that lists were added, but you can't sync them with the normal Lidl app. So you still have 2 apps for one store. Even though you advertise the next week during the previous week, you can't activate the coupons until Monday morning... that's bad for those of us making our lists during the weekend... | When entering my town it won't let me hit select so I'm unable to get my local store | Every time Keep asking for updates so annoying 😞 | bad can't find any my city stores | excellent | Fantastic and exceptional | I love 🛍 at lidle very reasonably priced | A good app but it's frustrating when coupons are on the app for the same sales area but you can only activate one as the other shows as incompatible. They should all be able to be used, especially when some of them are from scratchcards or from the spend amount rewards | Unlike tesck in lidl you can get real money not points | Nice little discounts, most welcome | Good food | I always found it okay as it was | I hate constantly uploading | The forced updates are usually cosmetic without fixing the core problems. I managed to get the forced update and the only difference is an idiotic panda bear for football commercial at the starting screen. Waste of my data. Focus on improving core functionality and app stability. | App shows deliberately misleading ads and sales. This is quite tiring. Latest one: ""all prices are the same in all Lidl shops"" and in tiny font ""for basket of 15 products"". All traditional ""50% off!"" actually applying only for second product. That is 25% sale, not 50% sale. | Well if travelling between North of Ireland and South. North store's can't be added. | La intrarea în fiecare magazin Lidl există un loc de fumat. Nu contează că magazinele sunt utilizate și de nefumători, nu contează că intri cu un copil în brațe, trebuie să duhnești a hoit de fiecare dată când intri la ei și rare sunt dățile când nu fumează cineva. O fi chiar atât de greu să mutați duhnitoarea după colț, sau măcar la câțiva metri de intrare? | Doesn't load further than logo after the most recent update | Good | Great | Good | Good store | Need to sort out their coupons. I got two coupons for two different things (Coupon Plus and Birthday) and they claim they're 'incompatible' so I have to go round twice. I can't believe this isn't resolvable - it's obviously been left in place so they can appear generous safe in the knowledge that only half of their 'generosity' will ever be used. | You cannot use it without updating, really frustrating. If you have no internet connection, you just simply loose money. Not user-friendly at all!! | Impossible to display customer code or QR code without mobile network. And there is usually no network coverage inside their stores. As consequence you cannot scan you customer's code... | schlecht | A cut above the rest. | coupons dumbest concept ever | The language is set depending in which country you are, and you cannot change it.

Možná to dejte konečně nějaké firmě, místo toho, aby to psali děti na základní škole v rámci výuky o špatném softwaru. | The worst app I've downloaded in a while. Huge step back from the original. At this moment it's much better for Czech sports fans to just pay for SkySports or Paramount+ which come at the same price and with much more reliable platforms and content. Stay away from O2. They only have so many subscribers because they own the market in Czech republic. Their service is disastrous | 02/2024 - Možná se trochu zlepšila trhanost pohybu v EPG. Stále je to nedodělek (jak je vůbec možné hromadně převádět lidi na tuto novou verzi, která ztratila některé (veškeré dobré) vlastnosti předchozí verze, a to už bude tato 2.0 aplikace možná rok od uvedení) - chybí podpora Chromecast - v EPG přehledu nelze kliknout na jméno kanálu a tam si vybrat pořad, nelze ""vyskočit"" z aplikace a mít obraz v malém okně. | Aplikace se ani nenačte | Původní aplikace byla ve všech ohledech lepší. Např. rychlejší, bylo možné nastavit kvalitu, přehlednější, není možné si vytvořit vlastní seznam stanic, při scrollování v programu se aplikace seká a chová skoro jak chce. | Unusable, unresponsive, crashing all the time a real shame and thr worst is that this has been like this without any improvements for monthsa dm getting worse with every update | Doesn't work at all | Still bad | nufunguje zde nic | Opravdu velmi nepovedena aplikace. Ani se neda prihlasit. Neustale hlasi, ze mam spatne heslo a nabizi jeho obnovu. Na puvodni aplikaci heslo pritom funguje. | Kdy bude aplikace podporovat Chromecast with Google TV HD? Proč v seznamu programů nelze vyfiltrovat oblíbené? Proč je 2.0 aplikace horší než ta původní? A proč je pomalejší? Viděli jste někdy appku Netflixu? Ta je proti vaší aplikaci jak z jiné galaxie... | Way worse then 1.0 | Poooor | Tohle je příklad toho jak se aplikace nemá dělat. Neskutečně se seká i na rychlém mobilu. | Application is quite good. But why is not able to scroll programs forward? | Už přihlašování do aplikace je hrozné. Proč se nemůžu přihlásit pomocí aplikace v telefonu nebo aspoň využívat nativní klávesnici? | Hrozna aplikace, a vubec nejhorsi mi pripada, ze z venku to vypada jak kdyby na appce pracoval jeden vyvojar na pul uvazku, protoze pri mnozstvi bugu, o kterych O2 musi vedet, bych ocekaval release kazdy tyden/dva a ne ze posledni release byl pred dvema mesici. Nekdo v O2 se proste totalne zblaznil a ja nechapu, jak tohle muze seniorni vedeni tak dlouho trpet. | To jako vážně nemáte verzi pro Chromecast 4? | EDIT: Vaše odpověď: „Dobrý den, Chromecast v současné době nepatří mezi podporovaná zařízení pro sledováni 02 TV. Důvodem je nedostatečná podpora ze strany výrobců televizorů.“ O jaké nedostatečné podpoře je proboha řeč? Chromecast podporuje každá (i hloupá) televize, která má HDMI vstup. Tohle byste mohli trochu rozvést. Každopádně když jsem si stáhl apk balíček O2 TV pro Android TV a nainstaloval ho na Chromecast, fungovalo to dobře. | Nepodporuje casting do televize, prohlížení EPG je neskutečně pomalé, není možné rychle přepínat titulky/zvuk při přehrávání (možné pouze hluboko v menu aplikace), nemá režim na šířku při procházení menu. Opravdu velmi nepovedená aplikace, bohužel. | Je to pomalejší, než dříve, neintuitivní a teď se navíc stále zapínají titulky i když je vypneme a podrobnosti o zvoleném kanále asi překrývají kus obrazovky, protože nelze zobrazit kanál s menším číslem, než 11. | Otřes. Pomalá, nejde nastavit kvalitu streamu, takže je video rozmazané. ... Já potřebuju ZVÝŠIT rozlišení videa, OMG! | Naprosto strašné a pomalé ovládání. Na setop boxu nefunguje dálkový ovladač. Tlačítka pro rychlou volbu funkci nefungují. Při konci časového slotu pro daný pořad se objeví kolečko beznaděje a po 5 až 10 sekundách pořád pokračuje. Úplně pomale. Proti verzi 1 horší ovládání a to i v apce na mobilu. Vraťte to zpět prosiiiiiim. A nakonec dostanete odpověď podobnou co jsem dostal na prodejně. Když ten kabel není metr podzemí tak kopejte tak do 5 až 6 metrů tam určitě bude :) | Předchozí verze na TV Philips fungovala bez problémů. O2 TV 2.0 se při každém prvním spuštění načítá tak dlouho (někdy i při načítání zamrzne) , že je to daleko za hranicí použitelnosti. Škoda, že nejdou dávat hvězdičky do mínusu. Otřesný zážitek. | Bylo by dobrÿ,kdyby jste implementovali funkci zvětšení obrazu,jak bylo u předchozí verze | Doesn't work on other devices, nightmare!!! | Predchozi verze fungovala. Bohuzel se to o teto verzi rici neda :-(. Na mem TV boxu (Android) naprosto nepouzitelne :-( Pokud se tato situace v kratke dobe nezlepsi, budu nucen odejit k jinemu poskytovateli. | Velmi spatna aplikace, zmena k horsimu proti predchozi verzi. Napr. navigace v programu, pohyb ui neni synchronni s gesty - posunem prstem, je zrychlovan. Nebo, u nahravek se nova verze se snazi o seskupovani poradu v serii, ale dostanete se k tomu poslenimu, coz je super, musite se divat pozpatku, nebo zmizelo tlacitko pro primy pristup z nahravkam, misto toho je tam 'Sport', ale na kazdy se chce divat jak jini cvici. Proste to O2 pekne odflaklo, myslim, ze konkurenti maji lepsi appku. | Seká se, padá, nejde zobrazit jeden program na svislé stránce, nestíhají se načítat názvy programů (na samsung galaxy tab 7)... jednoznačná změna k horšímu ve srovnání s předchozí verzí | Zpackaná hrůza! | Strašný Edit: stále strašný. Doufám, že o2 ztratí vysílací práva na ligu mistrů, abych se toho mohl konečně zbavit. | Server errors all the time. Poor UX | Ani nevim, jestli dat vubec 1 hvezdu. Nevim, kdo tohle vymyslel, ale musel byt pravdepodobne v nejakem straslivem stavu. Neda popsat sada vsech tuposti - od abslutne neintuitivniho ovladani, pres katastrofalni pomalost odezvy az nemoznost vytvorit vlastni seznam programu. Pri EPG nejde zvuk. K tomu, aby se clovek dostal k menu aplikace potrebuje navod. Vratte tu puvodni a fakt nedelejte ""vylepseni"", ktere je jednim slovem hruza. Testery jste asi nezapojili. Tohle by s nimi snad nemohlo projit. | Nepouzitelne.. Krok zpatky oproti stare appce. Pomala, neumi hrat pri praci s jinou app v malem okne, osobni seznam programu zmizel a novy nejde vytvorit, musim chodit pres program vsech kanalu, coz je silene, posouvani na casove ose ve videu takrka nefunguje,... Vynutili jste prechod na novou app, ale je to smejd, vratte starou app, nebo penize za sluzbu o2tv! Edit: na samsung tv 2017 nova app vubec nefunguje, stara fungovala i na 2016 modelech.. Zvazuji konkurenci a nejsem sam.. | Původní aplikace O2 TV fungovala bezvadně, o této se to bohužel říct nedá. Aplikace se seká a teď se přidala další super věc - zhruba po 15 minutách sledování aplikace napíše chyba spojení a pak se celá zrestartuje. Po tomto restartu se vždy spustí o 180 stupňů jinak než je orientace obrazovky. Je jedno jestli jsem na datech nebo wifi, v obou případech se to děje. | Wou O2 seems to want lost customers paying for services as it would be with TV (virtually free) and whole the time its not working or they are doing best to prevent me from watching it! This APP is laggy + cant be streamed into chrome cast. Ultimated combo is with Prima others providers will allow you to look eq from half of movie etc (only comercials are blocked), but not O2. So you can watch to an movie then theirs internet will be dropped and you can start watching it from start only. Bravo | Nemožný najít změnu kvality obrazu | O2TV nepodporuje ChromeCast 4... Vodafone, T-Mobile, VOYO, NEJTV, TElly, KoDi, KUKI, PODA to zvládli, ale O2 stále nic a ještě k tomu zablokovala aplikaci O2TV instalovnou z apk. Děkujeme... Kdy se dočkáme? | Nefunguje Chromecast!!! | Buggy, resources way to hungry... stopped using it. | Previous ""obsolete"" version was way better. When I cast (mirror) my screen to chromecast, it transfers only sound, picture is not transferred. This was working correctly in old app. Seems that war against chromecast escalates. Flipping through the program is jerky and it takes time to load and overall is very unpleasant. Cannot list through programs when phone is sideways. Overall this update kills nearly all usage of o2tv for me. I am very disappointed. | Po čekání na postupně uvolnění pro televize TCL jsem čekal vyladěný produkt a dočkal se nejhorší VOD aplikace ze všech. Fakt jsem zkusil od Netflixu po Sky a žádná není tak hrozná jako tohle. Na všechno čekám, tlačítka reagují s hroznům zpožděním, pokud TV vypnu bez ukončení aplikace, po startu je šílené dlouho nepoužitelná. Pravidelně musím aplikaci zabít, někdy hraje i na pozadí. Aplikace ČT je ve srovnání dokonalá. Promarněná příležitost u skvělého produktu, smutné. | totální trash app, žere výkon, neintuitivní design... všechno špatně | Díky bohu, že jsem instalaci nové verze zakázal. Jak může obří firma, jako O2, vypustit takový brutální paskvil, je pro mě nepochopitelné. Obzvláště, když první verze byla relativně slušná... | Líná TV aplikace. Nelze použít tlačítka na zastavení, spuštění, ani pauzy přehrávání na ovladači. Musím stisknout dvě tlačítka, dolů a OK, abych mohl zapauzovat či spustit film. Přetáčení dopředu/dozadu je peklo. Je velice snadné přeskočit o 40 minut, i když chci jen o 5 minut. Nové UI má méně funkcí a je komplikované, změňte ho. Nutit zákazníky přejít na horší aplikaci je arogance. Teď to nefunguje a je zpět stará aplikace. Doufám, že hlavoun, co to protlačil, přijde minimálně o prémie. | Katastrofa, nechápu, že si někdo v dnešní době dovolí pustit ven takovou aplikaci a ještě si nechá za ""TV"" platit tolik, kolik O2. | Why can't the O2 app be installed on Chromecast 4? Can you fix that? When can we expect it will be done? | pomalé a nestabilní | Ještě horší appka než ta předchozí. Ovládání na TV je úplně k ničemu. Často hlásí poruchu nebo problémy s připojením i když internet funguje. Tak používám jiného providera. | Aplikace je oproti předchozí pomalá. Vše se dlouho načítá, vypadává, během přehrávání běžného pořadu mi to několikrát skočilo do menu bez přičinění, menu je nepřehledné. Přes celou obrazovku jede obraz toho, co dávají, což není vůbec potřeba a zároveň to všechny položky odsune níž. Aplikace jsou nesmyslně seřazeny vedle sebe a ne pod sebe, takže když chci tu poslední, musím se tam proklikat. Na mobilu se mi TV seká. Po každé cca půl minutě zamrzne obraz na sekundu. Pořad jde špatně přetáčet. :( | To si snad děláte pr... ne? Tohle je nejhorší app jakou jsem za poslední roky viděl. Kdo to optimalizoval? Nějací učni na kalkulačkách? .. Oproti staré aplikaci zalagované, nepoužitelné, nepřehledné... Tohle Vám trvalo takovou dobu? Kde jsou základní funkce jako třeba podpora Chromecast? Velký fail | Without Chromecast support it's just a useless app. Definitely going to consider another provider, as O2 can't give us something useful. | V appce nelze nastavit rozlišení a tím pádem kvalita obrazu. Po spuštění jiné appky nezůstává miniaturní okno s přenosem pro rychlý návrat zpátky ke sledování, ba se dokonce přenos přeruší, člověk přijde i o audio | Aplikace se dlouho načítá a v průběhu se pořád zasekává, i když mám rychlé a stabilní připojení k internetu. | Neskutečně špatná aplikace. Evidentně je to pouze WebView webové verze, takže optimalizace neexistuje. Načítá se dlouho. Program se nedá používat. Kdybyste aspoň nechali přístupnou starou verzi. Ta se aspoň dala používat. Kdyby tu jen byla nějaká možnost 3. stran. Lidi by byli schopní udělat mnohem lepší aplikace. Škoda. | Verze 2.0 je děsně pomalá. Špatně reaguje při posouvání v tel programu, vždycky sebou škubne tak, že si musím ověřit ve které části dne se to octlo. Je neintuitivni. Kam zmizely nahrávky. Sport mě nezajímá. Schází sdílení na Chromecast, které je pro naši rodinu stěžejní. Čas změnit internetového poskytovatele? Dejte lidem na výběr, kterou verzi používat. | Aplikace je vyrazne pomalejsi nez predchozi a nyni jiz nezobrazi obsah vubec .... programatori nejspis nejsou i uzivatele teto aplikace a pak to takto vypada. | Tato nova app 2.0 má zásadní nedostatky (v porovnaní s původní verzí): 1. Velice velice pomala (jak na mobilních datech tak i hlavně na wifi) 2. Neda se nastavit rychlost/kvalita videa/streamu v app na telefonu (v původní verzi bylo min. 5 možností). Možnost SD/HD/auto je možná pouze na PC verzi (kterou velká většina sleduje stejně na wifi, kde je standartně dostatek dat pro 'HD as default') 3. App na telefonu nefunguje na pozadí (což předchodí verze umožňovala). Vše nutno zásadně vylepšit asap | Neuvěřitelně neresponzivní, vše trvá strašně dlouho. Po přepnutí jinam se po pár vteřinách ozve zvuk přehrávaného pořadu. | Chyba přehrávaču | Stále nejde používat s chromecast, naprosto základní věc..... | Nemuzu stahnout na projektoru s android tv 12. Nejde stahnout na playsta. Z mobilu streamovat nejde. Sežente si pořádný vývojáře konečně. | Nepodporovaný ani Xiaomi stick. | Prosím, hlavne neodstraňuje starú verziu. Nová verzia je pomalá, chýba história v náhradných programoch. Nedá sa prehrávať Prima kanál, keď ešte beží a pod. Každopádne ďakujem, že sa snažíte aplikáciu vylepšovať. | toto review bylo napsano pomoci externi klavesnice. Jelikoz neni jak a komu napsat zpetnou vazby a O2 support konstatuje, ze odmita o problemech komunikovat, tak tedy maji zakaznici smulu. But to prosim delejte poradne nebo radeji vubec. Google ma samozrejme take rezervy ale v tomto pripade je to vec pouze O2 TV. Jinak bych toto nebyl schopen napsat na klavesnici. | Priserny. Neda se nastavit kvalita obrazu a ikdyz jsem na 100mb wifi, porady mi bezi na nejhorsi kvalitu, puvodni aplikace taky nebyla zadny slagr, ale tahle je uplne priserna..... | I can no longer cast to Chromecast with this new version. | Naprostá zoufalost. Vůbec nefunguje. Nejhorší je, že původní aplikace která vypadá že jede svižně a vždycky fungovala bez problémů, tak mi nedovolí pouštět obsah a odkazuje mě na tuto novou verzi. Nová mi ale vůbec nenajizdi, několik minut se točí a točí a točí... A nic. Za tohle platím? Abych koukal minuty na tocici se kolečko az mi dojdou nervy a radši to vypnu. | The worst app ever, I believe you already know that the reason. In the first place its not user friendly and 2nd hand I downloaded it on my Samsung TV but its completely worthless (lags and too slow) and already contacted your IT team he knew nothing about it. Put all these problems aside I ordered this package online, so why the heck can't cancel my subscription online?? Why I should come to you to cancel it?? I just don't get it!!!!! | Dobry den, hodlate vratit do aplikace funkci chromecast? | Tak pomalé,ze aplikaci v podstatě neni možné ovládat. | Co jste to vydali za .....? Nacita se to pomaleji nez starsi verze. Kdyz uz nabehne, UI je desive pomale. Ficury ktere fungovali na starsi nefunguji ted, jako napr. prehravani na pozadi. Fullscreen mod funguje blbe a stale je videt lista. A kvalita prehravani take skace, coz musi byt chyba v aplikaci, ne siti, protoze sit je stabilni Gb a schvalne si vedle pustil potom 4k stream a v klidku. OS stejna verze, pripojen jsem pred Gb wifi. Fakt tuhle stahnete z marketu a nechejte starsi verzi. | Nevím co dvojka přinesla dobrého, ale ztráta filtru programů je pro mne velmi bolestná.","{""1"":6305,""2"":318,""3"":179,""4"":89,""5"":328}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","O2 Czech Republic a.s.","O2+Czech+Republic+a.s.","aplikace@o2guru.cz","https://www.o2.cz","O2 Czech Republic a.s.

However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable."",""The app is mostly fine. I can't believe that reels, which is basically rebranded Instagram TV or whatever it was called, is still so glitchy. I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck. Have to restart the app. The time slider doesn't work or disappears half the time. And every time I open a suggested reel, it tells me I can scroll to see more. Like as though I don't know that by now. Also, where is the opt back in to political suggested posts? Does it even exist? Or are you lying?"",""So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! 🤦"",""I like instagram, but this app has a lot of issues lately. Ever since updating the app a couple of weeks ago, I can no longer add my own posts to my story. The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with."",""I use this app primarily to post content for my clients but I have grown to love to create content. Cool video, cute meter's , reels and stickers on the stories. But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying.

Awful company 👎 | How do you accept a request and then on your way out you decide not to go and ask client to get out and its raining. I horrible I hate this app | nice ride | Very good, no nonsense driver, knows the road well | fast service | nice reliable | very efficient and very good driver | Reliable | i love it 😍 | good driver | convince | Good expirence throughout | Excellent | Good | I've never encountered very difficult situations I'm very happy I arrive everywhere I Wana go at the right time unless otherwise | very good | Bad quality and increases prices too much | clean car | Reliable | Excellent 👍 | Ok | best driver | in simple words, perfect | I requested for a ride today and was patiently waiting for the rider for over 30mins then he missed the road,he eventually got into the street and I asked him to come down because of my kids and what I was carrying, he turned around and left....like really after I waited for more than 30minutes | very nice one | Pleci in cursa cu o suma și la finalul cursei afli că ți s-au luat mai mulți bani din cont. | still haven't been refunded for a cancelled ride | nice | quick pick up and journey | first experience is really amazing. | Great services | great app some times has great promotions | Bolt drivers are used to asking for destination, most often drivers turn down request after they ask of destination. It makes me wonder if the behavior | reliable and safe | good | Excellent service 💯 | Nice and fast I like it | fast,safe travel and clean | still keeping us moving 🔥🔥🔥✅🅿️ | Easy,quick,comfortable and cheapest option!:))Great.Cheers💯🥳👌 | it's quite and peaceful when using bolt and the drivers are very polite and trust me I will continue use it | always helpfull | 👌👌❤️ | good service 👍🏼 | perfect and safe | always a good option | Stole my money 2 times | very nice and helpful. | Cool | Good app for trips. | It was absolutely terrible change your services please,it puts fake prices and will change after you have arrived,but will put another price when starting off | bolt is the next best thing | The agreed Fare is not corresponding | The riders cancel my order 1 min before arriving and had to wait another 15 minutes for the next driver. Increased prices too. Not ok at all. | Love the smell of a clean thank u driver. | I don't recommend him. | bad | best taxi service for Manchester | Tell us the actual price instead of fluctuating the price | a efficient app,the ride is very nice,it's way better than a uber or a taxi | Good | good | Very satisfied | waiting time to get to connect unnecessarily long | excellent | Not ideal if you go on this on a spur of the moment. By the time I found an escooter with enough charge I was given too much useless pointless and irrelevant information. What they should have told me is that I had paid for 3 hours. Because I stopped for coffee and ended the ride I only got 50 minutes use. I had to pay again which is a complete joke. Usual tourist rip off. I will dispute the charge with my credit card company. Apart from that the ride was fun but these are dangerous for the city | I have had great rides with Bolt so far | exceptionally good | Nice | reliable and convinient | It's convenient and it has friendly drivers. | it only works on random days. | very good | good | lovely | Nice drive and music | Unable to register because sms was never received.... | good | his such an amazing driver, very funny too | very good and respectful driver | rudeness | The driver didn't delay.

Right on time | صاءق ممتاز شكرا | Always good | very good and fast service and track online | wonderful driver | awesome app | It's a pretty good app for transportation but some rides tend to get expensive | good car and kind driver | bad service | the app is not good in picking up the pickup area | I have had the worst experience with you guys, I will not recommend this app at all, as you scam people and clearly you don't profile your driver's well... What you are scamming people... What you advertise, it's not actually what you give. This app is 🚮 Trash.... If you comfortable with being scammed, use this | he's the driver | I love my bolt | Excellent services | the best | COMFORTABLE & SAFE RIDE | He is very good driver and nice man | Good driver | redical worship | Great 👍 | awesome and calm | nice person from different world | first one added extra 1700 | good guy always in time | best way to get around germany | Love it | Wery good serwes👍 | good communicator and punctual with time | Everything is in point | Reliable for travel | The 👌 best | cool riding | well done driver | good | Friendly driver | Good | good person | I ordered a ride, the estimated arrival time of the driver was 5 minutes. 20-25 minutes have passed, and the driver was just driving in circles in the city with another passenger, his ETA was still 5 minutes. I had to cancel the ride, bc I was running out of time. Upon canceling I received a message from Bolt, saying I will be charged, because I cancelled after a grace period. Why was I the one who was charged, when I was almost late because of the driver? Unfair practice. No refunds were given. | I'm comfortable with the bokt | Sometimes i hardly get any drivers | drivers are very scarce to find and work on the maps , some address appears on the maps but drivers are unable to access it | Booked a taxi from Orly airport to Hotel for 22 euros. Taxi driver (Adel) accepted the booking but he ended up requesting 52.70 euros when we arrived at destination. Terrible experience | excellent | Hello did you charged2 times | I wouldn't dream of using this app in Paris again...had at least five drivers cancel my fair to the airport wasting twenty minutes for a pick-up. I guess it has the wrong type of drivers on it in Paris. | clean car & smooth ride. | good | love the service | Always works superbly | very comfortable and admirable | Best way to get around | showing less fare at initial and at the time of dropping it's showing higher amount | good fast and cheap | The driver was very patient | This app is easy to use and affordable | Bolt keeps charging me more than it showed when I ordered a ride. Shady business practice. What's the point of telling me what the fare is going to be if you're gonna charge more anyway. Uninstalling after 3 years of use. | Very good | Your drivers are requested their amounts outside bolts recommended amount | great | nice driver | simply the best..! | She is such an amazing soul, down to earth... Just love her❤️ | very happy | Good | لصوص | Good | very nice | Quick response. | whyvdo the maps show different oints from where you book? | very Good man | ,👌 | Convenience at it's best!! | perfect App I'm satisfied 👍 | excellent ride | Best trip! | In | Good driver, very informative, many thanks. | Excellent | Super great | Good service | 7x za sebou odmítli jízdu. | They stol 10 dollars from me | the driver is so rude | great app. minus 1 star for high number of drivers without proper documents | good | good man | good | For some reason l can't request a ride and l have no idea why! | good service | the best | cool | Efficient | it's an easy and user friendly app. it helps a lot to me during my time in bkk | excellent response | IT MAKES MY LIFE EASIER COZ I DONT HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG TIME TO GET TO WERE IM GOING. | wonderful driving experience.","{""1"":141296,""2"":32011,""3"":64023,""4"":254696,""5"":5396683}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Bolt Technology","8420210619522248974","info@bolt.eu","https://bolt.eu/",,"https://bolt.eu/en/legal/privacy-for-riders/","8420210619522248974","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TRCKh9Uk5mME5lVDZBAVmBMyBEiumHw4Ef9MTAnRqgcK8MEr4M8jqqBDGX_pKVBffpo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4fwBtCrGS8AVzARJqzMjtau6VpFnL3Wk5Puv1RPNwTWPaWXyYOd6gezfQAQ8Lva9KA","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JdMIc4FxlJVFYBU8RKm_CE5RjzacEWduPbxsSk5TX2apof64l8O8P5K5UyMG6VRp5Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AAWlMrVVKyfqaUzctBVQqf4pyj9L__aW8dTE50271xMd847NovQu3UUVTSP2DVouQ7c"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yzrpnwkGaA5Hsc2LtYspzIsscHHBuMWwajVe8t2P-wy_gVRIYQYYpbEq4BP50MdPgyE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/st2jgjOyEsUFawMBERCCPNMrtwBppLyWQrwz_SiY_CQlRZIgpC50rIbqRXmFiQETvg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TRrajqLFSiKhWkVbAU0gB1HpbPSRJ5N1L0ndNADRgMbHCKQwBQZ3QIbXw3UVzwiMX4A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JLtqgoPiirtmTA7mLnJo2CHZclcPYaiqNAcGVXxA9gZKx1T0wi951BU0RSfS7xWyOW1H""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jul 19, 2013",1711137166000,"CA.108.0","Thanks for using Bolt!<br><br>We regularly update the app to provide a consistently high-quality experience.

Your feedback helps us improve.","[""Sometimes Bolt app substitutes the name of a well-known location (eg Main Railway Station) with a wrong address that is not even visible in the app. So you end up being dropped somewhere around but not at the entrance to a building as expected. But they don't want to fix it, advising instead to check pin on the map, tell the driver where exactly you need to go etc. Taking additional steps on a user side doesn't improve user experience. Especially disappointing as before it worked normally."",""App itself is great, but the drivers are generally quite bad. Breaking rules, dirty cars, I always see a Bolt driver breaking traffic or parking rules every time I walk the streets in my neighborhood. Too many instances to keep reporting this, it is a general problem caused by the pressure to offer a low price. Use a different app if you can, drivers of other services have to be certified taxi drivers and it makes a big difference."",""Ok for finding rides, but really scammy approach when it comes for ride price sometimes. Imagine you take a ride, it all goes well, no traffic, the driver took the best road, and you arrived safely. In the end, you can be charged 2x more because \""there was a surge in demand while you were on the way, so we will charge you extra more after you confirmed your initial price\"". Also doesn't give a hint that there might be extra charges for toll/airport/etc. Also lacks \""reserve a ride\"" feature."",""After seeing the ride shown as £5.30 on Google Maps, I gave it a go. I installed the app and handed over my personal details, I checked the ride cost and it was £8.30. I feel duped by Bolt and Google Maps. Update: I checked the app 20 minutes later and saw the price dropped to £5.60. The app required you pay the amount before searching for a driver. No drivers were nearby or accepted the ride. After waiting 5 mins, I cancelled and went with Uber who charged £6.98 but had lots of cars available."",""I have suggestions. Have in mind that I use Bolt 2-wheels on a daily basis. 1 - There is no way to extend or renew a pass. I buy the monthly pass and I have to either wait the days to pass or consume 100% of my pass balance to then buy a new one. 2 - 99% of the time the app crashes when I hit END RIDE button. I always have to close the app and reopen it to end my ride. 3 - The menu doesn't always show the button for Scooter and e-bike pass, I have to turn on the GPS and Data in order to see it.""]",false,false,false,"ee.mtakso.client","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.mtakso.client&hl=en&gl=CZ"

It's kinda annoying.😏 | Wonderful | Good shopping | My order has missing items and it is Impossible to get a refund as there is no proper customer service. | Amazing app so cheap I would definitely recommend | This app is just amazing | It's not interesting | Good clothing app with many discounts and reasonably affordable highly recommend | TOO MANY NOTIFICATIONS.... 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔 | Only just downloaded appno purchases | Gusto ko tong app na ito marami magaganda and very affordable p. Ang ayaw ko lang ung latest nila logistics ngayon ay ang FLASH EXPRESS PLEASE SHEIN PHILLIPINE PALITAN NIYO LOGISTICS dito s Luzon hindi nakakatuwa pangit ng serbisyo nila mabagal, walang update at pangit ng fedback ng FLASH EXPRESS, matagal super late mag deliver sira sira na yung box. Please no to Flash express no no.. Both branch nd courier hindi namin gusto serbisyo nila | This one like Indian flag colour, how can sell this module | So gooddd.. everything on there is affordable | Haven't heard of it | Excellent experience, top notch. | Ok | Complete loot box scam. Stay away | SHElNShoppingOnl | I'm in the ship and ordering at this app. Unfortunately, I can't order now. I'm using Visa for the payment but now it can't proceed. Please help me with this. | This app was my favorite and I buy there all the time, but recently they become awful. The customer service is ridiculous.They don't help they are intentionally.Drag you along just not to give you a refund. They don't have a common sense. And they don't understand apparently english cause every time they react differently to what I say. Potato, and they answer me cheesecake. There is no connection between both of the things. I'm really angry and I think how I can make. Something | Worst experience of my life 😡😤💢💢💢💢😡😡🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 never download 🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🙅🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 | greate verry good | Trash. You have no options but have to draw the gift before using the app. Which is a scam | It would be nice that you can be able to delete items out of your wish list. Some items are appearing in your wish list which I did not select. Since I cannot place online orders I order via someone else, but is not able to remove items from your wish list. Please accomodate us | This app kinda goes hard, just like how hard you make the little Asian kids work every year 🔥🔥🔥 | Very excellent | Amazing! | My dad placed and order and payed for everything but nothing came they said the will send it but it's never came and they never gave my dad his money back and we are still waiting and when this happened was last year we never got a reply back nothing we send so many messages but no response no reply nothing We want our money back | Spent 60€ on an order in december. It's near april now and it still hasn't arrived. I called the company delivering the order and they said my package still hasn't arrived from shein. Will never buy anything ever again from shein. | Brilliant | Thank you for my item's I received on 22march everything fitted perfectly and I'm happy with it all, my only gripe is I won 300 point's and I was only given 150. | When i see a top i would want to buy, i look at the sizes (I'm an M), but when i look at the measurements, it's a lot smaller than mine, and tbh it nakes me a bit insecure, It seems like this app is made for poeple that have a skinny figure and the clothes that are in my measurements look aweful, don't make the size L look like it's a size S, PLEASE MAKE IT HOW A SIZE L IS SUPPOSED TO BE | OMG!!! I mean it is such a wonderful app but it is ruining my vibe by all the ads that come out of nowhere like every time I touch something in a game or app to get something A.K.A Shein pops up. I'm fade up and I can't even get out of the ad so I'm literally incredibly furiously in rage right now but there is still a lot of things that I need from Shein.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🙄🙄🙄🙄 | i dont want to see adverts in my fone | Shein is literally the best! I highly recommend | Ahfan Esmail | Good | Very good value love shien shopping. | Maganda Ang Shein shopping kc walang scam kng ano order mo yon talaga Ang matangap mo | Not to bad | تطبيق ❤ | It has a lot of beautiful things and it's doesn't cost to much | Stop sending me ads | I Always Buy From Shien For My School And Bedroom And Clothes Idk What To Do Without It | Quick and love the prices. | I originally had them at 5 starts but heaven help you if you have any issues because trying to contact support is all but impossible and when you finally do get in contact with them they wait until they're 'unable' to help you because your item has been shipped. Very disappointed as I shop with them all the time. I got a very beautiful and fantastic dress for a really affordable price. Like I've bought jeans for more. | Amazing app | Check out the generic responses to comments, this is a perfect example of the Shein customer service experience ... cut and paste BS Here we go again... 🤣...... Hi! Hope you have a nice shopping experience here.... | I love shein but lip products or any makeup product for that matter doesn't ship to smaller countries. Pls start to ship make products to smaller countries | have lots of stuff | I am rating this 0 not 1! You don't deserve to have a rating. I ordered a nice blouse and pants. The package was delivered and I paid it. When I opened the package it was a different item. It looks like dirty rags! My real order is now in the sorting center and I paid for items that I didn't order! I called the rider but he refused to give me his name. I suspect I was duped. The rider created a n order that I never ordered so he can get my money! Customer service sucks. Never order here!!!!!!!!! | Scam inyo promo | not sold on this app | Keep getting onscreen notifications that say ""connect to network"" when i havent even been on the app and am constantly connected to wifi anyway. Almost everything for sale is cheap, which was fine for the cost but now alot of things are expensive which definitely doesnt match the quality. Cant access customer support in app | Great place to buy nice and quality clothes | For shopping, works well. But Shein resets the setting so that they can sell my info almost every single day. Today they reset it 3 times. Extremely scummy. | Yes here I am | ewwww | Stop scrolling me to the bottom of the page after I add something to my cart. That is so annoying. | Bruh, why i can't make a account 😒 | Does what it say*s on the tun | Slowly delivery | Ever since I used Shein, it's always been free shipping. Well, not anymore. SF is even higher than the actual item/s I am buying. Thought of you're a VIP, you always get free shipping as courtesy. Oh well... Hello Temu 💚 | really good | Great | Pretty good | are you not going to make a cod payment? because im a cod user. | They said if i purchased at least 1 item then i would get 5 (cheap) free gifts and i bought 2 things and they wouldn't give me the gifts. Temu will if it said to purchase something to get the gift. I've got 3 of them now. So i invited people and they accepted it and it still won't let me get anything free. They lie when they say you get a free gift. I tried to cancel my order but it won't go through. I tried to delete my account but i have to apply? Whole thing is stupid | Scammed me and my gf | What a waste of 45 mins. I opened to get an offer of free delivery and buy 1 get 2 free. Saved 3 items to basket and thought I'll continue shopping, picked a few more items. I go back to my basket, my first lot are gone and standard delivery costs applied. After scrolling and scrolling I'm not going to repeat this process, sorry but lost this customer before you started with a poor e-commerce platform. They have tried to gamify the process, free crystals, games to pick a card but it's a con | This app is kaka | Good quality products and clothing | Not only does this fast-fashion app involve child labour that pays poor wages for extended amount of shifts, it also takes 7-8 days for the shipping to actually arrive, products will be one-time use or badly designed clothes that undo after 5 months max. Alongside all this baffling execution, they have added in MULTIPLE SCAMS, which gives false hope that you will win extra money and spend it for free. Overall waste of time and money. Any good review is definitely a robot! | App is very glitchy. I cannot place an order or play games on it. | Wow | I brought something from here last year and it never came 😭 | It's good for every one💖😁☺️💝 | It's been 5 weeks and it's supposed to be here 2 weeks ago | Great shopping experience. | Okay, I need size 11 dress shoes. You don't have any. Or some flat shoes to wear. Help me get some shoes in my size. | Fantastic clothes and the price is reasonable you can get different options and styles from children to adults. | I have so much ordering from shein highly recommend ❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Shein has been a life saver. Say goodbye to buying expensive and hello to affordable shopping! Shein hsd the cutest clothes for toddler girls. Their fashion game has been on point lately and I saw things that really caught my eye. I love that they also cater to plus size women. I've finally found my style through Shein. Go Shein! 💕 would be nice if yall can make womens socks, shoes for women like me with larger feet at least a size 11.5-12 and if yall made more J-fashion type clothes. | i can download every app i want | BLippi | Thank you for honesty service | Like it | Taking the rest and getting 😴 😌 | I absolutely love this app. The clothes are great, and they're true to there size listed, and they fit very well. They have beautiful vibrant colors, soft materials, and a very big selection to choose from depending on what you're looking for, you'll find it on here; Formal, summer, beach/pool, Play Clothes, Short Sets, Summer Dresses, Pant Suits, Capri Sets, Church Dresses & Etc. a huge variety to choose from. Check Out this Great Clothes Shopping App. You Will Fall In Love With It Too!! | Love this app🥰🥰 | Too many pop-up ads wasted time for me | خدمة الاسترجاع سيئة للغاية ضياع فلوس ووقت | What an app, everything that is no this app is amazing i like it | Now I change my review cause there is something wrong with my Shein account. At first it was fine from before and now I can't get anything from my account so I had use my son's account from Shein sorry I have to delete it | Good application | Good | Good | The estimated price is a scam, the final price is always higher. It's a Chinese company | For the first time i ordered 10 items almost two month not yet received my ordered....if i knew like that i'd never install app and ordered ...wasted my time | this app is a livesaver i love it | The applications is amazing 👏 👏 👏 | This app is annoying...I need it to be removed from my phone | Zero Rating I received the order after two weeks and the order comes with two strings, but I am asking for something big. Zero Rating | Very very bad shopping app, never buy from shein because they have no return facility , no one will listen to u if u will get something bad, so money is all wasted by buying from shein. They have no customer support system.poorest shopping app | Scam site, my girlfriend order some items 4items to be exact. But when the parcel got received. Instead of the items we order we got TWO TSHIRT FROM THRIFT SHOP. nice shop may god bless you all | App installed itself and showed ads every 30 or so seconds | Perfect | Orders sent to wrong address twice. Address changed on app. 2 orders sent to previous address. Not happy at all. Disabled and very disappointed. | i love it | it's been 19 days and I still didn't receive my delivery! it was estimated 11-15 days! | I have no idea kung ano Ang shien na app na yan | Their clothes is amazing and the app is so easy | Becareful shopping with them. I've been screaming for 2 days. I placed an order worth $256, and almost half my items are missing. I contacted customer support via the app, and they're telling me they can't process my request because, according to their verification at the ""warehouse,"" everything was in the package😭😭one of the items missing was supposed to be my graduation outfit for April 1st but Shein is ignoring my emails and tweets regarding my missing items 😢 this is so heartbreaking 😭💔 | التطبيق مرا حلو جربوا و المنتجات حلواا اوي 💞😭 | Great app | Always our orders are delivered in time.... | Good | Very happy with shein. | Great app | Nice | Okay | I love the app but the only thing is that Shein doesn't have the Botswana Pula (BWP) but it has the location. And I have to use the Rands(ZAR). Please fix this problem. Thank you. | You get NO STARS from me. So I have just found out that this app just took money out of my acct without an order. I never save my bank information on any app and I always use PayPal for protection (which was not supposed to be on file either)so needless to say I'm in dispute with Shein from taking over $125 from my PayPal account that I did not authorize to keep on file😡 and there's no order placed on the app to justify the payment | The app is not working😭😭😭 what wrong with it?!?! | Rec'd wrong item. Was emailed about wrong/missing item. Said if I haven't heard back from them in 3 days to please send another email. I have now sent 4 and can not get anyone to even acknowledge me. I still have not rec'd what I paid for 🤬🤬 | It's a company that offers a very fast delivery to you after ordering. | Beautiful | SIBONGILE SHALE | Very user friendly | Gbohuv | Great merchant | I give three stars because no different then wish or temu it's decent quality things for a lower price. Now that's good and all I've had no problems except with sheins obvious add costs savings by implementing games to win online credit which counts towards purchases but these games are rigged for example one displays the drawings to be two sets of 10 a few 5s and a couple threes after two shares you have to invite friends to earn more but now 0.01 what should I expect from a Chinese ran app tho | good app easy to navigate, I would say there's better quality and that stuff. the app lags out sometimes and makes me leave the app for no reason what so ever.. | Love this app | The app is easy to use and smooth flowing. The colors pop right at you and I know that I want everything they have to offer!!! The prices are fantastic so I can afford a lot. | There are no lion printed phone cases for Galaxy A24 | Great love it 😀 ❤️ | Love it!! ❤️ | Nail It | Poor d3livery system...

Nedej bože na to zapomenout a nechat tam o 200 víc. Ceny bez ní jsou výsměch. Sama od sebe mě aplikace odhlásila z bezpečnostních důvodů jako třeba že by mi někdo ukradl telefon a chtěl použít mých 69 naprosto zbytečných bodů. Ještě musím zjišťovat heslo a přihlašovat se abych si mohl jednou za měsíc v tescu něco koupit. Já chci nakupovat v obchodě aniž bych musel mít pro každej aplikaci zbytečně zabírající místo, je to snad tak těžký? | good | Can't even register. It requires CZ phone number, which I do not possess. Other countries prefixes are not accepted. What do you need my phone number for in the first place?! | amazing | Convenient search would be nice | Vyjemecne musim pochvalit! Moje prvni zkusenost a komentar byli na jednu hvezdu. Ted' po nekolika letech ale zas mam appku na mobilu, a je to fakt rozdil typu den/noc. Moc hezka prace! Nemusim se furt prihlasovat, veskere kupony a t.j. jsou jednoduse v dostupnosti, a toucet info k tomu. Zatim nic nelaguje. Obrovsky pokrok a dobra prace IT teamu! Menim na zaslouzenych 5 hvezdicek :). | good | This company and their app is a joke. My account has been locked for no reason. No answer from customer support. Edit: I did try to reach out to you, but no one cared to answer. When I try to log in it says that my account is locked and to contact support. That's exactly what I did. I sent you an email in 2 languages and no one answered. Funny thing is that my Clubcard works even if I can't log in to my account after you locked it. I also never received a notification that my account was locked | I always go here the store is clear and easy to shop | Awful 😖 you can't get online discount card what ever you do. It is very bad navigation inside the app. Do not recommend. Even workers in tesco couldn't help me. | smazali jste mi bodiky!!!! | Doesn't work, pwd resets do not work either. Edit:as described, I simply can't log in and when I try to reset pwd I don't get any email. I checked spam etc | Wants to know your personal information. | Great | Did not find my clubcard number. The number was copied from Google wallet from where the card is accepted every day and tesco store but this rubbish app does not know my clubcard number. Immediately uninstalled. | It's pretty easy to use the app :) | excellent | all the best | Sbíráte body, ale voucher vlastně nikde. | I coul not a access to register | ""Prodejte vaše soukromí nebo zaplaťte nesmyslné ceny"" by měl být popisek téhle aplikace. Je to nechutná praktika. | Good | Can't even save club card number, what a joke. | ok | Proč mi to dává kupóny, které nemohu uplatnit? Ani chudáci prodavačky si s tím neví rady. Všechny podmínky jsem splnil a stejně musím sledovat jak ten kupón časek vyprchá. Otřes | Doesn't even provide the e-receipt. No way to review purchases. Also, no warning that my points are going to be removed, I lost 700 points! | Best hypermarket's app in czech republic | Not now | Poo | Does not allow to register with a non Czech phone number even if a proper residence address is provided. In 2023, in Europe, I should not need 27+sim cards anymore... | Huge supermarket, with good prices. But, not enough cashiers. You need to hire more of them, and raise their pay, so they can work faster. | Coupons and vouchers can't be scanned at cash register if the phone is in dark mode. It worked before, but doesn't work now. | Forcing update. Is it really ,,a must"" to update? | good experience | Aplikace chce cislo karty, tu mi ale nikde nechteji dat, ani na infu primo v tesku. Pry mam volat na jejich linky, kam se bud neda dovolat.. Tesko timhle akorat stve zakazniky | epickej obchod ale celkem scummy že normální slevy jsou teď clubcard exclusive | Nutnosť mať túto aplikáciu je na hrane zákonnosti. akcie ktoré boli predtým možné mať bez aplikácie sa presunuli na ňu. to ako sú ceny ukazovanie v obchode je na hranici zákonnosti. máte šťastie že som lenivý podať podnet na COI. aplikácia je neprehľada a pla dark ux patternov. keby som chel konspirovat tak poviem že máte uzavretú kartelovú dohodu zo všetkými reťazcami lebo to vyžadujú už úplne všetci. | If they could combine 2 separate apps: clubcard and online shopping, it would be more convenient. | Nelze ani vytvořit nový účet. | Až se budou dát kupóny použít na samoobslužných pokladnách bez asistence obsluhy tak to bude na 5 hvězd. Takto když se musí skenovat každý kupón zvlášť, to pěkně zdržuje. Když by si to mohl naskenovat každý sám, tak bych na samoobslužné pokladny chodil více. Ideální by bylo kdyby se kupóny jen aktivovaly v aplikaci a pak by se načetli při naskenování clubcard. | slevy dobre | супер | It's buggy :( | The dog biting his tail. Useless if you cannot recover your clubcard number in the mail.I don't wanna call you for getting a number for which I don't even care .Every supermarket is having some card benefits, but how Tesco is doing it now is diabolic . Double of price difference between clubcard and not , is the food changing inside or what ? Literally double on most foods, are you selling for free the clubcard one if the not clubcard is double ? Just went out with one thing instead of 20 . | Good | for me 5 stars | Naprosto otřesná, příšerná a otravná aplikace. V telefonu jí mám, protože jinak se v Tescu nedá nakoupit za ani trochu normální ceny, ale po každém nákupu mi nad ní cuká prst vzteky. NEPOCHOPÍM proč se po 3 neúspěšných pokusech přihlásit zablokuje TESCO ÚČET. Jaké je bezpečnostní riziko u TESCO ÚČTU?! Možná, kdybyste si naprosto neospravedlnitelně nevynucovali všechny osobní údaje, tak by tam tahle stupidní featura být nemusela. Brzo jí prostě odinstaluju, do Tesca chodit přestanu a bude pokoj. | I was at the cash register, I wanted to use vouchers - I turned on the application, it wanted to update and I had no choice... | jo je to good, máte tam víc kuponu a slev než normálně. mate o všem přehled | Jsem spokojená 😌 | Updated: The issue has been resolved! Thank you! Impossible to set up an account with a new club card! I enter all of the data correctly, but keep getting the same message - ""an error has occurred""! | When I save coupons and scan CC on cash register, the coupons are not applied. The same works in Lidl | Co takhle zobrazit můj účet z nákupu v tesco v aplikaci a vysvětlit, že vaše slevy a body sedí a všechno je ok? S možností reklamace? Při posledním nákupu jsem byl při placení v pokušení vyprázdnit košík a odejít. Na pokladně totiž může na zákazníka vyskočit položka, kterou opravdu nečekal, po odečtení slev je sice částka přijatelnější, ale 100% jistotu zákazník při placení nemá. Je obtížné vybavit si všechny nápisy u regálů a rozdíl bývá docela podstatný, v mém případě 30%. | Faced errors on each step: errors to register a card, try later; later account is locked, try to reset password. Gave it up & uninstalled app. Will use other shops with normal applications: lidl, Albert, Billa | awesome | I would like to browse all products in tesco not just the ones on sales | Do tesca jsem přestal chodit, najednou žluté slevy nejsou slevy. Ale musíte mít další aplikaci, abyste dostali lepší ceny za výměnu svých osobních dat. Ne děkuji. Lidl a Albert to jistí 👍 | clubcard is very good | Thank You!🙏🏼 | Body zmizely, kupóny žádné nemám, nikde nenajdu proč. | Wonderful discounts and great shopping experience | 👍 | Kupóny se nezobrazily když jsem byl v obchodě offline i když js měl kupóny uložené. Reakce na odpověď: Nemám problém s registrací. Prosím pokud chcete reagovat na hodnocení, nejdříve si ho přečtěte. | Ujebali mi body | Ty kupóny by se nemusely skenovat po jednom. Pak je akorát pokladní naštvanej a já jsem taky naštvanej. Nějaký způsob aktivace na příští nákup by bylo mnohem lepší řešení. | no way I am rating you good when you stick the review prompt in my face | 👍 | Absolutely pitiful. Tried to scan my existing clubcard, waited 10mins to do it all over, multiple passwords created....in the end back to square one. A wonderful way to waste your time. Best of luck to all who try! | An unexpected error occured during registration for several weeks. | easy, well working | U aktualni objednavky se nezobrazuje pocet objednanych polozek a jejich cena. Proc se tam zobrazuji aktualni ceny? | I keep getting the message that an unexpected error occured when I try to register.I sent an email to the czechia team days ago but no response. | I am not able to see my detailed bills only the sum. Today I have faced the same issue. No info what I have purchased in the app. All your competitors have this info albert, billa, lidl they even have possibility not to print bill which is environmentally friendly but yours has only sum. The email on website is a joke no response since I wrote my firts review here. | Debilni kartičky na všechno. Ať jsou s tim firmy do.. | impossible to sign into the app. after entering your login details, the ""continue"" button literally just doesn't work, you can't press it. this needs a fix | Can't input my B.D. | During signing in, the app asks for club card number which is available only after sign in process in case of electronic clubcard. Seams like Tesco thinks that clubcard number is one of the most important numbers in your life... Nonsense. Edit after response: registration emails usually ends up in spam and they are deleted after certain period of time. My point is the security nonsense of the app, what is the point of authentication using email and password when you also need to store the card number. If for some reason, you need to match the security to the level of fintech apps with 2FA, at least add an option to use second verification with a text message as the sane developers do. | Not really compatible Has more issues to get back to initial registration process. Once you scan the card then you do not have an option to delete or reenter new card. Not satisfied with app's user friendliness | good | I love it. | je to fajn, hodily by se e-uctenky. | I uninstalled the app and when I reinstalled it, it wanted the ClubCard number, but I didn't remember it. Why isn't the card bound to my account? I won't screenshot it and have it unnecessarily stored in cloud. Thanks for nothing tesco :/ | voucher discounts are difficult to track | App is broken. Can't register, can't sign in. Unexpected error all around the place | If I could give you minus points, I would. It is going from bad to worse. I don't care how good your appp is, marketing sucks. Sick with getting coupons for goods out of stock in all shops for months on end or goods you never actually buy. Totally overpriced as at Jan 2022, low quality goods, especially veges, better go to Albert and Billa in Czechia. Club card discounts are veey few, if at all and discounted goods in Tesco are more expensive than the same regular priced goods at other stores. | way much better then before.. | nice application | Nefunkční adventní kalendář | I have issues with adventni calendar: the app closes when I tap to open event - I have it on Xiaomi redmi note 4, maybe it is phone issue? Can you advice what can I do? Otherwise - great app! Using it often:) | An excellent app full of rewards and discounts | It's great to see many countries listed for the app. But No English❓ | good application I love it.. | I could not even finish a registration :( | useless app, didn't manage to login and add my tesco card points | Useful | pomalé, nechybí elektronické účtenky | Statements still doesn't work | Would be nice, when I order food online it would add all my available discounts automatically. | I gave tried for months to get it to work and I find it impossible. | Super application. Many thanks to the developers for their sophistication. The application is simple, has easy operation and the advantage is that it has a Widget. Good work... | Stupid name. I look it up in the list of my apps and it is NOT at T as tescomobile. | failed to log in with newly created account which was blocked again in a few minutes after resetting password | Statements don't work at all (none load despite there being at least 5 payments I made recently) and it seems the applied coupons take a while to get marked as used, butbotherwise seems good, works fine for me. Edit regarding response: Both of those make sense, good to know. I'm giving 5 stars because neither is really a problem then; I thought statements would appear immediately. | Never works when I try to login | I never had so many problems with an app until now. Keep it. I uninstalled all 3 Tesco apps. | Created a club card oonline through the app, loggesout tried to login again , it keep asking me to scan card or enter it manually, why and how since the card is on the app | Naprosto k nicemu. Nejde se ani zaregistrovat. Jakmile se pokusim vytvorit novy ucet, rovnou to oznami ze ucet je blokovany kvuli chybnemu pokusu o prihlaseni. Nekolik pokusu o reset hesla a porad totez. Aplimace totalne k nicemu, programatorum zlamat ruce at uz radeji nic nevymysli. | The App stops work. The current version is for Android 5.0 and higher only. I have 4.4. Please create the App for lower Android version. Thanks | The app doesn't load the vouchers tab, which is the only reason i installed it for, because i don't own a printer to print them (and wanted to save paper). I'm dissapointed... | Why can't I get my clubcard now , | It's not working at all | Aplikace najednou nelze aktualizovat. | Pěkný redesign, gratuluji vývojářům. | Nelze dokoncit registraci, píše neznámá chyba | Keeps asking to rate. Not very fast | Ospravedlňujem sa, moje review patrilo k druhej tesco aplikácii :) | Nemohu používat aplikaci, pokud mám root. Co s tím ? | Skvělý vývoj, je vidět, že aplikace pokročila | It's fine now, but the support must also speak English ;) | Po aktualizaci urcite prehlednejsi. Nektere carove kody se vubec neukazuji a misto dvojnásobku bodu mi naskocila sleva 6,- Kč na cely nakup za 2500,- takze carove kody nesedi. Vidím tom max. za 3 :-/ Update listopad 2019: Slevy v kuponech nefungují vubec. Zkusil jsem 3 kupóny. Každý hlásil nějakou nesmyslnou chybu. Akorát s tím zdrzujete všechny u pokladny a všichni ve frontě včetně obsluhy kasy jsou z toho otrávený. Appka na nic. | After latest update voucher topup issue fixed, but app still crashes upon the attempt to change contact preferences I.e. email address. | Aplikace nefunguje. Napřed nešla vůbec registrace mailu. Teď s odstupem času když se chci přihlásit, tak to chce naskenovat čìslo karty, datum a příjmení, ale pak to při potvrzení píše chybu. Prostě aplikace k ničemu | Login expires in two minutes, full of unexpected errors. Whats going on? | Unexpected error dokola a dokola, neuveritelne nepouzitelna aplikacia | I try to log in back. It does not allow me. It asks again the clubcard number.. i do not know which is the clubcard number..I am not able to log in back.. :( | Its very slow | Fingerprintbaby | Good | Average | Po aktualizaci aplikace nevidim sve kupony, ktere byly videt. Vyhlasi to neocekavanou chybu. Ze ja updatoval na novou verzi a nenechal si funkcni puvodni... A nelze zmenit jazyk appky. V english telefonu to nemuzu mit cesky... EDIT: diky za odpoved. V pristi aktualizaci prosim o moznost zmeny jazyka v nastaveni. | usefull app | App by mohla být přehlednější | fair, works as i expect | Strasne.. Po kazdom update cakam, ze to zacne konecne poriadne fungovat, ale furt to pri nacitani voucheru hlasi chyby, nahodne ma to nuti zadavat PIN aj ked som ho uz x-krat zadal... Oplatilo by sa investovat do testov. Toto nie su ziadne edge cases, ale uplne najzakladnejsi flow - otvorim appku a chcem vidiet kupony... | 👍 | Love it... Easy to use, easy the scroll through... | ok | this does not work! when i try to open a coupon or voucher it gives an errror. every time! | Great app for every Tesco customer. It offers everything needed for great clubcard experience | A+ | The app is not working properly. I can't download new coupons or vouchers although I've been notified more than once that I have new coupons. Also the app only works when connected to wifi if I'm on data bundle it crashes. | App often does not load the Vouchers tab. Also, it has happened to me that the vouchers were present in the app, but at the counter I was told that they are ""too new"" and ""not in the system"" and I was not able to pay with them. | Nemůžu načíst kupóny. Nejdřív to jen dělalo dlouho načítalo a pak to vzdalo a pokaždé hlásilo, že to nejde načíst. Největší ironie asi je, že mě to otravivalo s upozorněním, že tam mam nepoužité kupóny. Celá aplikace by si ale zasloužila velký redesign. | Píše to že mám rootnutej telefon a nejde ta aplikace (telefon nemám rootnutej) | Tesco obviously needs app developers. - Session expires issue - UI poor response - UX could be better | Spolehlive nefunkcni, hlavne kdyz stojite u pokladny .. zejmena prihlaseni do aplikace. Vseobecne je k nicemu ten system - proc se kupony neuplatnuji automaticky a zdrzujete nas s jejich hledanim a obsluhu s nacitanim??? Je tu snad nekdo, kdo kupony ma a nechce je uplatnit???!!!

Club card discounts are veey few, if at all and discounted goods in Tesco are more expensive than the same regular priced goods at other stores.""]",false,false,false,"cz.tesco.clubcard","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.tesco.clubcard&hl=en&gl=CZ"

It was a pleasure. | Common, cart is not synced between devices? Please, this is the basic functionality of any shopping app, FIX that or IMPLEMENT it. | Great | Aplicatia este usor de folosit. Se poate imbunatati la selectarea categoriilor pe care sa le vizionezi. Nu este foarte intuitiva optiunea asta. | Can't order for months on this app! I always get the error ""invalid city"" thrown when trying to order, so I have to use a desktop. App useful just for wishlisting. Fix your bugs! | moda i zakupy online | Ок | Good app, easy to use | Great | My favorite app.I am a big fan.Always the nicest things,best prices, very good quality,nice colours.You can pick up from store and return it if it doesn't fit.99% measures are good.Love it.!!!!?? | Very easy and user friendly. | Easy | Cool | bez greske | Sup | Even if I ordered the products by using the app, when I wanted to make the return process, I had to do it on the web. It is quite annoying for a simple customer and also, the customer support was not so user friendly and did not want to understand the client's situation even if... SINSAY's core business consists in sales... Online or directly into the shop... Integrate your interfaces and provide some soft skills trainings to your employees to make a smoother process. | 👍 | Iubesc calitatea hainelor. | Good app, easy to find products and buy. | С приложението се работи лесно и бързо. | Kox | Great experience so far..ordered already few times without any problem | A little difficult to find something, online there are more possibilities | Convenient app | App is alright in itself, but constant updates are just unacceptable. | 1. Доставка уже почти неделю, хотя было заявлено 3/4 рабочих дня 2. Заказ на сумму больше 140 злотых и все равно доставка платная, хотя они пишут в условиях что бесплатно | It was really nice | Thank you for your professionalism! | Can't register. After registration from the site and finally sucsessfully login in the app, the app logged me in, but then forced me to agree with some policy. I try to agreed with it, but the app tells me that there is some error, nothing special. Maybe the app should show the real problem to the end user like ""The app is not working for now, we are hard working to back it."" or something simmilar. In result I wasnt able to use the discount in the my local store. Thus app is something like scam! | User friendly | Mi-ar placea sa pot filtra mai usor. Din pacate, spre exemplu, categoria de sport nu era asa vizibila. In rest am comandat usor. Chiar ma bucur sa o folosesc. | Bezpłatna dostawa do sklepu, ale ŻADEN sklep w Warszawie (!!) nie realizuje tymczasowo dostaw ze sklepu online od kilku miesięcy. Gorące pozdrowienia dla rekinów marketingu Sinsay 👏 | Nice ideas and quality best prices very fast delivery ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🙏💛 | Satisfying | Good app. Easy to do your shopping. User friendly. | I love it. | Tabelul de marimi este prost facut,si nu te poti baza pe el. | Magyar felületen lengyel oldal jelenik meg. | Voljela bih vidjeti wishlist i u online stranici, a ne samo u aplikaciji jer oboje koristim ovisno jesam li na mobitelu ili laptopu. | Great | The worst! First they have modified my delivery address, then they discovered that they don't have any item on the stock. Unreliable! | great | Szybkie i wygodne zakupy, super, że jest dostęp do składu | My partner and I order clothes from Sinsay and so do I for our 2 kids. Ratio between quality and price is great recommend the app. | Perfect | Buzeranti | Grate clothes | Nice promotions | Poor search engine | Ako se odabere preuzimanje narudžbe u poslovnici, može se odabrati samo nekoliko poslovnica, a kad naručite na adresu, GLSu ne plate uslugu i onda paket stoji danima u skladištu, ne dobijete obavijest, nego tek kad ih pitate. Paket se vrati, a novce ne vraćaju dok ne dobiju paket natrag? Jedno je kad sami tražite povrat, pa okej, ali ovako kad je greška s njihove strane...katastrofa. Podrška odgovara svaka 3 dana, UX nula bodova | It doesn't work, doesn't allow me to finish the order | Imi place mult interfata online | Ok quality, good deals! | 🤩 | Pana acum sunt multumita | Sve uredno prikazano i kupnja i povrati. Roba je ok za cijenu.. | satisfied | Very good | Wszystko super działa. Dla użytkowników są dostępne są dodatkowe promocje. 😃😃😃 | Cool | 🧨 | I love it | 👍 | Garbage. Last version full of bugs. I can't even add items to basket. | Ușor de folosit, mărimile dispar repede 😂 | E super ok si iubesc produsele!!! Recomand | Very good | Best | Удобно приложение, лесно за ориентиране и приятни отстъпки. 🌠 | Very good app. A lot of discounts and many nice things you can't find in stores. | Gret | Nice | Easy to use it | Good | ok | The app is good however I would like to only be shown men's clothing in the main menu. | 😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌 | Great app. Great deals. | App is easy to use and the interface is nice. | Overall good experience | Very good very organized thanks again 🙂 | Това е най-лошото приложение, което съм опитвала да използвам. Не мога да си попълня информацията, като се опитам да я запазя не се случва нищо, изключително бавно е. | Just as previously stated by someone else, I have had the same problem for a few months now: I cannot pay for orders placed via the app. Right at the end, after following all the necessary steps, without any difficulty, I should add, when I press pay, it gives me error. I have notified Sinsay about this. Now, let's see what they are going to do about it. And telling me to order via Google Chrome is not the solution, sorry. | Gunoi de app. Nu poti plati, se schimba preturiile cand pui in cos si merge foarte greu. | Great | Brilliant | Ati putea adauga o secțiune de review-uri. | Îmi place! | i love shopping | Discountul oferit la instalarea aplicației nu exista | Great app with great stuff in it. | Ușor de folosit, rapidă, practică | Very good | Лесно за употреба | I cant place an order , it keeps telling me to fill in my information even thou I did , over and over again! | Ok | Aplicatia asta nu e facuta cum trebuie. Cand trebuie sa platesti si ai datele de facturare si livrare deja selectate, la plata cu cardul da eroare. Nu mai laudati aplicatia asta ca adaugi in cos si nu poti plati la final. Prefer sa cumpar din browser decat din aplicatie. Nu recomand! | Самото приложение насича доста честно. Липсва детайлно меню за под-категории като в на сайта, тук са само генерални за мъже/жени/деца. Също не всичко от сайта излиза на Търсене в приложението. | Nem enged budapesti üzletet kiválasztani a boltban átvételhez... Tehát teljesen haszontalan átverés az ország nagyrésze számára | Super | Good | Probleme la plata. Desi aveam profilul pt destinatar si cel pt facturare create deja, imi tot cerea sa completez toate datele. La iesirea din cos am pierdut toate cumpărăturile. Am reusit abia dupa logare din nou sa imi adun articolele dorite in cos si sa fac tranzacția. | I cannot see the details of any of the products as it's just a black page when I click on them. | Csak arra nem alkalmas amire való (lenne) Rendelni nem lehet. | De calitate produsele | Totul foarte clar si usor de utilizat. Nu am intampinat nici un fel de probleme pana acum. | Ok | Some time the app just stop working | There is no English version | Sizes and quality meet expectations! 👏🏻 | Excelent | A bit of lag, but I am glad I have the app and I have to use the browser to pay with a card :))) | The app crashes on start, very very dab app | The app is crashing over and over again. I wasn't able to place the order and I gave up. | Katastrofa Sorry ale spíš vůbec nic, než takhle nedodělaná appka.. Upd: 0 reakce | Aplicatia abia se incarca, stai si astepti o gramada dupa ce selectezi optiunile tale. Daca ai treaba si revii dupa sa mai cauti ceva se reseteaza tot. O pierdere de timp. Plus ca la ultima comanda produsele mi-au venit cu defecte si rupte. | este aplicatia mea favorita pentru shopping! toate produsele sunt extrem de minunate! 💕💕💕 | The app works amazing. Very easy to use. | Super totul | Works well for me | ok | Easy to use. | The worst shopping experience ever. Hire proffesional who can create a decent app. Hire some QAs to test it! It crashes in all kinds of places. It's embarrassing! | Ok | Unable to pay via app! Easy product search and overall navigation through the app but I cannot seem to be able to pay for my orders via the app. Both Google Pay an credit card options fail and I need to revert to the website to finalize the process. Is there a setting I am missing? I am using an android phone, no similar issues with other online shopping apps | Awesome! | This appos the drim! | Good | Najnowsza wersja zawiera poprawki? W którą stronę?Nie dość, że ciągle wyrzuca mnie z apki, najczęściej podczas wybierania rozmiaru danej rzeczy z poziomu listy ulubionych czy wybieraniu paczkomatu lub punktu odbioru. Przez to mnóstwo razy ktoś podkupił mi rzeczy, które ciągle sprawdzałam czy są dostępne. Na dodatek nie da się znaleźć paczkomatu lub sklepu gdy wpisuje miejscowość, nie wyszukuje mi jej. Jedyne, co mogę zrobić, to szukać jej na mapie całej Polski,przybliżając w orientacyjne miejsce | On the website I use Facebook login, in the app I don't have an option to use FB login to use the same account... and the user and pass does not work in normal login... | I cannot be used for more then 5 minutes. This app is bed | Super ok | Awesome 👍👍👍👍 | Prefer magazinul online. Aplicatia este buguita. Nu imi arata produsele si nu are o baza de date comuna cu websiteul asa ca ma spameaza dublu cu emailuri. | It worked smooth until couple of weeks ago. Now I can't even use the app anymore, since the products pages don't load completely and cannot see the respective pictures and details/sizes. Reloading page doesn't help. It's just very frustrating. Am I the only one who's experiencing this issue? What is the fix for it? | I have an account created with Facebook on the web version, but the app does not have the option to login with Facebook so I can't use my existent account and I don't want to create another one! Please fix this. I am uninstalling until then... | Very good app 😍🙂I love there's an option to search for a product's label | Works great . | Nice app for kids clothes | Sinsay has great clothing collections and I have ordered multiple times until now that the web version doesn't work properly, it is such a hassle to even login. And the app cannot be translated to English, it is not easy to navigate when you don't understand the language. Looking forward to new language features. | The app is closing by it self | Excelenta! | I downloaded the app and all was ok until payment - I could not pay online or place the order with payment on delivery either because I kept getting the same message: ""sorry, there was an error"". So I had to place the order again on my computer. The app seems useless for now. | Cannot order from the app. Error at the last step. It works on the website. Nu se poate comanda din aplicatie. Apare eroare la ultimul pas. Functioneaza de pe site. | very slow, throws random errors (like a connection error when I typed a wrong password and the same error when I typed the right password) | The App looks good but then again how do I use it when I do not understand the language. Because you live in a country doesn't mean you speak their language. My point is that there should be somewhere on that App where one can change the language irrespective of the country | Nu se poate finaliza plata. Am incercat conturi diferite,dispozitive diferite, plata cu card,google pay,plata la livrare si tot fara rost. Am incercat si de pe site dar cu acelasi rezultat. Dupa 24 ore am reusit sa platesc cu Google Pay (Am aplicatia instalata). In continuare nu se poate alege plata cu card.Nu apare nici o eroare ,doar te intoarce la pagina finalizare comanda. La fel si de pe alt tel mobil (I phone 13). | Should be in English as well ! Not everyone understand the local language! | The app is moving very,very slowly. I always have to wait a few seconds when I click on something before it appears | Unfortunately the app is not working,I keep getting the same message that there is a connection problem, even though my internet connection is a very good one. | Nu pot plasa comenzi in aplicație. Când dau la finalizare îmi arată a apărut o eroare. | Aplicatia da eroare la finalizarea comenzii | Ff bun | Nu pot finaliza comanda, orice metoda de plata selectata apare mesajul "" a aparut o eroare"" | Nu a fost posibila o comanda normala, acasa (transportul fiind gratuit pentru comanda pe care am depus-o), iar eroarea a fost foarte vaga: 'a aparut o eroare'. Cand am incercat cu ridicare personala dintr-un mall, dintr-o data a mers. Un bug urat ce trebuie fixat. | Apare eroare la comanda... | Very good app | So far so good! | Very nice application ☺️ I like it 👍 it sometimes takes way longer to load specific sections of the app but otherwise I'm impressed. | Happy to have it. Nice, well organized, comprehensible, easy to control . | Merge mai bine ca site ul | Easy to use. | Usor de folosit plus preturi speciale in aplicatie :) | Finally the app is here!! Is more easier to navigate/search/shop and place an order than on the website. Works fine (04.01.23), no bugs, no errors and I managed to place an order. As a suggestion maybe would be less annoying and more easier if the ""Mama/mommy"" clothes category is in a separate area and not mixed up with the women's category. | Nice app | Merge bine. | Foarte buna aplicatia, insa la retur te trimite sa faci retur numai in magazin. Nu e aceiasi procedura ca pe site. ( Desi din ce am citit la termeni si conditii, varianta de retur gratis se va scoate din 2023, si poate acesta e motivul pentru care nu a fost adaugat in app ) | Dark theme va rog | Easy to use | 💙it | Super | Sometimes is moving slowly and removes me from application causing a black screen..but I enjoy it more than the browser. Keep up on improving it because it will pay off to customers. | Pretty good experience. | I tried over an hour to place an order and didn't succed. I kept getting the error ""Prefixul nu este valid"", but it didn't mention what prefix and even after I tried modifying every input, I still got the error. I didn't even get to the step for entering card details. Awful experience! | Awful app. When I wanted to place the order it kept giving me the same error about the street/apartment number and it was impossible to finish ordering. So disappointing. | Foarte buna aplicatia | Excelent. Preturi mici cu reduceri dese. Mai fsin ca H&M | Bardzo fajna aplikacja, miło się z niej korzysta | Często się zawiesza, nie odpisują na zapytania. Ale ogólnie ok | Rapid, ușor de utilizat :) | Finally an app for sinsay, it works very good, no problems | Always has an error when I want to place an order. | Ador ❤️ | Very intuitive and fluid application! Super 👍 | Good app so far. No problem has been encountered | Great app, great products. | Checkout-ul e varză rau....prea multe cerințe si obligativitatea de cont... | 👍👍👍 | I've been shopping from Sinsay for probably 8 years, happy to finally have an app also. ❤️ | I couldn't place the order because there was an error regarding the payment (I chose online payment with the card) but I didn't even get to the point where it would add card details and process the payment. | Super mulțumită! Recomand în special părinților. | Foarte bună, și pe site și pe aplicație | Super | Very happy to have a sinsay app finally :) | Finally a Sinsay App I was waiting for ages | I couldn't place my order in the app because I had a constant error at the Street field. And their consultants were of absolutely no help. I have wasted 1 hour with them and 2 hrs total and all I have is frustration, anger and disappointment. Plus, on the website, the home delivery service is charged while in the app is for free. | Super zakupy polecam | Excelent","{""1"":627,""2"":0,""3"":627,""4"":4854,""5"":35701}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","LPP S.A.

Review 04.02.2023: Seit dem letzten Update deutlich schneller! Danke Entwicklerteam! Review 17.03.2024: Die App ist zwischenzeitig wieder gtottenlahm geworden 😐 | Here in Serbia, you don't get any perks for having the app. A cashier won't even scan because their system is not connected with the app. Im Serbien sind wir kein Mensch? | хора, толкова ви е бъгаво приложението, че на логин още умира... оправете го първо, после го качвайте... | Cannot see any products in the Products tab. | Very beautiful app. I have my shopping under control. | No Romanian version, why? | Some of the products don't appear in the purchase history, therefore I cannot collect points for buying them. | Sehr gut | Sjajni DM | Dobar | All I ever wanted is an ""Activate all"" button for the cupons. I hate activating 30 one by one. | Hallo, application is excellent, BUT, I wonder why I don't have any coupon in application in Serbia. Never?. | Adorr | The best Thing in my opinion about dm is that you can easily check if your desired items are in stock. Everything about dm is costumerfriendly. | The old app has been phased out without a single notification. I had to create new account, so I lost my previous points (edit: I have the points but need to further steps and find the menu point to do it on the main screen... This should be part of the workflow when I create new account if you don't want to maintain an old one...). When I was registered to the app, my brand new password was not matching, so I had to request a new immediately... | Ova aplikacija je beskorisna, sve ima na sajtu. Srpski menadžeri neće da se potrude i osmisle nešto u Srbiji, za razliku od hrvacke i ostalih zemalja gde aplikacija ima smisla. | Muller ima tole bolj enostavno. Tukaj pa dodatno prodajalka naredi kartico, pa zadeva ne deluje. Vpisovala naslov tudi na njenem telefonu in javlja napako. Ne razumem zakaj toliko kompliciranja. Naložite si Mullerjo aplikacijo in deluje simpl. Že prej s tistimi ""bankomati"" ni šlo vse kot je treba. Unistalled | sehr gut | amazin | Odlična usluga, kvalitet extra. | Aplikaciji nedostaju filteri po preferencijama tipa Vegan, organic. Takodje imam problem da dobijam error kada pokušam da napravim korpu gde dobijam poruku da su neke cene promenjene i da proverim sadržaj korpe. Pritom app ne nudi rešenje. Morala sam da obrišem celu korpu i ponovo ubacim čitav sadržaj. Dodatno, app radi sporo kada se artikli izbacuju iz korpe ili kada se ubacuju iz wish liste. | Bugggzzz, tokom instaliranja, poslije tri ponovnog pokretanja, app. stabilan | Najzad. A tako dugo sam s epitala zašto nemaju app. Ravim | Yet another App that fails to recognise people don't necessarily speak the language of the country in which they live or work ...DOES NOT SUPPORT ENGLISH | I don't know why you developed this, just to show us it does not work. Each time I am in a store, the QR code cannot be scanned because their system is not functional. | Great | Aplikacija za srpsko tržište je beskorisna... Ne pruža nikakve pogodnosti, lojaliti ne postoji. 👎 | This is total spyware! | Too many updates, whenever I want to use the app in the shop it always asks for some update and you can't use your loyalty card without updating. This is really annoying because even if I update it, I have to log in again. It takes too much time which you don't have when you're at the paydesk. | Are all 253 updates every year really necessary...!? Almost every time when opening the app at the cash desk to show a QR and collect the points, the app needs an update. This has become really, really annoying to the point of unusability! Not worth the effort... 🙄 | Fali dark mode | Ovoj aplikaciji fali jednostavnost. Payback mi je bila bolja. Jedina prednost je webshop. | Absolutely bad tested application. First of all you can't log in on Xiaomi phone if you default browser is Google chrome. When you log in in mii browser and try to bind a loyalty card and forgot the pin you can't change it - error message tells that all fields have to be filled but they are already filled. Next, when I change pin why should I fill in my birthdate, post code and fill in again the whole card number? Please hire someone who can make applications. | 1. In den Coupons gibt es leider keine Direktlinks zu den betroffenen Produkten, sodass man diese erst über die Suche finden muss. Das macht die Konkurrenz schon lange. 2. Neuerdings werden nicht mehr die zuerst ablaufenden Coupons verwendet, falls man mehrere fast identische (abgesehen vom Ablaufdatum) hat. Sehr ärgerlich. 3. Bereits aktivierte Coupons kann man nicht mehr deaktivieren. Spontane Einkäufe mache ich bei der Konkurrenz, damit mir der jeweilige Coupon für den Großeinkauf bleibt. | Sehr gut | Its nice app.But,i cant find active beauty,and i didnt get any cupons,only first when i install the app. | All good | tooop | bad very bad 👎 it takes too long and it doesn't work | Super | Влизам в личния си профил, пиша ревю, всеки път трябва да пиша псевдоним, полето е задължително и никога не мога да си напиша името, защото ""вече е заето""?? Естествено, че е заето, нали това съм аз! Що за глупост?? | No English version | Checkout does not work. The user can only see the following message:""We are sorry... Unfortunately, this page does not exist."". I have installed the latest app version. This functionality was working fine before. | top | I like to shop there | Great 👍 | It's annoying that I need to sign in EVERY TIME I want to use the app. I think there are not too many coupons | Pola stvari skoro nikad nije dostupno online. Ne odgovaraju na poruke. | Super | super | Functioneaza super ok. | Can you please make the app available in English? I live in Hungary and It would be nice to have it available in english too! | sometimes app doesn't work | 1. Koliko vidim aplikacija nema opciju ""Preuzmi u radnji"". 2. Naravno, 15% na prvu kupovinu se odnosi SAMO na ONLINE prvu kupovinu ali to nigde nije naglašeno. 3. Čudno je da je ovako jaka firma tek sada uvela ovakvu vrstu aplikacije kada je i mnogo lošije firme imaju već nekoliko godina... ili je u pitanju odnos prema potrošačima u Srbiji... | Aplikacija je super, paket je spakovan fenomenalno, sve je zasticeno maksimalno, sve pohvale🥰 | odlična lagana sve vidčjivo | I ordered for the first time through the application, in order to receive a 15% discount for the first purchase. As the items broke during delivery, they refunded my money within 4 days. I asked them to deliver the products to me, but not to return the money, they said they couldn't do that. Yes, I also lost the 15% discount, as if I had received the products. I have ordered the products I really enjoy to use so my disappointment was huge. Customer care failed completely. #dmSerbia | Loveee | Am very much interested please for us to do business with DM company | I'd like to see my purchase receipts in digital form. There's no such option in the app or at least I couldn't find it. | Where can I see my points? I don't have my points which I gathered for 10 years. I just cut these useless card. Goodbye. Hello rossmann | No english language | Odlično! | Katastrofa!!! Poradite malo na marketingu, ako želite da poklonite nešto potrošaču za online kupovinu, neka to budu pravi popusti ili besplatna dostava za bilo koji iznos kupovine. Razočarenje. P. S. Danas je broj 26 prazan, piše da je već bio otvoren.... | Worst application ever. You can't buy anything because they say it is not available when you go to checkout but you are able to add it to cart. | It's niceeeeeee | best. | The application helps in sorting out new products, discounts and shops in which you can find the last, remaining items. It is also rewarding because you can pay your shopping with the collected points. | Great store, great products and prices, great application | The app is good but EVERYTHING else is a NIGHTMARE.In app it writes that delivery is 2-3 working days,I made order 30.11.2023,after 5 days it comes messeage that order it will be delivered,unfortunately I was not available to accept the order from DPD.I reorder the delivery date to another day 12.12.2023,DPD support say that order is not ready that day and it goes tommorow 13.12.2023,the same package is not delivered on time 3 times in a row. Horrible delivery experience here in Croatia. | There is no English language. How are we supposed to understand the app? The developer forgot that there are other nationalities who would like to use the app. | I love DM because the prices are good and I can order online so fast and easy, either with delivery at home or for pickup in a shop. I'm already buying most of the stuff I need from here because it's just cheaper than in other places and also Bio quality. I just hope they increase their assortment of goods so I can get everything here. If they keep their prices lower than other providers, I'm definitely staying their client for life. | Velmi dobre | hilft | perfect 💖💞💖💦 | Had to spend 10 minutes getting a new QR code in the app (apparently they expire after a while) but it worked perfectly a week prior. Constantly getting errors and of course I couldn't get my points either for a bigger purchase I had. Would not recommend this app unless you have ample time on your hands. | Funktioniert sehr gut! Много добро приложение! | Very unfriendly, very and unnecessary complicated integration with dm active beauty account | Uzas uzas i uzas, porudzbinu cekate po 10 dana ali to nije do aplikacije... Ukoliko Vam nesto tteba hitno ne narucivati! | With update not possible to log in again, bonus points lost | The app is decent but everything else is not. The package packed by DM was horrible. They just showed stuff together, pet food&hygiene on top of each other. Liquid soap bursted and soaked half of the stuff. I've spent over an hour cleaning my hallway from the mess and their customer service says ""just pack it good and return it"" 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ horrible service and experience, never buying over app with them! | Ich liebs vorallem die Coupons sind einfach super | It's such an excellent app! So easy to use and have all the info within few clicks. Bravo!!! | gooda gooda là same same but different mr là! | Gute App | es wäre super wenn man die Coupons nutzen könnte ohne sich zu registrieren | Useless - given that DM requires also ownership of plastic card | sehr gut | Very interesting and useful app, especially concerning information related to products and stores where to purchase them | Brilliant best way to save a lot of money❤️ | Magic | top | app not available in French on English | The app is great, even better now than it was in the beginning. You can see purchase history, get occasional discounts, now there's even a live series featuring influencers and public personalities (for Romania at least) | ist eine ziemlich gute App. nicht immer übersichtliche aber informative | I can t even install it, it charges for an hour | Super | Nainstaloval jsem, registroval, ukazal QR kod u pokladny. Jenom aby mi pani rekla, ze to v obchode nefunguje a potrebuju plastovou kartu. Mam si ji pry sparovat s aplikaci. Akorat ze sparovat to nikde nejde. Takze jako co? DM Praha Strasnice dnes. | Leider wird mittlerweile erwartet ein Payback Konto zu hinterlassen, um die Coupons nutzen zu können. Dadurch wird die App für mich allerdings nutzlos, da ich kein Payback Kunde bin | Very good app. It would be even better if we had the option of deactivating coupons when needed. Thanks | За съжаление поръчката ми дойде с липсващи продукти, а на оплакването ми не получих отговор | sehr gut | Good very good | Predobra app, mnogo mi se svida | Gute | Worst app I ever seen | Ocajno napravljeno. Cekas paket dugo i kad konacno dobijes obavestenje da ce danas stici paket i pise navodno koliko sati uopste nije tako. Ne znas ukoliko sati ce doci!! I onda kad se desi da se slucajno nejavis na telefon oni ne zele opet dolaziti nazad vec sutra dan. I sad ti sutra treba da cekas ceo dan sa telefonom u ruci ko budala ne znajuci u koliko sati ce doci!! Napravite redovno tu sugavu aplikaciju stavite pratnju preko putem Gps !! Ali da ovo je Srbija vi to nikada necete imati! .!. | Dobra aplikacija. Lako i jednostavno bez bagova, lagova. Pozitivno iskustvo i preporuke! | so many bugs | Captcha goes on forever till I die when I try to sign in | poor filters. | I would appreciate if it was possible to skip update for later as I just needed the clerk scan my card at the checkout. | 💖 | Ne da se povezati z Payback aplikacijo. | Много съм разочарована! Още първата ми поръчка беше объркана. Няма да използвам повече. | This is such a nice app! I actually love buying products from DM and using their app. Also,if you don't wanna wait too long you can actually pick up your products at the DM store! Only negative thing is that the limiteds are not available later,but eitherway,it's a good app! I recommend this app for DM lovers! Yours truly,hcney. | 👍 | 👍 | Does have unusable functions. | 👌👌👌👌 | velmi dobra appka ! | Pécsen a szolgáltatás kiszállítás miatt hasznàlhatatlan. Négy napja kaptam értesítést, hogy aznap kiszàllítjàk a csomagot, azóta vàrom. A futàr (Sprinter) egyszer volt hajlandó felvenni a telefont, azt igérte este 6-ig kiszàllítja, ez két napja volt, azóta nem lehet elérni. Pelenkàt, popsitörlőt, babatermékeket akartam rendelni, hogy ne kelljen a gyerekkel mennem a boltba. Mindenből kifogytam, a csomag nem jött. Elmegyek a Rossmanba és törlöm az alkalmazást. | It would be nice if I had a chance to put together a shopping list, and check everything when I buy it. I think it would be a nice feature. | Complicated and not user frendly | ❤️ | I used ""ridicare express"" - before, and I could pay with cash, when, I went after my already packaged goods - from your store. - since, your application has benefits like 15% off - At my chosen store, they cannot read my loyalty card-they couldn't from the start, since they can't use the reader of said QR code - numar client. How am I supposed to get the products you sell, if I get cash into my hands every month, and I used to be able to use said money? Are you above that I should get 15% off? | Perfect | Super zadovoljna. | Unreliable, useless app. Keeps logging me out, forgets the connected physical card. The worst shopping app I ever tried. | Sehr gute Deals! | Ich bin zufrieden | It keeps logging out... | Nisam dobio aktivacioni mejl ni posle nedelju dana pokušavanja da mi se ponovo pošalje, čak sam i slao mejl direktno dm-u !?! Didn't get the activation mail, even after 1 week of trying to resend one, I even sent mail directly to dm Srbija !?! | Nepregledna i komplicirana aplikacija. | Doresc de 2 luni sa fac o comanda mare online.As beneficia de livrare gratuita si de voucherul online de 15 la suta. Cred ca nu mai cumpar ever de la DM. Va bateti joc de oameni. Jumatate din produsele din lista pentru comanda lipsesc de pe stoc. Cand lipsesc unele,cand altele. Si majoritatea sunt marci DM, deci nu se poate da vina pe alti furnizori. Mereu nu sunt produsele. Ce mai puneti livrare online daca aveti in depozite 3 lulele 3 surcele mereu? Halal fidelitate! Vrea omul, dar nu are ce. | The payment didn't go through twice in the row, items that I've ordered stayed in the basket. It worked in the browser afterwards. | sometimes to allow it the cart has many items | App not working properly, it kept kicking me out every time I wanted to proceed with payment. Their customer service is extremely slow in responding to emails. After 10 days I received a generic email from them saying they have forwarded my request to the relevant department. | Too many push notifications, which cannot be turned off. Also if I want to go into my account details, it opens a link. If I want to check on notification subscription, it opens a link. There is soooooo much room to develop. | Polite and helpful štafeta | Super und sehr praktisch | Very nice | Ich liebe diese App so sehr. Die App hilft mir jedes Mal Rabatte zu haben und es ist einfach so gut das gefühlt für jedes Produkt einen Rabatt gibt. Ich kann es sehr empfehlen für DM Liebhaber! | Einfach zu benutzen | Good app and UI. Really helpful | Schlecht. Mann darf entweder dm app nutzen oder payback. Das macht keinen Sinn. Lieber lösche ich die App und habe mehr speicher auf meinem Handy | 🍀👍 | sehr gute Produkte. immer wieder | sehr gut | not User friendly at all | I love it. | Usdt | Dugo se cekalo DM da napravi aplikaciju za online kupovinu, ali je zaista nadmasila ocekivanja, odlicna❣️ | sehr gut | love this! | Ne prodaju medicinska sredstva (npr flastere), pretpostavljam da je ih je mrzelo da prolaze kroz proceduru za dozvole. Ako zbog jedne stvari moram da odem u radnju, onda ću da kupim i sve ostalo, a aplikacija postaje potpuno beskorisna. | Seher gut 👍 👍 | Ако имаше повече купони и или някакви награди за качени суми като в ludl plus щеше да е 5 | Ich weiß nicht, ob ich es bin, aber die App ist etwas verwirrend zu bedienen und alles ist ein bisschen verstreut, wenn ich die Verkäufe für die Woche sehen möchte, kann ich sie anscheinend nicht finden. Vielleicht weiß ich nicht, wie ich es benutzen soll 🤣 Ich habe meine kaputt gemacht. 🤣 Die App sieht gut aus. | Having the version in English will be nice | Just to let you | Es werden einem nur diese Optionen angeboten: 5 Sterne geben (mit Link zum Appstore) oder Feedback geben (Link zu einer E-Mail). Das ist manipulativ und führt für mich automatisch zum Sterneabzug. Man kann bei dieser App nicht mal auswählen, welche Benachrichtigungen man will - bspw. nur solche zu Einkäufen und Lieferungen. Stattdessen wird man mit Werbung bombardiert. | Viele Produkte sind in der App nicht vorhanden. Preise online und im Landen sind anders bei online Bestellung muss man den teureren Preis bezahlen. Einiges guten sind die gratis Produkte im moment. | not generic to all account | Love it ♥️ | Može to i bolje | Google login? User chosen language? Never heard yeah? | Gut | Would be nice if I could see my purchase history somewhere, a sort of digital receipts or some such, so I could actually keep track of what I bought and when. Literal pictures of what gets printed at the cash register would be fine, I'm not sure why this needs to be pointed out, it seems pretty common sense to me. Also, more intuitive management of points per account (including companion cards!), without websites and redirects, please.... | Sjajna aplikacija | This is the best app ever 🩷 | 😍 | Perfect | When the application is available for Serbia, I will change the rating, enable it for our country as well! | Aranyos, mindig vannak akciók, lehet spórolni egy csomót :) | Musel som sa registrovať do dvoch účtov z nejakého dôvodu. A pri pokladni okrem oskenovaného QR kódu som mal ešte zadať aj nejaký pin kód. | Ich werde nervigerweise ausgeloggt. Zu oft. Keine Lust jedes Mal an der Kasse dann alles wieder einzugeben... | Ordered goods 13 days ago, still haven't received them! It's a disgrase to offer 15% discount for online shopping, and a free delivery over a certain amount, and when a customer orders, you simply do not deliver. Such a huge company, but so shameless. | Fantastično | Veoma zadovoljna isporukama,pažljivim pakiranjem i povoljnosti sa prikupljanjem bodova preko on-line trgovine | Recomand | Hier bin ich Stammkunde für alles rund um die Kinder und den Haushalt. Ich arbeite immer meine Merkliste ab und bestelle auf Vorrat. Einzig nervt es mich, dass oft Produkte online ausverkauft sind. Ansonsten tolle App, vor allem wenn man keinen dm-Shop in der Nähe hat. | Sjajna aplikacija,intuitivna i laka za rukovanje. ❤️ | Onog momenta kad je izasla aplikacija ja sam je instalirala i od tad porucujem online 2-3 puta mesecno. Opcija ""Vec kupljeno"" olaksava svaku sledecu kupovinu, a ""lista zelja"" koristim kako bih planirala unapred kupovinu. Takodje, dopada mi se opcija sto mogu da proverim stanje proizvoda u prodavnicama. Imam par DM-a u okolini, nekad nesto ima u jednoj a nema u drugoj pa mi znaci da znam ka kojoj da se uputim 😊 Sve u svemu, koristim cesto i prezadovoljna sam. | What an useless app, it doesn't even allow me to sign in, always crashes or does nothing...so how am I supposed to use my benefits? Just wow, do something about those bugs! | Уеб сайта е много по-добър от приложението. ""Mein dm"" само бъгва и когато искаш да махнеш нещо от количката, трябва да чакаш поне 30/40 секунди. Което е отвратително, когато искаш да изтриеш няколко неща. Щеше да е прекрасно ако имаше черна тема, бялото ми блести в душата! | I cant seem to find my dm points in the app, I only see my card and my name on it | Dear, Application itself is well designed,but it would certainly be nice to display how many points we have collected. | I like to much | DM ist einfach großartig und die Qualität ist super hier! Die App bringt mir Freude | Na mapi u aplikaciji ima granica izmedju Kosova i Srbije. | Enough is enough! I am sick of installing apps to buy stuff. Even more annoying are the constant updates! Furthermore, the app itself is rubbish; slow and buggy. | The shopping itself is great but the app is absolutely horrible. Crashes after a few minutes every time I use it, sometimes just freezes and everything looses function, etc. Please fix this. | Totalno neprakticna i zbunjujuca, nisam mogla povezati racun, sad ne vidi bodove | Svaki put prilikom instaliranja nekih vasih aplikacija problem. Svaki put moram mjenjati lozinku ,normalno koristim za sve ostalo samo za DM nije ispravno. Uzas! | Bad app | Fizetésnél vagy frissít vagy kijelentkezik. | Die Montag App! Forgots my login every now and then. So, with 5 people behind me in the queue I should be checking the password in my password manager? For points? No, thank you. Also, one has to be Sherlock Holmes to find out the current number of points (My dm -> dm Active Beauty).","{""1"":1843,""2"":1298,""3"":2031,""4"":11306,""5"":170702}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","dm-drogerie markt GmbH + Co.

From books to grocery to medicine and even on little torn barcode. If you can't find thing on product search go for web search well if you can read and know how to use app. 4 stars because for some plastic wrapped things it shows boxed ones. Great app keep it up. Beep is little annoying but thanks to developer you can turn it off and for ads its not annoying just takes some unused space."",""I was scammed by the advert that came with the reader when I used it. I thought that I was being asked to create an account with the restaurant in which I was ordering a meal. I paid £1 deposit.

Still haven't got my money back."",""For me, this app has been a great help!

None of them work well.Didnt give the information after scanning the code.. I gave up on scanner apps.. I needed to find another scanner app so I could link my cell to my laptop computer.I thought here we go again. Another scanner app.. I scanned the barcode on the computer.I was amazed it instantly linked my cell onto the laptop. Awesome, ser-friendly. Deserves 5 stars and more."",""BEWARE As others have said the app leads to adverts initially not the intended location and in my case something called ffitbill tried to take £60 out of my account without authorisation. Luckily my bank flagged the transaction as suspicious and suspended my card. I have since had other communications via email about a free trial and monthly subscriptions luckily also stopped. Beware this app may leed to fraudulent access to your bank or credit cards. I recommend not to use this app.""]",false,false,false,"com.gamma.scan","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamma.scan&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Rozumím že každý nemá skvělý zrak, ale kdyby to šlo nastavit, tak by to bylo super. Jinak třeba v Nepálu se podle těchto map dalo chodit bez problemu. Takže skvělé. | Excelente | Whats gone wrong? Maps will no longer show correctly since last update. | Excellent navigation app. Its getting better and better ! I love the GUI, it is designed as I would make it and its even better. Gongratulations to the app team 👌 | Great map & navigating app | no street view | Version 9.46.0 keeps GPS permanently on and drains battery. | We have used this app for hiking in the mountains, mostly in the Canary Islands. It has been excellent and allowed us to experience and plan so much more with greater confidence. Gareth D. UK | The best maps out there, and they are free. I've had a few hiccups whilst out cycling. The voice navigation sometimes tells me to take the first right. When I do,it asks me to turn back. I will one day figure out why it does that, and post it here. In the meantime it's still an exceedingly good application. | I rate it 3* because of the potential the app has. The maps are decent, the offline works, I like most the altitude and the weather factor in route estimation. Lots of good things about the app but the registration process is terrible and I gave up registering. They require an SMS to be sent to an international number, which is blocked by many North American carriers. The app developers either don't know this or they don't care, otherwise they would remove the SMS registration immediately. | The best maps I've ever used! Love to cycling with this app. | Good and it's free! I will give 5 stars if have all the gravel bike trails, bike lanes, and more options of how to custom bike routes such as easy ride and avoid busy traffic roads. Plus need to have more options of choosing different types of bicycle such as gravel, touring, etc. It will be really nice and to use when planning routes just be able to draw right on the road not Markers. Please add this features in future updates thank you! Kudos to the developers, you are awesome! Thank you!👍🏼 | Great app for navigation, unfortunately it now appears to be impossible to be able to create an account due to sms verification failure!! | Lately it's slow and constantly falling down, almost every time I open it. It's impossible to use it and rely on it! It's impossible to plan a long distance trail, crashes down constantly. Nothing what it used to be. | The best app-map for any kind of travelling, especially outdoors. Unmatched level of detail and reliability+ offline maps function. | Best, has everything | Wonderful to have all the footpaths in the whole of Europe at my fingertips. Used it extensively in Spain and found it very useful. | Excellent app for navigation but let down by the terrible cartography (change map options). Eg on the outdoor map footpaths are hard to distinguish from roads at high zoom. While for towns the Openstreetmap default is far more useful. | Works well. Offline mode is very useful | Great so far but impossible to set up account | Best map ever, so easy to read, like in 2 seconds you can see main roads, sight seeing things, shops... just love this map. And so good for hiking, walking around and cycling. | Best tourist app out there! Most comprehensive information on existing marked and unmarked hiking & biking trails I have seen anywhere. | Great app! Has maps everywhere, including Nepal, Europe and more (I guess) which is amazing! The only place I feel for improvement is in signing up and signing i ln, good work | The maps are accurate and up to date, app works fast. I love it. | Very easy to use and download maps | Aplikace je fajn. Graficky asi nejlepsi, ale ovladani je tak 5-10 let zpet, chaoticky se zobrazuji a skryvaji funkce,POIky se nedaji importovat a tezko se s nimi funguje v mape.Offline mapy v cizine jsou schopny vyzrat datovy tarif, chybi vypnuti dat WTF? | best maps of all | Never saw a registration process that requires the user to send an SMS to a number in a different country. Unable to create an account because of that. Uninstalling. | Very accurate for Camino | First time using it and very impressed. Hesitated giving5 stars as the altitude/ascent is way out after a few days hiking, but that could be due to offline mode. But what makes up for that s when you pause tracking and even close the app it always resumes. A lot of other mapping apps do not. | V rámci Česka rozhodně přesnější, než např. Google Mapy | The best | Good app for routes. Only show more time than it's needed for routes. But other is great. | OSM and fast UI. That's all I need. | Easy and best Map for Europe...👍 | Excelent | Od kilku lat korzystam z mapy.cz i jestem bardzo zadowolony. Częste aktualizacje, dokładne dane, świetna nawigacja offline. POLECAM | Best map application for Czechia, period. | Used to be better. Now on Android 12 not updating my points correctly, have to reinstall the app periodicaly. And to verify the account you almost need to be a brother of the app developer, lol. | It just works, if tou ever go to Czechia download this. It works best for Czechia and you get all the info you need. 10/10 | It won't even open after last update. Pls fix. | Perfect map app. | Tmavý režim prosím! | Great maps of hiking trails in Croatia and Slovenia. Offline maps very useful option. | My go to for all map related things! | The best offline app | The maps are great to look at, and it's free, but after using mapy, I have realized that there are a lot issues with it. Issues as follows: -There is no live traffic when using it for driving in the UK. -Difficult to search for places unless you know the full address. -There is no hill shading when using it offline for hiking. -Difficult to use the route planner -Cannot show all planned routes on the map simultaneously. I have returned to using Locus maps for hiking & Google maps for driving. | Amazing routing for hiking | Muy buena app. Los mapas tienen muy buena calidad, y tienen bastante detalle. Me parece muy útil la representación con colores de las pendientes de las montañas | Excellent sat navigation, thank you. | Skvělá aplikace, ale opravdu nejsem rád, že mě Mapy nutí k vyhození mého skvělého, ne levného telefonu a pořizování nového jen proto, že přestaly fungovat na Androidu 7. A protože kapesní telefony, jako mám teď (Xperia Z5 Compact) už se nevyrábí, je zřejmě čas, podívat se po jiných mapách. | Very accurate maps. Love the app! | Excellent, simple, quick and has all you really need | I am using the app on every biking trip. It's very detailed. I can find almost every path. | Beautiful interface, but the registration was a mess. The app and map layout is great. | The application request to send a paid SMS to register an account with them. How much will cost ? 1$? 100$? 1000$? What's the point ? There are plenty of FREE navigation apps where you can register with google account but no, Mapy request you to register with phone number sending a paid SMS. No thank! | All es gut | It's very helpful in navigating no matter where you are. | Great map, fast and simple user interface. The drawback is that, offline without internet connection, it is not possible to save a waypoint, record a track, import a track. Update: The biggest drawback is that the hillshade is not available offline. This is the main reason I do not use Mapy.cz much anymore. | Much frustrating experience . The map is good, the registration process terribly awkward, lackluster, whatever you like to name it.... getting lots of error messages on the way, and need to start all the process again every time. You also need to SEND a SMS to them for verifying your phone number, and there is no way to bookmark waypoints on the map without registering first. Online support is only in Czech. I gave up! | Excellent help when walking new routes. | Detailed flexible | Is ""create new account"" ever working? | Excellent app with clear maps with great detail in my area | I have just started using this map in Madeira and the walking maps and small pathways in towns etc are far superior than Google maps. | Best ski maps for europe countries | Great app really useful in remote areas (with downloaded) have used it throughout outback Australia and in Western Nepal. | I really like the look of these maps and the fact you can download them and also into SD card. Best map app. Bike navigation somewhat good but needs optimization or more options | Excellent maps clear view, great offline and off road | By far the best map app not only in Czechia. It's a bit of a shame that more people around the world don't use it to add photos and reviews in other countries. | great app | p.o.s. | Amazing 😍 | Great app | Good for hiking navigation | Everything is fine, but I can't make an account. They say that I have to send SMS message to THEM to verify my phone number. I'm not so dumb to fall for this and loose money lol | I do long-distance walking across countries in Europe and this app is perfect for finding and following the best route - I use the walking and tourist mode which shows the best routes avoiding roads. | Wish to share geo coordinate to load in other maps for different functions that this map doesn't have. Thanks. Drawing attention using 4 stars. | Best mapping app, at least for Czechia. Much better arranged compared to the Google maps, that looks like 50 shades of gray and beige. Pub and shops icons are displayed all at once, Google shows them dynamically, who pays more is shown, other pubs are visible in really close zoom only. So it really hard guess what is in vicinity just by looking on the map. Metro exits in Prague are easily visible on Mapy.cz, not so much for Google map. | Best hiking maps for Android | Great for detailed information, not recommending the navigation.. | Very good! | Great apps for navigation!!!👍👍👍 | Very detailed oudoor maps | Way better than google maps for Czechia | The maps are a top dollar 5* experience. Like looking at an oldfashioned typographical map. They have really stepped up the game recently. The app is more or less perfect now. Still suggesting alternative and completely useless routes along the way, but at least they are in grey now and not sharp colours confusing to the eye. | It's perfekt for hiking and riding. The details are marvelous! The best I know! | So far most user friendly app - legible, fast, intuitive, practical - as compared to laptop, the best feature is however customizable plotting of loop tracks . It will create loop tracks based on your input parameters...splendid if you do not know the area.As compared to backcountry guru maps, and viewranger If you travel worldwide this is the best even with the limited topo capabilities, e.g. slope available on line only. Definitely great back up for usually unreliable gps plotting apps. Still | Will not work after this last update | Samotná navigace je super, bohužel používání pro android auto kdy bych rád měl i při jízdě bez navigace ukazatel rychlosti a upozornění na policii atd. Tak jako to má waze. | Great offline capabilities. Well detailed maps. Recommend for outdoor enthusiasts. | Free trail maps. Love it | Gold standard for hiking | Easy to use, maps are sufficiently informative (Bulgaria). It is great that you can type a starting and ending point like on Google maps. You can even link multiple points on the map to create a route and save it. | Nice! Very good map & navigation! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Velice perfektni pouziti pri planu trasy pesky, behu, na kole, bezkach, skialpech, sneznicich... (zimni mapa luxus). Rychla kontrola trasy pri aktivitach. Zlepseni a pridanim navigace i trackeru. Hmmm skoro kazdodenni pouziti aplikace. Nezbyva nez smeknout klobouk a podekovat velice. Zaverem rici kez by bylo takovych appek vice! Jen tak dal. | Great, free offline maps. | Super! | This is the best navigational app I've ever used. Only problem with this is that it doesx not show the POI's when you are on a route so you can't see when you reach a POI. | Great app. Wish it was easier to make an account | Great detailed maps, good App ♥️ | Very good maps, with cycling and hiking routes. Really enjoying it. Offline navigation works perfectly. | I wonder if you can help as the help page is in Czech language. If I create a route in the app which includes dirt roads the app will not let me follow this route,it chooses a route only using tarmac roads. The application is advertised as being useful for cycling and hiking. Even if I add extra via points it still will not follow a route across dirt roads. Creating these routes on a computer can be done but not in the app. Is there any way to do this because the app itself is extremely good! | Very useful app. Works perfectly | Cannot create account.. SMS is not working.. Worst account creation process.. | I love mapy CZ specifically because of the contour lines that it has, helping me to know the altitude of a place easily | Best app for hiking in Central Europe! | The only app i have found which co tain most of the subroutes in South Africa. Usually extremely accurate and has saved me a few times in terms of routefinding hard sections | Awesome!!! | I use it all the time for any trailwalk or hike. Great app! | Very useful app.Thank a lots 👍 | We hiked in fog,darkness. Pinpoint to the mountain refuge. | Great app for outdoor navigation. Accurate and free maps which you can download for offline use is exceptional. | Great detail | Nejlepsi appka na svete, turisticky mapy fungujou snad vsude na svete. Dik za ni. | Great app and up to date map! Very good navigation! | good maps with great color scheme | Od poslední aktualizace nepoužitelné pro navigaci. Co chvíli se ztrácí GPS signál a vyhledává. Lokace skáče kolem dokola pár desítek metrů od aktuální l. Přístup k poloze je povolen a při používání aplikace k přesné poloze Musím teď používat Google maps, které tyto problémy nemají. Zatím žádná nová verze dostupná :-( Nechci dávat malé hodnocení protoze jinak je aplikace super. Telefon: Realme 11 Pro+ | Very good outdoor maps | Terrible design, bad ui, doesnt work how i would imagine a map to work at all. Can someone design a good map app? Why do i not get results for what i search? I search ""shop"" and only get results with the name shop in it, no supermarkets, nothing, only ""shop"". Sometimes the map gives me results that are hundreds of kilometers away!?! When i search for something near a bus stop, it gives no results. only good thing about this app is the actual map, like the map for woods, forest trails is great. | Supr | Awesome app, easy to use, easy to understand. It has save me more than once! Can't recommend it enough | Easy to use, reliable and with accurate maps! | Not able to install offline maps on my new SD card (Realme 8 / Android 13 + RealmeUI 4). Camera works fine with the same SD card, so there is no reason, why Mapy.cz should not recognize it. | Free offline maps for the entire world! Trails, paths, roads, and businesses | Love the offline maps | Best visual cartographical aesthetics of topographic maps. but I miss former perfect offline modes... | Absolute fantastic map app with offline capabilities. A must have for outdoors hiking. | najlepsie mapy na turistiku | Superb! | The best map for hiking and cycling. | Much better than Google Maps for more remote locations. | Excellent, can now also import gpx files | Bombice! | The best maps for hiking and cycling | Just found link. Will tell you more when used | really nice app, use it each time I travel and I have no wifi or internet connection. Quite good for walking in town. But sometime, if map are not updated they are not visible at all and that can be bothering if you didn't see it before... The offline map should be readable even if it's not updated as road, building doesn't move thst fast. | Excellent app, can use it all over the world 👍. Good detail and works well as a driving seat nav | very good | Perhaps the best navigation map | Při plánování cesty autem nedokáže ""projet"" tunelem Munt la Schera. Ani když v trase dám průjezdní bod před tunel a za tunelem. | I find the app good to organise my bicycle routes on the road and my running in forest... | THE BEST! Maps available for many countries at good scale. Never let me down.... | What a great app. I can't recommend anything else. | Awesome app for cycle touring | Always reliable | The best navi apps | cannot verify my account. sent countless texts as requested, nothing comes back. | I've used it in Austria, Greece and Hungary and I love it! | I have downloaded all off-line maps for Australia but there's sections that have highways just stopping and town names completely missing. Even the borders between states aren't there? | Co si máme povídat... Nejlepší v Čechách (to říká vám kurýr s 7 let praxe), a to ne jen že Mapy cz mají nejlépsi kartografie v Čechách, ale aj vůbec funkcionality apku a interface... Ne můžu si představit že bych šel už do jiné Mapy/Na... | Great app. Useful for finding hidden paths that are not visible on another maps. Great offline access. Unfortunately navigation exits once phone is locked, please fix it. | Podrobnost map je mnohem lepší než konkurence, už funguje i navigace dobře a firmy se už taky dají najít. Ještě pár much to má, ale klobouk dolů. A kupodivu fungují na místech kde Google maps ne. | pridejte prpsim jednodussi zpusob Pridat bod pri navigaci / Add stop nejdou Tipy na vylety na turisticke mapě super turisticke mapy, hodnoceni ale nefunguje jako v Google maps, chtelo by vylepsit, zbytečně slozite hodnoceni a schvaluje se | Absolutely brilliant Especially offline | Skvělá appka na mapy, nejlepší pro turistiku, cyklistiku, výborná i na silnici, v zimě, dobrá už i pro výběr české restaurace/hotelu apod. 2 hvězdičky dole za: chybějící fotomapu a měření pomocí bodů, za hloupé přeskakování na mapě, když člověk něco zavře (třeba trasu), za horší vyhledávač a za někdy velké nepřesnosti v cizině. | Very nice map navigation with real offline mode. Fast, detailed, easy readable, can calculate routes in offline mode. | In Pakistan, it's still needed some more time to improve. | Pridali ste zdielanie polohy. Super! Skoda, ze nefunguje ako v Google maps. Rad by som polohu zdielal aj bez pustenej navigacie. Zdielanie cez link je tiez tazkopadne. Chyba mi zobrazenie priemerneho sklonu v percentach na naplanovanej trase. Systém plánovania trasy by mal byť rýchlejší - ocenil by som možnosť pridávania bodov hneď za sebou bez nutnosti najprv kliknúť na ""pridat bod"" a až potom tuknúť do mapy. V casti ""my maps' je obtiazne menit poradie/presuvat trasy - ikonka je moc mala. | Don't understand what's going on here. Downloaded all Australians off-line maps and they don't work. Highways just stop in the middle of the map and most towns don't show. Also borders between states won't display? | Best outdoor, offline navigation, trail/track planning maps so far. Those maps are real topographic maps, not a joke. And free to download and use for offline navigation which is amazing feature. You can save your trails/tracks, export/import GPX files while still being simple and easy to use. I've tried many different hiking/outdoor navigation apps and maps, but nothing can beat precision of Mapy.cz. Not even Garmin maps. Very much recommended to any outdoor enthusiasts in Europe. | Naučí se někdy mapy.cz navigovat podle mhd (praha, brno, ...) Aspoň tak jako Google maps? | Best navigation app. You can use it for bike touring and it gives you even the weather forecast on the map! It allows you to download multiple maps at the same time. You can even choose section of a country (north, south, or particular regions...) TO IMPROVE: Login with Facebook/Google missing. | Excellent | Love it ! | Asks for telephone number to create an account | Great App. | Opening a GPS track forces you to create an account to seznam.cz, which has nothing to do with gps mapping. | Great app, but unable to get registered, why can't it be done through Email ? | Fantastic app | Great map for hiking, it has all the small paths that are not on most of the other apps, and I like the tracking where it tells you elevation gain, distance and average speed. I recommend this, offline maps for download is a good feature if you have bad signal in some places. | The best app ever!!! | Amazing app really useful | Mapy.cz shows you many ways and shortcuts which are not visible on Google maps. | Excellent for hiking anywhere in the world. Maps for driving sometimes inaccurate. | I used mapy for walking in Alsace, Brittany in France and Sussex UK and between the Algerian border and Tunis. It was excellent especially in Fr and UK. It was well detailed in Tunisia but did not show in some area established electricity lines and some well used roads. I expect that the small scale maps of Tunisia 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 are not available or do not exist. | It is a good app and the one I use for city driving | works great, trails marked on it well | Great app, very helpful and it works offline | Does everything I expect. | Great sport-focussed alternative to Gmaps. Super handy | Best map app available, in my opinion. ""Outdoor"" map is particularly high quality, like an OS map. Integrates seamlessly with GPS and compass to provide both position and orientation. Plus the ability to download maps by country, so it works outside of mobile signal. I don't use the sat nav function, so can't comment on that. | Super | Velmi mi schází tmavý mód i mimo navigování (není to jen o vzhledu, je to důležité při použití za šera či tmy). | Keď chcem po ceste niekam pridať rýchlu zastávku (napr bankomat) tak je absolutne nemožné to efektívne urobiť keďže v navigácii nieje žiadna rýchla možnosť na vyhľadanie zastávky po ceste. Jediná možnosť je modifikovať celú pôvodnú trasu s tým že pri vyhľadávaní výsledkov vám automaticky neukáže miesta ktoré sú popri vašej trase ale miesta úplne mimo cesty. Toto prosím nejak fixnite (napr ako má google maps, kde prehľadne ukazuje ""zajížďku"") a zmením hodnotenie na 5 hviezdičiek. | Awesome! Can recommend trails for cycling and navigate on them for free. May be not the best ones, though. | Offline mapy se dají stahovat jen podle názvů regionů, které samozřejmě v Rakousku neznám. Výběr z mapy by byl přehlednější | Very helpful map. Just the handling/ operation could be improved. Thank you | Super aplicația dar m-am chinuit 2 ore sa mă înregistrez | The app seems nice, but insists on getting your phone number. And when I finally decided to give it, it didn't work. | Awesome maps | Brilliant maps with brilliant features, also usfull outside Czech republic. Should become european standard :) | Super | Brilliant App and walking aid. | Aplikace Mapy.cz je SKVELA! Velmi detailni, dobre se pouziva. Je intuitivni, staci zapnout start a muzete jit/bezet .... Aplikace nepada, ani se neseka. Sve aktivity si muzete zaznamenavat do folderu a delat si sve osobni trasy. | Will be your preferred hiking map | Best one if you like hiking. Long live to OpenStreetMaps!! Would be awesome that we could search routes by their name and trail appeared on the map. Here in Spain we have walking routes called GR. When you do a search (for example GR 83) appear some results but they are mostly not useful, however sometimes, there is a result that gives exactly what I'm suggesting (very hidden and sometimes doesn't even appear). Thanks for this cool app! | Fantastic for navigation when hiking | Awesome app. Very useful! | Asi najlepšia apka na plánovanie trás na Slovensku.","{""1"":7272,""2"":3308,""3"":5870,""4"":26698,""5"":170119}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 23.99 if billed through Play","8.0","8.0","VARY","Seznam.cz, a.s.","8961380020761803090","mobilni@mapy.cz","https://aplikace.seznam.cz/","Radlická 3294/10, 15000, Praha 5","https://licence.mapy.cz/?doc=mapy_zzoo&lang=en","8961380020761803090","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EqUqDykotPGEMJSwuAbwiFBaqGTlnx9S4-hCJDC3HmAiAX1ocGeh3tumyArOYuiDGwk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ljLA7yQXB4V73jI0henz0oQraqVOtWvhVMM9djkXncu5npmUVIh02LgeW_39vTVemg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wVfNspJa63XvSUMqouBShmXLfENjPpSC5jo1mysxY0MT12qYdBkLk7gfsrymUGtggA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_Wtd4NvUtkM_1rGAVpjEr0vzoVLNZI1S1JObqmehHo5IXnL0V4kSZSrsW04w_COFfbo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IoNgUMySqQQVzMwUOltF4tnbbcjkwAUcN3TPzs0FYsiHM5pT4Vv164AAYm6domFwdw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nq7XgWWkxCJKNL1k2Ko3Ig32ZAVUFJW768kFEqRTJa-CiMV8mSYpPAfSOKNHGAUklQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JbJisuvndjNi7x6WZWjwgfxh3Etm9-n4-a05wJTZJkGf5m2maseE6pyF2bXfLFB2VDs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Q3-YmGx9tWlglpwQVjWAFszvahJv5JsBKM9WoCbS03-UaNOCspJggfK_kHMNxqIRgB8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JJ5FcVxSmvQx2BZwUyZ_7wtyQyiSALnbDV0RNh56SlFT9sA6zl8tN8jlRCJV5UuKsg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GkmMfPmoOjw5sOPAQjPvDSRiGFvLDI7-SlcXwkhA9A4m4GUMWyCB5CvcTsr8LZyDdXij"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7zck17_AqPDYT3L-aQ7h6x5db78V-3TIEswF_GektG3sCagKN_I_0oyVcRfNLx6e9w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/03Ol3IdK5XL-IoaeBgXIIFGz61t_JE3uKyviCdUq_AvXJkiBltycGAbGXAN_okXWj8g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Zj3VMIy_1TP2zLzoXTwskblWkyP7sK2J0VxkGu_UJxuQ8LkqTn4jORjb0LKmcFfdRpI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tY0t2k9kTkvHOGhD8lFXijHModpUGAWv3LrEOM24c30HyCgb536pW4lJdbBqI4z4Cjxp"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/32I-wnWyNlrEt00yq5uAVks8pfk3PbYSARyj2_oAapliF40OTFbStFlsbvZLSlaqoDs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DgkbzzBIwcUdTjnHlau7p7n25UHpfpB_QZhR0R0Y_UHm4ZpmRu5vtvETiUW6DpTlRQQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vADDWsRnULDSx-sXl6eNb1rdl-vNE3CNe_C-NTpfwzTl_Z80mVPfz6YeCfdzketZW4E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rVzoAVIr3Q3bg-WAAeYfX8FXPtD8yyjzHI7mnYsKCj2BRbZp6EWVGcJ-YKSM7IvhHlM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oXm8vnRi97Y1rGiEMCK-4h-OtzYgmRpM98JUgPyIhE6ZPSBiGmG7hZJiKcpLub2OWl4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gAnnV4MkKQI9ZPNjG1nwfyfMDLksBolnokrH4pSV8v9WM5hUunuHMDYWh4JaQnJN_oU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9HujmjZUULlj7_0QNiYkIRkjgSZccdzkw1Azilcxo7KW6V-EoeuogLOHjwZBZqggX7o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zuNpEmOXoqNUF6-6RUxwtDMUyseg8UnTI_PFP8KaxAD8g8DPbDcWs90BfMEVuJSy96Un"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LzqT8m21tYcTLtEX071wM1K8ZtPS-9vhwh6dztPnS0-9BnodThi18ww8QSJlV32sEnfX"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9DlJhFvu8O2pe0P30E3EYna_2Cq5HcPyvyQcbowu4rMon-5Isw2WMg1N94VPyCTIu3c"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JtFVAiu1EutgH1TNyj30uhHE06rs23VktCCjwLvIN7PdHZ086yE4jg6SMx-3p_b0lmI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RRYvDdE_tDGYbaxZs2qStTapEgs15YC9uMl69eSV-pV00fvZZrjoRe1mAIrM6-4K7LI""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EA4nHOpR5g?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ljLA7yQXB4V73jI0henz0oQraqVOtWvhVMM9djkXncu5npmUVIh02LgeW_39vTVemg",,"PEGI 3",,true,"Apr 7, 2011",1710504508000,"9.46.0","Small fixes and improvements.","[""Best mapping app, at least for Czechia.

The app crashes multiple times and I have to restart it always. Marketplace listings do not show the price of the items and clicking the listing in the chat does no longer allow to open the ads, which makes it very difficult to keep track of what I am selling/buying. Utterly shocking. | Can't access it. Used to be able no something is asking for a PIN. | A lot if issues and privacy concerns but works enough. Barely functionable | Can't massage everyone | Good luck on this email app experience. | Good | Bad | Good App | Excellent | ilovethisapp | Super | That's bro | The ""read"" timestamp is always the same with the ""delivered"" one. If I log in via Windows I can see the right timestamp. This used to work on older versions of messenger but you decided to force a ""mandatory"" update in order to keep using it. Please fix it. | Can we please get a quick scroll Tab on the side to see old messages | I like this app | Good | Great app to get somebody's phone number if you lost it how did your contacts somehow. Show me down part is that Facebook Messenger is not decentralized. Everything you type or speak on this platform get saved to Google's AWS...

This new one messed up the app worse than it was before the last update, if you can call it ""update"". They're more a downgrade at this point. • I can't scroll up old messages. It bumps me back to the most recent. • I can't always hear voice messages. I have to close the app completely in order to listen them, & repeat over again. • I sent a text message, it went through as usual. The person received/read it. I saw it there sent/received/read. Two days later, disappeared.💨 | Good | Vivo 27 | Nice | Stop automatically encrypting messages | Thank you from my anyone public my friends see call video and remember to call my friends and family and another thank you app massenger | God djx | I DONT HAVE THE EDIT OPTION 😭😭😭 | Why is it saying it will be installed soon I need it now | Great | Supar | really like it | I like this app it make chatting easy | خطیب | An amazing app love it. | Slow | Nice inclusion towards social media 😎👑👀 | Better | ZawZaw | Good | Excellent 👌 | No comments? | Good i love it | Massenger not working help me | This is the worst app ever to connect with family now. Before it was okay, but now they have changed it. You can not connect with family or message. Anybody anymore without giving them your Google account? Meaning everything on your Google account is going to Facebook. I have important information on my Google account Like my card. All I want to do is message my husband and now I can't. This has become the worst app ever. | Update muy ngai marn dg? | Nice application | Excellent | Hindi ko gaanong nagustuhan ang bagong update ni fb, naka²dismaya kasi ang hirap makita kita kong meron bang online or online ba yung person na dapat mong contacin hirap din tumawag kasi hindi sya nag riring.😔😔😔 | Why do I need to access my email or a pun key to log in? | Good | Can't watch reels sent to me from contacts | Best app for video chats | they automatically add end to end encryption to my convo which annoys me a lot because this feature cannot be remove on a specific conversation. | Need a pin now. | Good | আমার জান আখি | Hi sir Iron sheet roof Fabrication ms welding work iron Grill per square feet | Extraordinary | 1 star lng kasi walang laplapan sa call | kumain na po ako | Good app bro | Idk what is going but since the last update it doesn't show my messages U less I go in the app itself. I have restarted my phone and my internet thinking they were just glitching. I have uninstalled and reinstalled messenger twice and it's still happening. I get the notification, but if i use the chat head it doesn't update the message nor does the app ever show anyone on. I literally have to go to people and wait a few seconds than go back to chat before I see anyone actually on | Good | Messenger is great | nice | 𝘔𝘺 𝘣𝘴𝘵 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 | No notifications with Samsung J 1.Why????? | This aapp is best | The newest update where you have to create some sort of backup for your messages is stupid. The fact that you cannot opt out of this option is even worse.

So many issues and problems happening on a daily basis! Soo frustrating | Ok | too many security | Messenger suck so slow and too many bugs | Won't update | Trouble with hackers | Ryui | I use this app as my main form of messaging and I love using it as such but a few things have erked me in the past mainly with huge group chats all of a sudden pinging when I've set it mute. But more then that right now something I can't figure out how it's not working at all for links anymore, I wouldn't mind if this was links to external sights that just aren't working, which they sometimes still do. What's really irritating is that none of thr link to Facebook itself work on this app at all! | Ok | 😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍 | Vai amar phone danlod hy na | Does this app allow users to order food for delivery? | Great | Nice app | Best | Good | Thankyou | Helpful | I can't open Messengep | I LOVE IT THANKS. | Well | I find it arrogant of Facebook to provide no change list for their upgrades. | I cant fix the person is unavailable in messenger i foxed before but the restrict thing isnt there. | I love it! | I love this app | Great | good | Very good | Nice good apps vwry useful this | Good... | I love it 😍😍😍 | As of now Last week of March, 2024, very worst app (the Messenger) because it always ask for update and PIN.

Jen mi přijde, že některé podniky ji využívají jen pro své zviditelnění. | Lowering raring as the app does not work. Everything is blank, does not load and I don't receive notifications 😩 | Negativní komentáře jsou mazány, hodnocení nabídek v aplikaci má tedy nulovou výpovědní hodnotu. | Zajímavá myšlenka, ale je potřeba si nalít čistého vína a říct si, že ve většině případů nejde o zachraňování světa nebo jedení jídla, které by jinak skončilo v koši. Je to marketing, nic víc. Starbucks, který mapu naprosto dominuje, je krásným příkladem. | Hodilo by se mít více filtrů. Například odfiltrovat si Penny, které je na mapě skoro všude a spíše mě zajímají jiné podniky. | Koncept velmi dobrý, ale ta aplikace je zoufale pomalá. Dobré by bylo tlačítko filtru - zobrazení aktivních/všech nabídek. | Chybí možnost zrušit objednávku. Systém balíčků, kdy člověk kupuje v podstatě zajíce v pytli je k NIČEMU. Člověk doufám, že budou třeba dva sandwiche cca 1000kalorii, dojde do krámu a dostane nějaké sušenky. Cukrářské výrobky ten stejný problém. Nemožnost schovat podniky co mě absolutně nezajímají je taky velká nevýhoda, začíná to být nepřehledné | Dobře a jednoduché. | I like the concept and this app but unfortunately it is pretty slow and lags a lot. | Amazing selections and always working properly. Got used to using it for all kinds of goods; sweet, savoury, flowers you name it. | I love the app and the concept behind it. The only thing I do not appreciate is that the is no ""in stock"" filter for the map. Otherwise it would be perfect! | Amazing app! Super useful for not wasting. 💚 | Naprosto skvela appka!!! | Aplikace dobrá, Starbucks balíček horší :-( | Slow and bad application | Do recommend! | This is a lie. Restaurants offer not leftovers from unsold food, but food of terrible quality. | Po přechodu do zelene appky.. des, hrůza a chaos... Téměř kvůli tomu už appku ani nepoužívam | super služba, lepší filtrovaní a větší výběr podniků by byl fajn | Super věc 👍 | Nikdy v živote som nevidela pomalšiu aplikáciu ako táto. Nová verzia s novým designom je nepoužiteľná, už len na zmenu mesta z Prahy na Brno čakám niekoľko sekúnd. Rada som objednávala cez nesnezeno, ale toto sa naozaj nedá používať. | Krok zpět. Opravdu špatné UX. Nedaří se mi ani dokončit nákup (jsem vyzván k vyplnění jména ale bohužel není, kde jej vyplnit). Košík nefunguje jako košík, protože nejsem schopen koupit více zboží v jedné objednávce. Zboží nelze z košíku odstranit. Místy nelogická navigace. UI je nedotažené - ikony různých velikostí, které různě poskakují, špatně řešené stíny, usekávající se text, tlačítko ""-"" v košíku má zelenou barvu namísto oranžové atd. Koncept balíčků se mi líbí. | Super koncept, avšak update z jednoduchej a prehladnej aplikácie spravil neprehľadnú a ešte aj pomalú aplikáciu | Appka mě baví, šetří mi penízky! Super za mě. | Was good before the update, after that not only constantly logging out but also not remembering settings of preferences and showing random places at the map that are no close to the actual location. | Nevím, jestli to někdo koupil ale aplikace je po redesignu otřesná. Předchozí nastavení zmizelo (včetně platebních metod). Vypadá to jako úmyslná sabotáž. | Probably depends on the store how they add the offer, most are now mystery boxes with pastry or a meal but with some of them you know exactly what you're buying. Definitely worth keeping eye on. The more stores join in the future the better of course! | dost dobra appka pre studenta s minimom casu a obmedzenym budgetom, rychle prehladavanie aj platenie, spokojnost :) | Hodnocení po velkém update aplikace. Změna byla nečekaná, ze začátku jsem byla hodně zklamaná že se v aplikaci nachází pouze balíčky. Nicméně cca 14 dní po změně je vidět že přibylo hodně nových podniků a i nabídka není jen o balíčcích. Věřím, že s dalším časem se nová tvář aplikace vykrystalizuje do 5 hvězdiček. | Dneska měla akorát vypadek ale jinak funguje dobře. Samotný koncept se mi velice líbí a na vyzkoušení cukráren vážně super | Oproti předchozí verzi nepoužitelné. | Spousta zelené. Mám rád zelenou. A taky jídlo za fajn cenu. Mám rád jídlo za fajn cenu. | Thanks for the reply but I am lowering the rating as from user's point of view these updates make no sense. This is an app for buying lefover food from restaurants. There must be the option to like the restaurant as a whole and not be only able to like selected products. The ""products"" are different every day, these are restaurants, not supermarkets with fixed offer. Because of that I now don't get notified about offers from my favourite places as they always offer new stuff. | Po update se aplikace téměř nedá použít. Je méně přehledná, je problém s platby kartou. Nevím proč transakce se zasekla a musel jsem to platit na 3x. Hodnocení původně 5 hvězd, ale po update je to katastrofa. Důvody: -Proč hned není jasné o jaký typ jídla se jedná (např. balíčky ze starbucksu) -Proč vidím jídlo, které už se nenabízí. Zbytečně to mate. -Proč platba probíhá komplikovaněji, než u předchozí verze -Proč jsou nahoře nabídky, které ani nejsou reklama. Jenom upoutávky...nedává smysl | The new version of this app is not great. Everything is now in packages, so you can't actually know what you are buying, which to me made this app useless. Also, food that is not available keeps popping up. This used to be an amazing app. | Every offers are not available, also it logged me out for unknown reason. All (one) offers is only Starbucks... so useless app. | Zbytečně zkomplikované oproti předchozí verzi. Méně je někdy více. | Aktualizace, která extrémně zkomplikovala používání této aplikace. Aplikace si nepamatuje nastavení lokace, přidání zbytečných záložek jako je lokalita, která funguje jen v praze, pro hledání nabídek je nutno přepnout do jiné záložky. To vše znamená, že nalezení nabídky trvá přibližně 10x déle. Také zobrazení již nedostupných nabídek je horší (černobílé zobrazení bylo rozhodně přehlednější). | Not usefull anymore | Nová appka je katastrofa.. jsou v ní pouze starbucksy a to i ty, kteří se nesnezena neúčastní (po koupi balíčku mi obsluha na černém mostě řekla, ze jejich pobočka součástí programu není. UI je chaotické, nové tlačítko complete order je matoucí, že jsem si ho omlylem odkliknul sám, vůbec není indikace, že to je tlacitko pro obsluhu (bývalý slide button byl lepší). Dále také se tam míchají jazyky, chvílema česky, anglicky, pak dokonce maďarsky. Bývalá appka byla rozhodně daleko lepší. | co to jako je #cider#puffbar#cotojakoje#notsatisfied | Veľmi prehľadné, až mam pocit, že niečo chýba. Ale stačí k spokojnosti | Zvysujem z 2 na 4. Zvaly su uz konecne stale a tak sa nestane ze tam niekto nahadzuje svoju ponuku a zlavy ju o 10%. Taktiez v appke vsetci uz poctivo nahadzuju alergeny. old:Nie je mozne nastavit si filtrovanie len bezlepkovych ponuk takze 99% ma nezaujima. Nie je mozne nastavit si filtrovanie len do urciteho kilometra okolo mna, takze 99% zobrazeni ma nezaujima. Niektore podniky by som rad dal do ignore listu, ale appka taku moznost neponuka 🤷 inak fajn pokus o nieco ekologicke a ekonomicke. | Výborná myšlenka, ale aplikace mi reálně nikdy nepomohla nějakou nabídku najít. Špatně se v ní vyhledávají podniky, notifikace vyskakuji asi na sponzorované podniky - stále stejné, typicky frančízové řetězce, relativně vzdálené a s nezajimavou nabídkou. Nic od podniků ze seznamu oblíbených. Příležitostně na cestách jsem si aplikaci nezvykl používat. PS: dnes spadl server, takže aplikace neukazuje nic. | Myslím, že váš úkol je nelehká a dlouhá cesta. Velmi fandím fajn myšlence. Předpokládám, že vám píše mnoho lidí a sami se snažíte působení rozšířit. Myslím, že by stálo za zvážení oslovit některé liberecké restaurace. Krajské město, spousta možností. Navíc 13km vedle je Jablonec, takže spousta lidí mezi městy pendluje. Kéž se daří! | It's super easy to use. Not many options yet, but hopefully more will follow soon! | Super napad ale prevedenie... Ziadne vyhladavanie ci filtre (typ restauracie, cena, vegan...), na mape sa zobrazuju i podniky ktore aktualne nemaju ziadne jedlo (ziadne i uz zjedene; keby boli aspon inak oznacene). Chybaju uplne zakladne funkcie. Obrazky su pre mna osobne prilis velke, ocenil by som moznost mensieho textu. Kazdopadne je skvele ze tato aplikacia existuju a vyhadzuje sa menej jedla, len UI by sa dal vylepsit. | Aplikace je ok ale prijde mi, ze to podniky zacinaji zneuzivat. Stava se z toho damejidlo bez rozvozu. Sleva ze 159 na 149? Zebirka z 319kc na 299? To ani nejsou slevy. Je to drazsi jak v hospode. Pokud je potreba nutne se jidla zbavit bez toho, aby se vyhodilo, sleva 3% mi neprijde na miste. | Great selection&very positive atmosphere.Unfortunately,the application still insists on location permission.Thanks so for your reply!That's a good idea&will help a bit but my actual location permission is still necessary. :( Will you guys consider allowing users to type in the address they want to deliver the food to? 'Cause it's a super idea but I have friends stuck in quarantine who I'd love to send doughnuts to.Tried&paid but have to cancel the order now.Delivery wasn't included in the bill. | Alespon nazev mohl byt spravne cesky-tedy Nesnědeno!...copak jste dnes snezli? holt Brno;-) | Nice app. There is a room for improvement. Add filters. For example, by food type (mexican, indian, vegetarian, vegan etc.), by the discount rate (as for some people it is important), Add a search function (by name, food type, etc.) Think of working with shops (it is a huge market as well) Develop a dark mode as ""light attracts bugs"" (c) Add Order ID to the order info (main page of the order). It's not user-friendly to click on ""doklad"" to check it. I like what you are doing. Keep going. | Nice app for saving food not eaten in proper time schedule ;) Or do you prefer late lunch? So this app is also perfect for you! Now also for take-away and saving restaurants... | It helps me to discover new places, have a great food4 half price! Awesome👍😉 | Naprosto úžasná aplikace! Po vylepšení nastavení města je to naprosto úžasné!!! ❤️❤️❤️ | Riadne super napad | Super nápad, super aplikace. | Devs took criticism to heart and updated the app. It now allows for filtering through location in one of its two pages. The page with restaurants still shows places from other cities. There's a map feature but as far as I can tell it only shows the restaurants on a map, which feels useless. Needs filtering there as well. And maybe re-think the use cases for the map feature, as it doesn't make mich sense. | Nesnezeno se porad vyvyji, s kazdou verzi je lepsi a myslim, ze jde o skvely projekt. | It shows offers in different location, even though I have a location on... and that is really annoying | Great idea! Thank you! | Jen škoda že se zatím nezapojila žádná restaurace v Pardubicích/Chrudimi, jinak cením tento nápad! | Nejlepší nápad a appka super. :) | Skvělý nápad, ale nabídky mi zase tak skvělé nepřišly a v některých mistexh nich zase tak noc nebylo | skvela myslenka a super ux aplikace :) | Unfortunately not available for most cities, just Praha, Brno, Ostrava, Olomouc basically. | V Ostravě téměř nic a propagovaná Olomouc není ani v nabídce. | Naozaj skvelá appka, funguje dokonale. | aplikácia funguje na výbornú | very good | A great idea! The app is reallly smooth, excellent designed and a very user friendly interface. | Veľmi pekná aplikácia a super projekt! :) | app does not work for LG G6. 3 from 4 buttons on the bottom are not active, and some icon is flashing in bottom left corner. App is not compatible with software system buttons (home,back) | Dobrý myšlenka, ale pouze Brno, Ostrava a Budějovice :/","{""1"":342,""2"":96,""3"":139,""4"":117,""5"":653}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Nesnězeno.cz s.r.o.","Nesn%C4%9Bzeno.cz+s.r.o.","info@nesnezeno.cz","https://nesnezeno.cz",,"https://nesnezeno.eco/privacy-policy/","Nesn%C4%9Bzeno.cz+s.r.o.","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r-nBLUnl3iBs4NY8tFXziijGlv5KI1rEJkOVLZQHfmFbA09ky1sOALHIluxHRIcwcQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wHXDgMaNN7k-_g5mfCFYUZDDctUrOqc-Ifi4R0jGG0QRIc40qhRIYR8tT41RYDmf3CJQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r5Gm5p6xFuJShPmFSxvIDJ0w1te90FJcmHtwP_TSsyhrCsXXMVlMvQyyBlCzBTNqbxg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/K00KrfpFRVT7fo7NM1Llm-ekepnQsHy4T4VCxOAO2WXMlEGjwbodCTrNdoMxqk0fHQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Qj4NbG4w1eHATdYc3p-WU7Emy4HP14oIsBTT1VlJ2h8V3rN4W5SJB03ALG0KusMG5_6f"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7yWGVoWeP1LKyaGqMt7c4PmLmua_IMxLfKps8l6Xlvf0gp0ceTTVjT4X_RSdqbMMttQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gOY7TQymILIWtu26Nuspry2BEqIv846d7Efc-5sD5NOrFpy5sO8YBGQu8oK6iZsin45k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Wm6IKvl_iWLx-uYeOBoTxQWtPIkHA7bhJbGRgTtYm5YO-ocavdrapN1x-DdUortREgw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GZaJCbcsZ-hHR3waYsM7dgQmMRQqq82jhBLvQbyOB3S2el2Zrh41E-TSuUXjoL3cCxcM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XuyB5WaU2cHps8O5p1bp9EK79AoB8qvhVTEXvR7JOEmOtoInAGaPSqMmaPUemtiqrQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H1YxGZOW1bbbNmMRknd_kDbt6vWTC8rngKVrA1QX3-fC3hHkdYzMjj4qRfT7UUSqTA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bQvUTtoSSRo8w1YO4xnA3GyyX9MPqzfCc_mpgbMbghwyOq_6q98vpwky04t4P8yD7Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yefNpvMwAILFP3GKTvERuH8qKL3Z5lQi-wi9OATKZB82oAFC7q6ZSVGpnzZa64iJbY4_"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KpmvkOo22Rvb7lpWIbymnRnY3u5UUxcD0ns_zwG26E6ju-MKjpub88wFGKK6N0F9Weu6""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Apr 29, 2019",1710164972000,"4.9.0","Small changes &amp; bugfixes","[""Devs took criticism to heart and updated the app. It now allows for filtering through location in one of its two pages.

So easy to use, would recommend highly!!!😊 | Revolut is a nice online bank ..... I love their services and is superb. | Happy | It's very good | Generally good. Convenient and informative. Would like to see a savings account introduction with an ECB interest rate not an Irish banking monopoly interest rate | Simple and easy to operate! | Everything is good about it | Pure garbage. I tried many times to sign-up.. using my phone number.. but I have never received the SMS with the code. I tried even by website. When I put the number it says: ""success"" but then it loads again the page.. and finish there.. nothing happens.. | Easy to use. In so many way's | Excellent and easy card for travel | Perfect finance tool! | Best secure banking ❤️ | Good good | Im unable to use the app, and im forced to change my passcode out of the blue | brilliant service | Convenient app. | Just try getting to speak to someone, or sending them a message. Waste of time! | After update asks me to set a new pass code and I never use that function, only biometrical login.. And now since the app goes to the change password screen I can't use.. Not even for contact support.. Fix this or at least give the option to contact support or any way to recover it.. | Today application referred to an updated security rules and start to force to change passcode from 4 to 6 digits without allowing to skip this step and use any other functionality. I tried 4 different combinations all with the same result operation forbidden. | Excellent thanks | Far exceeded my expectations. Probably the most useful app on my phone. Simple, practical, and works perfectly. Extremely useful for all travellers, both work and holiday. Thank you Revolut. | Pretty Good Tbh easy to use and navigate. I think preminum should be 4.99 not 7.99 maybe add a few more subscriptions but overall its not bad. | AI support is better then physical people... | Ordered card did not arrived, sending money to my main bank was taking multiple weeks and without help of other revolute user, i would not get my salary and died of starvation. (After some time) I reordered and did not used the card for over year as I learned how to only use online money and had different bank. My card got deleted | Long back and forth with tech support about not being able to receive payments from anyone, leading nowhere as I was constantly handed over from one tech support to the next, each one losing context of my issue. I emailed Revolut directly but got an automated response to use the in-app chat, which as detailed above was no longer an option. | Just started and so far is ok. | app keeps saying crashed even when i have forced closed it, getting stopped working warnings every 15 mins cant use my phone without uninstalling it. someone needs to lose their job | I changed the device, and I wasn't aware that I had to keep the old one. I locked out of the app, and there is no customer service assistance | very bad apps and service. I advise you not to subscribe. I signed up 7 month ago and my account still not verified. They got my money and I can't withdraw my money back. Rubbish | The best banking app ever. | Easy to use and ridiculously easy to setup. | Doesn't work on some machines especially in Tescos | It's safe to use. And I can make a dispute with less hastle if there's a mistake in sending. | The app runs properly again | Fast, user friendly | Been using Revolut since 2017 and wouldn't travel abroad without it. I upgraded recently to the Black metal card amd get free FT subscription plus can take £800 a month in cash in foreign currency free of charge.. | Great everything i want | Very good. Really like it. | Excellent account | Very good app, only thing is missing is to dpare change for joint accounts. | Nice | This app is not working on the Samsung s series, I tried for 2 days and it keeps crashing, it has a bug, and should be fixed. I can't even complete the profile setup, it won't continue the process! Its very bad app | Everything works quite good. I had a problem with recognizing my face from the front camera in order to change password. I had to take a picture only of the top part of my face to let me take the picture. | Awesome works well for me | Nice app ...works well easy to use nice design .. no issues | EXCELLENT customer service, so easy to use... win win. | Good investment | Changed bank here full time. No issues. | Amazing app | The app is very quick to respond and I can't think of anything that could be improved upon. | Works well for me, no issues | So far it's working well and I hope it continues | Awful. Absolutely awful. Need to selfie for pin but the camera button won't take photo. Not does the email with verification code come through. You're supposed to be easier than high street banks but you make my life misery with this woeful app and card. | Very simple to use. | I'm very satisfied, very useful and easy with adding money via GPay Also the money converting is so good. Cheaper than wise and instant. Amazing. | The best money app ever. | Love it. Big time help | This is a great card for securely purchasing online, currency exchange, for use when travelling to non Euro countries and day to day transactions. The so is also easy to use. | I tried to verify my account and got rejected 8 times already. Why is that? | Easy to use and so convenient | Great experience and ease of use definitely recommend.. great features available too if needed | Fairly good | I like, but the taxes of crypto are big | I was asked to change my passcode since then nothinhg works. The customer care is useless, they are passing the ball to each other One asks me to clear my cache, when he realizes that doest work, directs me to somebody etc. Like a circle. Not to mention that nobody answered my question properly regarding some items I see on my account. | If TAX ID will be mandatory i think i will take to minimal usage of Revolut services or erase the account. I don't want to give more official papers. The gov. can see that i make economies from my salaries and they will tax ( somehow) again what they already taxed . RIP freedom. | Great account for holidays, using the currency of whatever country you Re in | Cannot finish registration flow. App is crashing on the residence permit sharing step. Device: Sony XQ-DQ72. Upd: Fixed by app reinstall. | I just LOVE Revolute!! It's such an easy to use app, can add or transfer money in the blink of an eye, send money to the kids or pay for things if you don't have cash! I also LOVE the vaults!! You can see yours savings, adding your spare change on is ingenious and can quickly build up, plus it's accessible! I had a small issue with a card and got such quick action on the Chat! It's all around a brilliant app. I bet the banks are raging they didn't think if it first!! | Great service and easy to use. | Good to all | Smooth | Brilliant for spending overseas! Just works in so many ways!! | So far so good, hope it continues like that. | Perfect app | No hassle to date | It doesn't work. Impossible to take a picture of my ID | I lost all datas | Very easy to use | Not working. App is forcing me to update passcode but throwing only errors when doing so. Got stuck and unable to access my money. | Perfect | Amazing app,love the fetures. | fantastic | Scam. I sent 50$ worth of crypto to Revolut. Revolut refused to accept the transaction because it came from in their eyes a non-approved exchange. On bitcoin deposit page they only state it must be bitcoin network nothing else. Then they said they will return it without fees and after all I received 20$ back. So I lost 30$ in seconds just because of Revolut. | Great set of features would like to see more crypto currencies listed | A very good experience with Revolut. Love the challenges and options for kids to prioritize savings goals. | Perfect just needs offline use for taking money out of vault and a vault that you can put money in and cant until a certain date | Excellent way to do banking. | Great alternative card | Very good app , | Works great for me - single use cards, free transfers between users, etc. I like it. | New customer and app crashes every time when attempting identify verification - very frustrating. | Newest version crashing all the time but I can't seem to stop it running in the background and notifying me everything few hours | Great one. Easy to use | Working fine. Nice look and feel | Great features and the support is very helpful | Very usefull for me thanks revolut | Reliable, good security ( though a little improvement), variety of services and customer friendly. A reliable banking system you can trust. | The Best of the best!!!!!! | Great Banking app. Easy to use | Works well, no problems so far | Nice and easy to use | excellent so far | Overall pretty good and useful. Problematic when used for Steam and Google Play Store purchases - crashes on checkout. Somewhat misleading when looking at contacts - it appears all my contacts have Revolut Account... | ✌️✌️✌️ | How the hell am i supposed to take a picture with the front camera if it's scratched and i can't switch to use the rear camera, i'm not gonna replace my screen just to be use revolut, i'd rather switch to a different app. | Perfect | Very excellent service | So far so good | Revolut is nice | Haven't really used it, but so far so good. | An app for life I think 👍 | Good | Wirklich ich verstehe nicht wie diese app geht, aber es ist super | There's a bug which doesn't allow me to progress further than the ID checker (passport, driving licence etc.) during account creation. I'm also confused by how the referral code works, I signed up that way by giving my number. I then proceeded to the app and thought I could sign in but I was wrong so I went to sign up with the same number. Will the referral code still be registered if I sign up? | Awesome thanks | You can open account in just 30min❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ | I can't finish my registration because the app closes when I select the document type. (S23+) | It's just a good bank overall 😌 | U guys are great!! | The app keeps shutting down at the moment of document verification. | nice 🙂 | Easy to use really good for holiday | Crashes during ID verification | Great experience however i upgraded to metal and payed first instalment and i haven't recieved any kind of confirmation or tracking information on the deal. | fabulous | Amazing. | You guys are the worst! You ask for too much information and a picture of my official documents and a video and yada yada... What on earth is this bs? | excellent | It crashes every time I install a new app... I don't even know why it listens to app installs. | Ok | This app is a must if you are travelling!!!! Me and my boyfriend both use it and have never had issue, it's a safer way to spend and helps us both control our money! | Excellent communication. My card arrived on time. | Easy to understand and navigate x | i love it | Everything just works well | Easy to use and can change to any currency in seconds | Excellent | Very good | Excellent | Unable to register | Using it to travel, shopping.great bank. | Probably one of the best banking apps/services I've ever had the pleasure of using. Though I still am against the redesign.. | Fast,reliable and very comfortable 😌 to use | So far so good 👍 | Friendly user, i love it | Extremely good payment card | Great app | digital ident not possible app crashes whenever i select passport, id or drivers licence | Best ever i enjoy it at maximum | Perfect","{""1"":73294,""2"":15931,""3"":40394,""4"":329426,""5"":2274544}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Revolut Ltd","4839729021595729654","feedback@revolut.com","https://www.revolut.com/","7 Westferry Circus,

Is keep asking me to register for a new card. I used to have a card that doesn't work anymore. I registered already for 5 cards and the message is the same every time ""register for a new card"". Absolutely rubbish. I deleted the app twice already and no avail. | When I moved to another phone I cannot access my Kaufland card. Loops on generating the card.

There is a Shopping list function, where I can prepare my lost of needed items in advance. In my nearest Kaufland at Briz bl., the parking lots are comfortable, and it's easy to maneuver through the parking zone, without swearing words 😀. Which is now rarely happens if compared to e.g. Lidl or, Metro or Grand Mall's parking. | Very nice and cool | First time I gave 5*. After update they have forgotten your dates and you must login again. Imagine if fb or other app did that, how would you feel.. How can you change your password inside the app? Worse!! 1 star is too much!!! Uninstall - Adios muchacos! Your answer is off topic. I don't have problems with login. I have a problem I have to login every time you update the app. And this is happening when I try to pay and usually are 4..5 people behind me. | I like to shop in Kaufland!

The only feature I really miss is the ability to export a receipt in csv or any other format I could parse later. | You can't opet the catalog in the app, the bar code is almost impossible to scan, the points you get are useless because the products offered for the points are awful. Only good thing is the extra discount u get for using the card. | Great.

To get worse the imprint states this app is owned by kaufland Bulgaria?! | Nu poți să îți activezi cardul. Aplicația este dezvoltată cel mai probabil de niste indieni școliți in ale IT ului pe YouTube, in timpul liber. | I already have an account. but it always fails when registering for the card. I've also signed up for a card, but after clicking ok, it always goes back to mainpage. It's so complicated and not simple to sign up 2 times just for the same company. Can't you just make it simple? Sign up, and you got AUTOMATICALLY digital card? It's almost 2024 cmone! Don't make it complicated and too much action. | Брошурата не зарежда в 9 от 10 случая. Трябва да чакам половин минута на страница, а интернетът ми е 100Mbs. И не мога да я изтегля. Пълен боклук е този ап. | I can't connect to my account. I can't write my email,it doesn't let me to write. | They don't provide customer service to ask questions to resolve issues. I don't know why they promote DHL while Hermes is more reliable. Also, it was very important to me to buy router for internet, my time is getting wasted, but their customer service has not done a single good thing to reply. Update: I contacted through both ways: filling out contact form and calling on the phone number provided, neither worked. | Oribila! | Sorry but this is the worst app I have seen. I have really made my best and gave new and new attempts including deleting cache and data but without success. Issues I have experienced: logging off and leaving me at the cash desk with no possibility to use and recover it (returning errors), later not able to register to the K-card - WHY the card is not part of the account? After completing all the required data, I was not able to proceed and display it. I recommend to rebuild the app from scratch. | After the last update lost all the data, all points. App asks me to register for k card which I had, but then I enter my login info it just refreshes the page and asks again if I want to sign up for card Upd: it's been a month and nothing changed, same problems | Nu merită 2 bani | nu m a lasat doamna de la kaufland sa platesc cu oferta si m a jignit | In general the app works well. My problem is that I already have an old physical card and I have tried to add it to the app. The message I get after entering the number is ""this card has already been assigned"". I have no idea what that means but I cannot see the physical card in the app and the points do not change. I asked in one of your stores and although they tried the result was the same. Why can't I see the old card in the app? | I am not able to create a digital kaufland card from this app | This app is dead! About a week ago I wanted to use it and noticed that it logged me out. I tried to log back in but it's impossible. It's all messed up. I even tried to register anew but nothing works. I have no other choice but to remove it cause it's useless now. It always worked bad, always had problems with the self-check and the scanner, but now it just stopped working altogether. I even tried to reinstall it, but it's no use. Big disappointment! | Almost everything available | Funktioniert nicht. Account ist da aber Karte lässt sich nicht anzeigen, ""register now"" - wenn man klickt passiert gar nix. Beim Versuch die TelNr im Profil zu ergänzen ""there is already an account connected to this number"" - wer hätte das gedacht?? Antwort: Chrome ist installiert. Das Problem ist dass diese Applikation zwar mein Profil hat, aber die Karte nicht verknüpft!!! | If there is too much text on coupon detail, button is out of screen and its not possible to scroll. Please fix. Besides that its solid. | A helpful app to check leaflet, your receipts, your digital card to cover your shopping needs. | Pentru a beneficia de niste amarate de reduceri de 30 de bani, ca sa faci card de loialitate la Kaufland aparent este nevoie de adresa, apartament, date de nastere etc. Bine ca nu faceti si factura pe mail. Ce gluma de aplicatie. La alte magazine poti face card pe site web doar cu numele, numarul de telefon si mail. | The app has some issues while scanning. While it works for most of the cases, there are some where K-SCAN increases the value of the product. I got this experience when weighting some fruits. The printed price is different from K-SCAN. At self-checkout the in-shop scanner got the correct price. I still got the test cases. Please let me know if you need them so you can investigate the problem. | Plusy - Aplikácia je prehľadná a jednoduchá. - Bločky v elektronickej podobe. Mínusy - Vetu o aplikácii kupónu by som dal väčším písmom na začiatok zoznamu kupónov. Teraz je to na konci a stráca sa to v množstve malých písmeniek. - Chýba vyhľadávanie v ponukách. - Nedá sa nastaviť, aby boli bločky iba v elektronickej podobe (bez papiera). | 1000 times registered card 0 results | Its aight | I use it almost every time I shop at Kaufland. What I like a lot is the digital receipts. You could add a simple feature. If a user taps an item on a receipt the item is automatically added to the shopping list. | The greatest BUG of all : ""The brochure could not be loaded "" i'm having this problem since a few mounths . LE: Still the same problem . Eviroment : (Oppo reno 6 pro , android 13 , ColorOs 13 . | The leaflet isn't loading, since last weak | It won't let me change first and last name in the app, useless | For one month I can't see next week offers despite it is Sunday today! | Good job having google certificate so I can log in to the app since you allow that. Yes that's sarcasm. Avoid this app if you can. Go to a different store. | Modesta, sunt oferte in aplicatie la care nici nu vede prețul din cauza butonului 'Activeaza"" | Mega slow loading. | Na ja, undurchsichtige App... Manche Angebote werden vom lokalen Warenhaus akzeptiert, andere nicht. Mit den Coupons könnte man ein wenig sparen wenn man sich viel Zeit nimmt und diese alle vor dem Einkauf markiert. Auch diese werden nicht immer anerkannt. Die Gutschrift von Bonuspunkten ist undurchsichtig und inkonsistent. Auch der Umrechnungsfaktor in EUR ist unklar. Manche Produkte werden mit Bonuspunkten günstiger. Nicht gerade diejenigen die man braucht... Also eher eine Bauernfänger App. | I love it! | Can not input date of birth on registering for Kaufland card - Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro | Възможно ли е да добавите ""Търсене"" в приложението? Например при аналогичното приложение в LIDL има такава възможност. | App is useless, card doesn't work | Излишно усложнено и неефективно. След много подробна регистрация не можах да се добера до картата | Bad and slow. Many times at the cash desk the card icon doesn't show up and first wants to update my data, practically unusable at that moment at cash desk. | Kscan functionality was way better when it was still a separate app | New version lacks the Digital Receips for past purchases, so for me is useless. | This app is absolutely not working since the new version after 5 September 2023. I even can not enter in my account. There is no worth to keep it. Even after giving a feed back to the Kaufland support by the phone one week ago, there is still no change and the app is still not working. I am very disappointed of such poor app support. P. S. : I've done more than your recommendations may be 20 times or more already and the app is still blocked. I even can not enter my user name or password. | The app is fine, personal in some shops have to be more polite. | It seems the app will occasionally get blocked by Google Apps since there seems to be an issue with the login security or something. And that will log you out and soft bann you making it impossible for you to log in into the app and use any of the functions including the card. This is now the second time this has happened and it's really not fun when it happens during your checkout process in the store... | -1 not 1 | You have problems with the application? Try to fix. Quick! Sorry, but still not work. When I try to open my account, don't want to open. The problem is since yesterday. My account works only on the pc. Your appologizes not help me. You complicate the problem. Try to fix. | Useless for paying using ""kaufland pay"" with my mobile. The app kept crashing while trying to generate the code. I even connected to the kaufland wifi network. I had to leave my groceries behind and go home. 😤 | Cannot even open the app after the last update. Keeps crashing while starting | След последният ъпдейт приложението постоянно крашва при стартиране. Нужно е да го стартирам 5-6 пъти, за да заработи нормално, и всички дигитални касови бележки изчезнаха. | When it required an update, suddenly i had no acount anymore and my mail ""wasn't in the system"". I created a new one but then it didn't accept date of birth. Well if they don't want me as a customer, then fine, the feeling's mutual. | a dark mode of some sort would be appreciated but other than that i an satisfied! 💜 | Very useful app. However : lately there's been an issue - products are NOT put into proper categories! When I sort products in my wishlist by categories, they are not correct. Almost ALL products are in one and the same category, e. g. different foods and drinks (cheese, alcoholic drinncs, waffles, etc) are under ""Electric appliances, media"". Too busy to add them where they belong? Down one star for this inconvenience. | Payments missed | broken login | Aplikace se sama odhlašuje. (To jsem psal před 3 roky a stále stejné. Po každém updatu, abych se přihlašoval znovu). | Von einem Tag auf anderen waren alle digitale Kassenzettel sowie Treuepunkte weg. Eine Option den Fehler zu melden habe ich in der App auch nicht gefunden =( | Overall good application with critical issues. Using K-scan it often crashes when you do the checkout at the till. Funny thing - when you reopen the app it shows a tiny icon with number (of items in your shopping cart) at K-scan. But there is no way to get back to your shopping cart, as clicking on K-scan gives you 2 options: to use current supermarket or to choose different one. With either your cart is reset! | It forgets the coins | Изхвърли ме от акаунта ми преди десетина дни, не мога мануално да въведа картата си, връща ме в меню ""register"" и не ми работи дори пластиката. Опитах всичко! Беше прекрасно приложение.Проблемът е масов и продължи твърде дълго. | I lost my points because of failure. | Last time my comment was somehow deleted. Ive got the app since 2022 I did it on a whim on my phone with generated Instant Pass, after that crush many have complaint. I can't log in, all my points are Lost for good I've tried to create another account alas the app is crushing and doesn't let me proceed!? | Cannot copy text from offers and coupons. Very slow app, unstable, offen crashing and restarting. | Wow, Kaufland actually managed to completely screw up the app with recent update. As an example, if you use English (or Slovak) language, and want to view your orders, you will be shown a German agreement of some sort where you need to agree to it in German. I also apparently lost my account and all my points. | I can not sign in my account. It directs me to chrome but the page doesn't work | Niciodată nu se găsesc la raft produsele cu discount din aplicație, deci aplicația este inutilă | It was a beautiful gesture from kaufLand. About 20 days ago we had a newborn and we called him Adam, so they sent us a lot of gifts with a bathrobe with his name written on it. Thank you very much for your kindness and wish you always well | App crashes every single time I open. GG. Nice work. | It keeps crashing. I installed it several times agaim ant it crashes all the time. It was fine untill today... | След ъпдейт на приложението не мога да си вляза в акаунта защото не си знам паролата..когато ползвам методът ""Forgot password"" изписва, че на телефонен номер трябва да получя съобщение с код за верификация, но такъв не идва. Телефоният номер е коректно попълнен. | След последната актуализация има много проблеми с приложението. Обикновено работи идеално, но съм установил напоследък, че макар да работи вкъщи, не работи в магазина в Кюстендил. Цяла седмица мъка, защото държа списъка за пазаруване в приложението, но като не работи... ужас. Получих бърз отговор от разработчика, надявам се скоро да се отстрани проблемът. Създава неприятности не само на клиентите, а и на касиерките, които работят толкова усърдно. Стискам палци | I've used the app via my Google account. However, currently there is no authorisation to log in with my Google account after the last update. | Боклук пълен | Fast jedes Mal funktioniert die App an der Kasse nicht oder fragt nach einem Login, was natürlich aufgrund der blockierten Internetverbindung funktioniert nicht | Скапано приложение като магазина скъпа и гадна стока. | I give this rating to the application for forced update at the moment when I am standing at the cash register and want to show the cashier a barcode. After that I was unlogged from the app altogether. Thank you, great solution! | Rundom unlog,and defecate to log in. | The app logged me out and when I logged back in, all my data was missing, including card, receipts and bonus points | Prihlaska do sourezi je moc komplikovana , mam zadat vsechni udaje ktere appliance vi dohromady vymaže všechno kdy zkouším ""paste"" Id karty A ted' ještě mám znovu se přihlásit na pokladně do aplikace, parada | Worst app ever! I do not recommend it. | No points after online purchases in Marketplace. No possibility to add a receipt after a purchase. | Totálně nahovno UI, ani se mi tam nejde přihlásit. | Te deloghează des și accesul la 'cardul kaufland' in loc sa fie unul simplu si cat mai la îndemână, mereu e alterat de promotii si termeni si conditii și altele popupuri care apar înainte. | Application does not work for some reason. I can't log in. I have to register again and lose my points. | ,y , 'r, | Tak v jednom případě z 10 funguje jak má. Jinak pořád nějaké chyby, něco nefunguje, už tolikrát jsem musela načíst celý košík znovu, a když se mi podaří zaplatit Kaufland Pay tak to je zázrak! Proč musí být zaplé notifikace, aby šlo platit K. Pay? A skener sotva načítá i dobře viditelné kódy (a není to foťákem, neboť aplikace Globusu to zvládne na stejném mobilu bezvadně a rychle). Doufám, že to vývojáři zlepší. | Putin dezamagit... Am card de mai bine de 2 ani la kaufland, dar dupa ce mi-am facut cont in aplicatie n-am gasit un loc unde sa adaug cardul pe care-l am deja... doar sa fac altul nou | whats the purpose of birthday coupons when the stuff is not available in the store? 🙄 | Cannot even login. Want to use Google login and only get Google error saying that their app is blocked. Made in Germany at its best. | Nu va merge serveru Never, stergeti carduri active de dragu sa nu putem sa ne bucuram de bonusuri... sunteti de toata jena. Iar bonusurile/ premiile musai prin aplicatie, nu sunteti capabili sa le dati si prrin hartii/ coduri care sa fie scanate la casa, ca sa fie obligat oricine sa isi puna tampenia voastra de aplicatie, desi s-a plans lumea ca sunteti vai mama vostrA la acest capitol. RUSINE!!!! NU VA MERGE SERVERU CE DUMNEZEU NU INTELEGETI???? sept 2023: pt a cata oara imi stergeti cardul!!! | Не мога да се регистрирам Не работи | Doesn't work at all, pictures of the coupons just won't load and the app is therefore absolutely unusable for me. | Error 503 service temporarily unavailable | За да се възползваш от даден купон, те задължават да пазаруваш определен брой пъти в магазина въпреки, че човек има натрупани голям брой точки. | The leaf is not loaded,always. There is a message something like that Try again later | best | Non stop it not let me sing in in my account bad app | Very confusing UI. The leaflet / brochure never loads and just shows retry. | don't even start.... | Pictures aren't displayed always and this makes it hard to identify items with coupons despite having active mobile data connection or connecting to Wifi. The sorting of the items is bad and is very hard to find. It takes lot of time to scroll throught the different sections to find the exact product. The app is buggy and lags a lot | I was excited about the K-SCAN option, unfortunately, I had a very bad experience with it. An internet connection is required at all times, but there's no reception at the store in my area because of all the metal and no windows. The store does offer free wifi, but it's shaddy at best, with constant interruptions. I couldn't finish the process. Maybe offer an offline option? | I cannot for the love of God log in to my app because an unexpected error occurs apparently every time I try to log in via Google Account, this sucks majorly!!! | Two things: 1) Prices for many items in marketplace are different in app and browser - in app they are higher. 2) In marketplace some items are mislabeled, and if you want to buy something A3, and it says in the title A3, you receive A5. After complaint they claim it was A5 all along and update the title on website to counter your claim. When caught cheating - they offer 50% off next same purchase. Otherwise, as a helper for shopping in the store is really good, but avoid marketplace. | Worst app i've ever seen. I have to connect every time I use kscan. | Good app | Trash | bad app, always jump on home page, almost zero imformation | After latest update app logged me out and I cannot login. Lost all my progress, had to make new account. App developers should be sacked.

I have to physically click on my phone for both operations. It sucks. Otherwise, I have no problem with the app. In fact, it's been my default editor and recorder for a while now"",""I love this app!

I love capcut!"",""I love using this app for video editing, however, I've come across a recurring issue recently. When I export a project, the video has no audio for the last few seconds. I've checked CapCut, the audio is still there, I've even tried re-exporting the project, that didn't work. I hope this can be looked into, as it's been bugging me for about 2 weeks now. Thank you in advance! :)"",""Until the most recent update this was the most economical and uset friendly editing app out there imo. Now it's a mess. Reverse chops up anything you try to use it with, the, lag, despite having plenty of memory and storage space and no running background apps is making it almost impossible to accurately and precisely edit. Issues with sound lining up, minor bugs with beats settings, and it takes an ungodly amount of time to apply settings when added or on opening a project.

"Telegram","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices.

One of the worst app i had ever seen👎 | I love pintrest | I really like this app, it's one of my favourites but unfortunately I can't give it 5 stars because logging in through Facebook isn't working and that's the account I use :/ | it's good..✨ | I miss the old Pinterest; before the algorithm change and ai running everything. There's less actual profiles and more junk. Ads are on the borderline of harassment. I want 2020 era Pinterest . If you click something it takes over your entire feed. Often it's the same 10 peoples profiles and the rest is ai digital art and fake profiles wanting you to click links. | Sweet app | Love it! | After last update lots of videos never play! Update: cleaned up storage and memory, and app still getting worse... slower play and slower loading | Good | EWyyy the greatest app✨✨ | make ai searchin feature better otherwise it's a perfect app. | Pinterest is really everything! | Nice! | This app has everything I need, from edits to tutorials, fashion inspiration vice versa. They recently added ads and I'm kinda disappointed. | I have no idea what happened, but for some reason I can't see who replied to my comment anymore, or what it was. When I go to check it's only ""Pins inspired by you!"" Or ""We think you might like these 15 ideas"" or the worst one, ""______ commented on Pins you've saved"" which is basically useless.... | My number one priority | It's a great app and I have it on my chromebook but I use a different acount and I need to enter my email and my password when I want to use it but after a certain amount of time it tells me that it has been locked due to suspicious activity | Beat | Your app suddenly stopped working. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times so far but can not get the app to work. I constantly see the gear wheel going round and round. This has been going on for about 3 months. I am very disappointed and can no longer use this app. | Cool 😎 | Very good experience while using this...This new kind of update is so perfect | This application helps me a lot for both purposes and so on I advise you to download it but there is something missing to add | Good | I love it<<🇰🇷 | Sometimes it works properly but sometimes it doesn't not login ... sometimes no picture were seen 😕😕😕😕 disappointed | Unbelievable .. It's Really Good Images & Clearity 💯Trusted | Ah.. well I just love it tbh | Perfect | I have this one person I followed a while ago, the user is not online anymore and I try to unfollow the user but it doesnt let me, I even blocked but it doesn't remove the user from my following list. It follows automatically when i refresh the page | An excellent app I can not do without it | That is a nice app and that's in so nice pictures looking a very good | Great app. Has a variety of stuff from food and drink to fashion and building. Share with and send messages to friends. | Extremely great experience with such innovative ideas | Pinterest is on of the helpful app i want that you all try it .thanks pinterest for helping me❤ | very helpful and interested app | 👍👍👍 | Very easy and quick | I'm getting notification on notification bar but when I click them nothing shows up and in notification section also things are not updated. After updating this app I can't see the previous notification like before. Please do something about it 🥺 | Love my Pinterest!♥️ | Good app, but sometimes it glitches. For instance, I'll be scrolling through some images and all of a sudden one of the images will be cropped halfway and another image will appear on the other half and it will be slanted. It typically happens when i leave the and then come back on. I find it very strange and I hope it will be fixed soon since I had this problem in around January, and despite all the updates, this still hasn't been fixed. | Love this app | When I see crochet patterns and it says free pattern I can't print it out or find it. | Pal ji 😈 🙏 | Very nice app | like it | There is something wrong with Pinterest. A few days ago I could use it fine, but now when I try to log in from my laptop it says connection is not secure. This has been happening after I unsubscribed Pinterest from Gmail. When I tried to download the app on phone it showed there was no internet connection, although the internet was fine. It has been glitching a lot, and it's getting frustating bacuase I need to log in for work. Please fix it as soon as possible, thank you. | After loving this app for years, the barrage of ads in every single page now makes it an epic disappointment. | 😭🍓 | It's more ad than content. It's really disappointing. | Good app | Wow super this app is good looking 🙏🔥 Trends my channel so, thank you pinterest App... | Good. Love this app. Thanx | Pins are repetitive, features like AUDIO IS NOT SUPPORTED IN YOUR LOCATION is annoying, saving pins but save and share POPS in is also annoying. So i can't find what the developers are polishing in this app. I hate also when i click a pin from YouTube and instantly the YouTube video playsl. | This made my work easy | Çan always find what I'm looking for and more. | جيد | Better application for Home Design and Maps. | I love it | Enjoy the app and learned a lot so far. | Me encanta la App,pero quiero q en las reacciones tambien se pueda reaccionar con un ☹️ o 😓 ya q algunos usuarios hacen pines bien sad, y cada vez q veo uno triste tengo q reaccionar con un ♥️ o 😯 xfavor hagan eso Edit: Ahora en la nueva actualizacion hay no se q cosa q guarda los pines durante 30 dias y despues no se q pasa... No me gusta!!, 1. Una vez q toco la palabra ""pines creados por mi"" entonces ya no se puede cambiar a favoritos. 2. Despues tengo q buscar mis pines creados otra vez 😤 | Good and nice | It's good | Good | It is very much good and informative app I like it too much | Amazing | Good for craitivity | Mast App | Best app ever I have seen | Great Experience | I just start using this app, i don't know how it work | I hope that you can add a function in which we can download video.Plzz add this option and I hope that you can provide ads on asia region too.i have tried pinterest on American server but it have way too much ad while there are no ad on asia server at least not on my I hope that pinterest can earn and grow quickly with the help of ad but don't add too much ads on also.I have a new problem in which there are 2 layers of pin in home feed. I have a screenshot too. | Ok | It is the worst it doesn't wasn't me to sign in | Super ap👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 | Birbal Tudu | Nice 💝💝 | Very good amazing thanks 😊 | I always find many amazing things, ideas, interesting new knowledge, helpful tips and even answers if I have questions about certain things. All around, this App is absolutely awesome! I could not, recommend this App enough! 😊💯,% 👍👏👏 | Worst app | One of my favourite apps but suddenly i can't download images. I've tried reinstalling for a 5th time and still nothing. And the *help* they provide is not much of a help whatsoever. | I love everything abt this app. The pinning, the liking, the saving to boards. It just fills me with joy omg | Mohamedyayo | It's An amazing app provides very valid and useful information luv it | Always love to look at Pinterest always interesting and colorful and informative | It does not work | Good | It was great | Nice | that's cool | Excilent | Idk why this app has to be updated every month it gets stuck | When I try to search for a specific thing, it just gives me a totally different result than I asked for. Please remove any updates that you think might be causing this problem. | I love Pinterest really awesome | Rewlly love it | I have this app and always loved it, I save all kinds of pictures for ideas and can find almost any idea on it, it's great!! | thisnis the best wallpaper | FILLED with ads omg | nice | favorite app ever! | Nice | Very useful and good app | Best app using from past 6 years ❗ | How about making it so that you don't accidentally send a pin to a random stranger when downloading one?? | Most useful application | Too many ads Oh | I use Pinterest all the time for saving photos and watching videos! The only thing I don't like is that everytime I click different pins, it keeps me out of the app. Also, I want to see people's background picture for their profile on the Pinterest app (if you know what I mean) but other than that I rate 9/10 for pinterest 😀👍 | Fantastic app to choose pictures of your choice | I'm addicted to this app | It's the best application ever. I pour myself in it the whole day | Splendid | Very nice app I like most wow 😧 | Wonderful variety and tons of information | Ok | I like that I can find any kind of recipe for any type of diet, there are encouraging scriptures, regular posts of encouragement, motivation, comfort, etc, wallpaper for ur cell, anything I have imagined so far is on Pinterest. | Nice app rated 50000000000 | I LOVEEEEE PINTERESTTTTT‼️‼️ But I have one issues with my deactivated account. I don't know what I do and then I just found out that my accounts has been deactivated. I haven't got the account yet. I have reported it to Pinterest but no response!

Neni preplacana tisicem featur, ktere pouziva tak 1% uzivatelu a nevyskakuji na me na kazdem screenu 3 raklamy jako napriklad v katastrofalni aplikaci od Monety. Prosim jen o pridani featury potvrzeni hromadnych plateb v telefonu. Myslim, ze pro hodne podnikatelu, kteri resi 90% businessu na telefonu by to bylo vysvobozeni. Takhle se platby zpozduji, protoze musim lezt do webove verze a to je opravdu opruz. | With George, there's no dull moment, always fun with George . | Excellent Services | Great app, great bank. They really try to make it user-friendly but it's also secured. | Better without key | Works great | Aplikace funguje hezky, je přehledná rychlá. Ale jak prosím zruším notifikace týkající se finančního zdraví? Opravdu je nechci vidět co dva dny v systému, ideálně ani v aplikaci. Hledám pod ikonou profilu, bohužel nikde žádnou volbu/položku Tipy od George nevidím. | Fast and easy | Good | Kompletně funkční, rychlá, spolehlivá a moderní. Maximální spokojenost. | Great tool | Good | Access to the app is blocked by some sketchy form. So I can not access my account through this. | Tato aplikace je strašná.Naprosto chaotické umístění funkcí (např. umístění zaplaceni přes QR někomu a naopak platba od někoho přes QR jsou v úplně jiné části;proklikat se na autorizovaný hovor je čistý horor, misto aby jako v normální appce toto bylo na 2 kliknuti).Po zaplaceni na internetu a potvrzeni v George nelze aplikaci ukončit a kliknuti na ukončení vyžaduje prihlaseni do bankovnictví.Vynucování George jako jediné autorizační aplikace mitiguje vrstvu ochrany (2 oddělená zařízení). | very good | Still like this app. Unfortunately had to move from Czech, but that was a good experience. Thanks developers | All you need at the tip of your finger | A special update to be able to put on the rainbow icon?! The question arises, does the development team really not have more important things to do? | Osm app | Dneska už víceméně použitelná aplikace. | úprava s nejčastějšími kontakty při odeslání platby někam zmizela. jelikož tuto featuru používám docela často,opět měním hodnocení P.S. pokud kliknu na New transfer -> manual transfer -> dostanu se na seznam kontaktů pro odeslání platby. V poli ""most used contacts"" mám random kontakty, které jsem využila třeba jednou v živote, místo toho, abych tam měla kontakty které využívám docela často. Již jednou se tato sekce opravovala a fungovala jak má. Teď je to zas rozbitý | Good app | It is ok | I think the app has improved so significantly since I first started using it. Nowadays, it's very intuitive and I am very glad that klic and George are now combined into one. It's much less of a hassle when trying to approve a payment. | Awesome 👍🏻😎 dekujeme | Dvě velké špatné: Při potvrzování platby není zobrazen variabilní a specifický symbol. Aplikace uživatele odhlašuje po velmi krátké době neaktivity bez možnosti tuto dobu prodloužit. | Всё круто | Velmi dobré | Good | Naprosto tragický produkt, vše špatně, nepřehledné, nemožnost najít cokoliv. Zkouším několik let se v něm vyznat, ale nejde to, a každé jejich ""zlepšení"" je jen zhoršení už tak uživatelsky nepřívětivého produktu! Jsem u ČS přes 30 let, ale kvůli nesmyslnému Georgi budu nucena přejít do jiné banky. Otřesné, jak dokáží uživatelům znepříjemnit život 😕 | New version 23.46.9 keeps randomly crashing, all previous ones worked well. | Satisfactory | Excellent | Skvělá aplikace. Jednoduché a intuitivní GUI. Žádné zbytečnosti. | Perfect. Just love how easy it is to work in this app. | Wonderful so far | V nove verzi prestal spravne fungovat scan qr kodu. Musim s telfonem hybat a otacet (jine qr scannery kod nactou). Pak nejaky chytrolin vymyslel, ze nastavi defaultni realizaci platby pri scanovani qr podle data splatnosti. Takze chcete zaplatit faktury a surprise mothefu***rs! platby odejdou az za 14 dnu. | Aplikace George je pro milovníky trénování pevných nervů. Je šíleně pomalá, při načítání samotné appky a při dívání se na logo G byste zvládli zhlédnout všechny série Her o trůny (a pomalým zařízením to nebude). Kvůli 'bezpečnosti' musíte při téměř každém tapnutí zadávat svůj PIN, což mi osobně přijde kontraproduktivní, je zde mnohem větší riziko, že si toho náhodný kolemjdoucí všimne. A pak.. jsem bez netu na mobilu, chci se přihlásit na PC. Aha. A jak, když přihlášení musím potvrdit na mobilu? | Pretty solid actually. The smoothest banking app I ever used | Perfect tool very happy | The bank that blocks your funds the second you need them | Excellent | Easy to use :) | Od doby, co ČS spojila ověř. klíč s Georgem je appka naprosté peklo - při zadání PINu opakovaně padá, potvrzení platby kartou může trvat klidně 10 minut jednoduše proto, že opakovaně spadne, následně je třeba podstoupit retardovaný zdlouhavý ověřovací proces, než se George tzv. opět nastaví, mezitím se platba zruší kvůli nezabezpečené autentizaci, následně ale George nabídne potvrzení utomaticky zrušené platby a můžete zahájit celý proces znovu. KWA udělejte s tím něco, nebo klíč opět oddělte. | Nice application. | Great I am very happy this app excellent | Very confusing interface. Slow AF. I'm looking forward to changes which will make even worse of course. | It works as I need | Very good app. Very functional and easy to use | S aplikací nejsou žádné problémy | It works. | Vcelku pěkné. Řazení karetních transakcí by mohlo být podle data provedení, speciální kategorie čekající na zaúčtování (na úplně zvláštní obrazovce) a samotné datum zaúčtování mě popravdě moc nezajímají, jen to vše znepřehledňuje. Raději bych jeden seznam s případnou poznámkou, pokud něco není zaúčtováno. | Naprosto neintuitivni a nesmyslna app :/ | Špatné, melze ani poslat platbu z účtu! Ani zobrazit a stáhnout historii v csv nebo xls. | Amazing and comfortable app | So far i do like this George app. Mainly that it's simple to use for someone who is not so much in nowadays technologies. Also, what I like about it is, that when i purchase some thing, the massage come immediately that i have made purchase. Plus the convenience of making payments, hopefully it will work from outside of euro-continent. | Good fast transaction | Excellent ⭐ | Perfektni servis!! | Excellent, easy and user friendly | Za mě super aplikace | The good one. I like it. | The app works okay, but still is missing a lot of functions, especially if you are coming from a bank that has very rich features like Tatra Banka Slovakia. George feels compared to Tatra Banka's app stuck in early 90s while their app is keeping up with current trends. For example: Why it's not possible to round up savings in % manner? Why am I able to put aside only 30CZK from every payment? I want to be able to put from every payment I make 20% aside, simply in George it's not possible... | Aplikace nefunguje korektně jako klíč, je-li otevřená, požadavek na ověření se nezobrazí. Nutno aplikaci zabít a znovu spustit. | Very good | By far the best mobile banking app, I tried out so far. | Works great in most of the time. Never had a problem with the app. | Chybí zobrazení blížících se plateb, a proto musím (chci) stále používat webovou verzi. Při verifikaci přihlášení přes web nejde rozumně odejít a vnucuje se přihlášení do appky. Také tam každou chvilku zdržují nějaké krásné animace, takže appka působí pomalá. Při poruše telefonu (v zahraničí) jde appku v novém zařízení rozběhnout až po telefonátu s podporou (dost si počkáte), takže jsem byl dočasně úplně odříznut od svých peněz. Jiné banky to mají vyřešené, takže nejde tvrdit, že to nejde. | Much better than in the past!!! | nepadá. za mě by mohla být přehlednější. | Every new update completely breaks everything and i have to re-log multiple times, rarely works without some issue | Pomalé, špatně UX, špatní vývojáři 😎 | zlatý George klíč. NECHCI bankovnictví v mobilu. Potvrzování přihlášení/plateb trvá hrozně dlouho, protože se startuje celý tenhle zbytečný kolos. | İt is a little bit slow but still it is very good | I think it is a decent app. Could be a bit faster when starting-up to confirm payment. And I just don't like passively forcing users to have banking app in their phones. Edit: You may not be aware of, but originally SMS were free of charge. I was told after they were no longer free, so I was passively forced to download your Key app, then to migrate to full online banking. Edit: Not safer, because I must now carry my banking access with me everywhere, and it takes just my finger to do everything | Safe, easy to navigate, best of the available. | Excellent | Smooth and easy transactions | Pretty easy and nice. Looks reliable | Very good! | Ok | Perfect bank out there | This application is pice of code. Worst bank application ever. Worst UI. Unfriendly interface. No required information. Even bank employee don't know how to find the info in this app. | it is constantly improved to be a realy handy banking up. I had no issues with it because it is similar to online banking I am used to | Perfect application, so easy . | ok | Very easy and bilingual. Branch staff at Chodov are very friendly too. | Otřesená aplikace, bohužel pokud nechcete měnit banku tak Vám nic jiného nezbývá | Cannot get it verified/confirmed through the app DoKapsy via Banking IDentity. It keeps failing and says it's not recieving data from the app. | Celkem bezva aplikace, prehledna apod, ale posledni dobou zacala posilat notifikace, treba pri pouziti karty, i kdyz je mam veskrze schvalne vypnute :/ | Fast, easy to use. Is intuitive if unsure as to procedures. | Aplikace stále závisí na George Klíč kterou nelze na vybrané telefony nainstalovat. Zdůvodnění je z důvodu bezpečnosti. Stejný operační systém jako Samsung a jiné. Jiné banky problém s bezpečností telefonů nemají. Bravo ČS. | Best | Bezva funkce ve všech směrech | Great banking app. Thank you George! | Excellent | Máte to zabugované. Když už aplikaci mám otevřenou / používám, a potřebuju v ní potvrdit prihlášení, okno se nezobrazí! Je nutné aplikaci vypnout a zapnout. Teď třeba nejde podepsat prohlášení, protože už v aplikaci jsem, a žádné potvrzení se neobjevilo. | Tohle je asi nejlepší aplikace, co jsem kdy viděl. Je prakticky dokonalá. A ne, nejsem najatej ani bot. | Děkuji za sloučení obou aplikace do jedne! | Chybí mi možnost zadat platbu QR kódem uloženým v telefonu, ne pouze jeho naskenováním kamerou. | 👁👅👁 | Funny application! I just have a new ceska sporitelna credit card, due to a contract transfer, but.. since I am not a czech citizen I cannot uae the app. | Please think about some additional security... I liked using 2 apps, because I was able to use different login method for accessing account data (biometrics is good) and better method for signing (6 digit PIN). Now I have to use the same method for just accessing account info as for signing which makes the method for signing much more vulnerable to attacks! | Líbila by se mi možnost organizace hlavního menu do složek. V případě vícero položek se může zdát nepřehledné. Jinak cajk | just great | Perfektni aplikace prozatim funguje skvele, pouzivam furt a porad funguje super. Je tam vse co potrebuju, a bankovnictvi na pocitaci jsem neotevrela ani nepomatuju, proste super. Porad se zlepsuje , pouzivam ho roky a porad je to sikovna aplikace. Miluju George | Samé chyby bránící založení účtu (technical error, chyba přesměrování), nejde kvůli tomu dokončit KYC. Nejde založit spořicí účet online, prý musím na pobočce? Čekal jsem upřímně víc 🙄 Edit: podařilo se po několika pokusech založit vkladový účet, po zobrazení dokumentů k podpisu a přesunutí aplikace na pozadí se do aplikace již nejde přihlásit, Something went wrong error 🙄 | Pomale a nacita se s chybama porad dokola | Stupid idea to force mobile banking on all users and to use insecure 1-factor authentication! Also why does my bank want to track my location and registering is not possible with location services switched off? Time to switch to a sensible bank. | I like it | Works 👍 great | Nice 👍 | Po aktualizaci George teď všechno běží pouze v jedné aplikaci, výborně! Dřív ten geoge klíč fungoval s velkým zpožděním. | When George and George Klíč were separated, everything worked great, but since 15/11/2023 they merged them in one app and now I am locked out, because I can't login to it, everytime I try to set up the new George authentication, it always fails with some random error. Thanks George for locking me out of my account. | Best bank app so far. No ads or offers clear overview o all products and all functions intuitively accessible. | Nechci mit George app na mobil. Hlavne to pouzivam domu na pocitace. Nutit tu appku na vase zakazniky je povazuji za spatnym krokem. | Sorry jako, ale dříve se SW před vypuštěním mezi lidi testoval. | Kvůli téhle aplikaci uvažuji po více ja 15 letech o nové bance. Upřesňuji: opravdu mi nepřijde rozumné, ba ani bezpečné, nosit úplný přístup k veškerým mým financím s veškerou a absolutní kontrolou nad nimi 24/7 v kapse. Dále mi velice vadí, že nutíte klienty k vlastnictví zařízení třetí strany k instalaci aplikace s výše zmíněným rizikem. | When I had to have George Klic with George, everything worked fine for me, but now when they moved both functionality to single app it broke for me. When I try to migrate George Klic to George, it would just print out some error message with message try again. And this is not the first time this happeneds. when George klic started it didn't worked on my phone, and I was forced to get new phone just to have access to my money. And now again. I'm considering switching bank | QR codes payments stopped working. The issue is present for over a month. | Normál bez problémů, zatím. | Velmi bych uvítal, kdyby v mobilní verzi bylo mezi čekajícími platbami vidět i trvalé platby, jejichž splatnost se blíží (tak jak jsou vidět ve webové vetrzi). Děkuji | Very customer friendly app | V Sony Xperia XA1 zmizel přehled plateb z kreditní karty. Po cca půl hodině se zase objevil. Nespolehlivé. | Bohužel aplikace neumožňuje spoustu věcí, které potřebuju, např. přidělovat dispoziční práva. Člověk musí v jednom kuse létat na pobočku a podepisovat papíry. Chtělo by to upgrade procesů. | Moje první připomínka byla vyslyšena tak to zkusím znovu. Před sloučením aplikací jsem k přihlašování do aplikace George používal biometrii ale k potvrzování v aplikaci George klíč ne. Přišlo mi to jako dobrý kompromis mezi bezpečností a pohodlností. Po sloučení jsem tuto možnost ztratil? Bylo by možné přidat do nastavení možnost zapnout biometrii zvlášť pro přihlašování a zvlášť pro potvrzování? Jinak považuji sloučení aplikací za velký posun. 👍 | Nejlepší internetové bankovnictví v porovnání s konkurencí. Rychlé, pohodlné a jednoduché. | Reklama na půjčku v přehledu produktů je rušivá a podlá. | Super. Everything has been working for me since I opened an account 10 years ago. | It's easy to use and very convenient. | Big, complex, and slow (sometime not functional)... on the other hand seems secure.... | neprehledny spatne funkcni program, objevuji se okna, ktera nejdou vypnout, CSas mi vnutila hruzu, co jsem nechtel. :( | Very, very good application | Easy. | It took almost 3 years (!) to implement payment key into George. Application devs, congrats! Amazing job so far. | Prehledna appka | Ugly UI and terribly unintuitive. Also, customer support will try to convince you that you need your location turned on at all times in order to be able to use the app. | Upravuji původní recenze, tak nevím, jak to bude vypadat... Aplikace každopádně nadprůměrná, uvítal bych ale možnost vytvoření QR kódu v sekci ""platba"" a dále možnost QR kod uložit, pouhá možnost ""sdílet"" je naprosto nedostačující. | Absolutně příšerně fungující aplikace. Jen George jako aplikace je důvod proč změnit banku. | Jen by bylo fajn kdyby se mě přestalo ptát na ohodnocení když už jsem hodnotil bůhví kdy dávno. | Abych se pomocí 2FA mohl přihlásit na webu banky na svém PC, musím uvnitř mobilní aplikace George složitě procházet různé sekce než dojde k samotnému ověření. Chtělo by to proces ověření zjednodušit. Jinak asi dobrá apka. | Easy to use | Perfect | noise | Hra je skvělá, až na to že, Minulý týden jsem hrál hru až osm hodin denně. Měl jsem i milující ženu, ale když mě hra začala přitahovat více než se zajímat o Sáru, odešla. Vzala i děti. A já zkrátka nevím co mám dělat. Každý den i noc probrečím. Sáro prosím vrať se domů. Já bez tebe nemohu žít. Jsi světlo mého života, Jsi tak krásná že i kapky deště se bojí poskvrnit tvou krásu, Jsi ta nejkrásnější ani Helena Trójská není tak půvabná jak ty. Já se změnil, tak prosím Sáro. | Byl jsem donucen nainstalovat si George, protoze George klic bude zrusen. Z bezpecnostniho hlediska naprosto nevhodne mit vse na jednom miste. Navic se ani nespusti pruvodce slouceni aplikaci jak udajne mel. | great experience | Easy to use and convenient for account access anywhere. | Great Service & very nice application... | Difficult to access from US, not all times reliable","{""1"":4386,""2"":712,""3"":1920,""4"":14924,""5"":115341}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Česká spořitelna, a.s.","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+spo%C5%99itelna,+a.s.","george@csas.cz","http://www.csas.cz",,"https://www.csas.cz/cs/zasady-zpracovani-osobnich-udaju","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+spo%C5%99itelna,+a.s.","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vhbP7CdNzYbWGMFO0F8dYEmTHXsreV2bilSaAzH3rhaybbXmsYqR4XKI70U0AVTOk6c","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0T6NQ2sEGR1iR8CftUk48mXAX3Opyw5k4MrijzRmw02Fjq8u-m5kDmw-9rnA0jABs4ZH","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dm1-x2O1Cuy2Dy2dBTfSG49kp8xXLsE-27Hicj9aVCzfYjQU8WBkDkeHCeNUoneY6Dw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/G1__6UyXqE9Xl9pu7BvooWKHUBViX_GTbjmUHMo20m32j3OIxjzvdQBnUYLBPDE-cR9g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/O4vxVm0bDiuzDTUlA5v-c6T3_UIn1mWEBmgEW_cvlalVXQ07veOtDUJNraKrCGMbfA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YNzALvgQzqQteQIqiZRLJFOi5OjD1iNtciETOf_hTwUpYfFpFJHhGcXbck4mU-2dcnU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FUd81DLar2XQRWIO6WQRw4ClRhWkW1DtWfzexk_NkkzRfOxbZbsmzPB2rRWKpH5R9A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FChb5PmMz_ffXRDOSf_i_gcQah3iouLnCg5AHj7ottDLM8pYOJ3g-V5CIc9LVPD22wYY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KY1AQpCpAHfRKdrg0UkrRlpd_0CplAzN5WwBmjaE4ehgR1rKOyCZ82lGm02sjlwBm10"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/--KTzRX_GGoK2-Pw0q5m3G9DlHP3QLRPWv3VI9WGczbCNcO22tNf4_4NXDsaYB42fS4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QNRSQC-K-vfNno9TKyLQ133gFSocB6ONGi1d_0eAQxde0ONtHpSE4oCzRy0WxSZCAA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vh5JWCnEd7NjfLJfBG76JsVdYWapFMQ6Pms0kiFyzYd8wyTh_LILxvnznuHAMF5qW3w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VxFiqo6gYakL0M6xF1k7pZ83lHqsB0xBOY4C40P8-I1-k5JJR6LDYezKTJOlE3g-cCM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PMsiDtrwo5knDJbUG2U_kJk42sRZm4QTGWbotGUshVY3bno_wOVJQxl2o5BzDR48M9vK"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rtWl0GFrcxcI92tXpqggFdP1nbOeAOf3HihIgQpYljlyFeOTGzPAA2_JmRilw8ucsPc0""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Apr 25, 2017",1708583401000,"24.02.9-google","For quicker orientation, you can find the contract number of all your insurance policies directly in the George overview without a single click.

Expected another necessary evil/bloat - got an actual working app | Easy to use | I can see only one of the three prepaid cards that I use, and there's no way to add the other two. Useless adware. | Za mě Super možnosti nabytí oproti konkurenci | Absolutely abysmal adware. Usefull for controlling your o2 services, but constantly spams advertising notifications without an option to opt out. I am already paying you so stop >:( | Aplikace je velmi jednoduchá na pochopení. vše je přehledné a srozumitelné. A o2 VÁM DÁ TŘI DNY 5G DAT ÚPLNĚ ZADARMO! Doporučuji všem co mají simku u o2. | some network eshuu | Asi to není chyba aplikace, ale spousta věcí tu nejde nastavit, ovládat atd Můžete si tu sjednat službu, zrušit už ne. Přístup O2 je na odchod, jenže není moc kam... | Vše přehledně dostupné. | Nejlepší operátor v ČR! | Good | Hrozný | 😍😍😍 | Na vyšší balík viem prejsť v aplikácii, ale na prechod do nižšieho musím volať na podporu, čo sa nezaobíde bez toho, aby sa mi nesnažili natlačiť ďalšie služby. Neetické obchodné praktiky sú dôvod prečo si aplikácia nezaslúži viac ako jednu hviezdičku. | Add notifications about unpaid bills, thx | Tak a znovu... Mám 100gb simku - horší připojení snad už nemůže být a pořád co 10-15 minut výpadek připojení. | Forcing updates. | Nemůžu se podívat kolik mi zbývá dat, protože mě aplikace nutí udělat update na Google Play, čímž si vyplýtvám další data. Chytré. Edit: Tomu rozumím, ale nemůžete je nutit aktualizovat a plýtvat jim tak placená data. Navíc žádná z přidaných funkcí není tak klíčová, aby bez ní aplikace nešla použít. Pokud ano, bylo by dobré to dát v aplikaci vědět. Takhle je uživatel (já) akorát naštvaný, že ho nutíte do něčeho, co v tu chvíli nepotřebuje a nechce. | Iks de | Dobrá aplikace. | Very nice. | Po aktualizaci se ukázalo, že budu muset na prodejnu, v ostatních ohledech je aplikace v pořádku, až to vyřídím a pokud bude vše fungovat tak klidně 5 hvězd | It is okay | Medky zlodějský | Ok | Nová aplikace je mnohem lepší než ta stará. | Svojí nespokojenost s touto aplikací musím vyjádřit znovu (minule kvůli hloupému systému správy mobilního internetu), ježto mi chodí SMS zprávy s informací, že mám na jeden den neomezená 5G data a mám si je tam vyzvednout. Nejen že moje propojené mobilní číslo ukazuje starý tarif, který už dávno nemá, ať jsem se díval kam jsem chtěl, data zdarma jsem nenašel. Škoda že nejde dát 0*/5, protože přesně to bych aplikaci udělil. Koneckonců mi ani neřekne, kolik dat mi zbývá nebo kdy se obnoví. | Apka je dobra, jen se mi nelibi, ze je nutna pro vyuziti vsech sluzeb, jenz platite. Nerad si zahlcuji mobil prehrselem zbytecnych aplikaci. | Chce hodnotit sotva sem to zap... | O2 is a scam, avoid them.

Tohle je taková levná aplikace. UX naprosto k h*vnu. | Nejdou vypnout upozornění na reklamní sdělení... | Black patterns to force people to accept tracking for marketting and not just the necessary. When connecting through my brother's phone using WiFi, this app logs me into his account instead of my SIM!!! I cannot even login into my SIM at all. After logout and login again, I am straight into his SIM account. | It's such a good application, to be honest until now all the functions and services are great. | Good application. | Nice app but there still place to improve interface | Good network for foreigners.. English speaking customer service available | It's very nice and practice application 😊 | Nice | Ok | I have never seen anything worst than o2 service, I don't recommend it | App has problems with ID scanning, paid SIM service didn't work when I payed for it, and all because of their technical problems. | Im sutisfied but sometimes the signal is weak.. | 10/2022. Nová verze a je to tu zase :-(. Nechápu, proč téměř po každé aktualizaci žádá aplikace o opětovné přihlášení. Nastaveno mám přihlašování přes otisk prstu a heslo si neznam z paměti. Proto, když jsem na místě, kde nemám možnost vytáhnout heslo z keepassu, nemohu se do aplikace přihlásit. Jinak s aplikací nemám problém, ale popsaná ""vlastnost"" ji znehodnocuje. U jiných aplikací podobného druhu jsem to nezaznamenal. Nedovedu si představit takto nefunkční app třeba u smartbankingu. | Good | One of the most expensive mobile operators in EU, probably around the world. At the same time the quality and network coverage is poor. You will lost the network even in the urban areas. If you have prepaid card they will steal amount of the unused mobile data in one month. This is a kind of robbery, in case you paid for it. It is the same if you buy a bottle of water, but the shop would take it from you, if you not drinking.. Avoid. Scam | Mohlo by být více muziky | Když aplikaci nejvíc potřebuju, tak to napíše "" máme pro vás nové funkce"" a nepustí mě to do ní bez toho, aniž bych ji updatoval. Po updatu se musím znovu přihlásit, protože mně to opět odhlásilo. Tyhle vynucené updaty aplikaci znehodnocují. Kromě toho aplikaci musím mít naklonovanou, takže ji mám v telefonu dvakrát, protože stále neumí víc, jak jeden účet. Kromě toho mě aplikace po nějaké době sama odhlásí a musím se znovu přihlašovat. V tomhle stavu je to pro mě už prostě bohužel nepoužitelné. | To use this app, need to scan id. Which is annoying. But still tried, and it cant scan my id!! Tried a lot of time, but its not working. Only, because the app is bad, I had to change operator. Idk, should I call it the worst service? I ever faced? Actually, I didn’t received any service at all. Maybe O2 is the worst sim company on the planet earth. Who knows, if the aliens have worse service then maybe 02 will get some competition on being the top garbage.

I'm try deactive this function, bu only what im see it's ""Your reqest has been send to the process"". And nothing change. I waited half an hour and tried many times already.

It just stops, won't let me do anything else | Extremna zla aplikace. Ve vyhodach se vubec neda hledat, to uz je prosim rovnou muzete zrusit, kdyz je delate takhle neprehledne. To, ze se pod stejnym emailem nemuzu prihlasit z PC (pry ""neexistuje"") i kdyz jsem naprosto v poradku prihlasen pres mobil je jen prijemny bonus navic. | Practical and well executed without unnecessary distractions. | Good app, but I'd suggest to remove it's availability only for Czech Republic. It would be easier for refugees to use the app. | tragic, registration proces not completed | Bothering application | přehledná | Nastavení jsou většinou jen odkazy na web Moje O2.

Z jiného důvodu lidi tuto aplikaci nechtějí. | Terrible, terrible app. Always rejects my login, email, phone number, everything. | Awesome | Simply amazing ☺️ | OK | Super | Easy to use | Excellent | Konečně to funguje | Good but sluggish | Good | Works very well never had any issues | Přestal fungovat přístup přes ověření otisků palců (teď se musím prohlašovat s mailem a heslem) + nefungují odkazy z notifikací (různé promo akce, nabídky a soutěže). Po kliknutí na notifikaci se v aplikaci nic neotevře. Mám pocit, že s každou aktualizací této aplikace se její úroveň jen snižuje.

Sice vidim, jestli mam zaplaceno, ale jinak: posila reklamy Neobsahuje volbu jak reklamy odhlasit Pokud v chatu chci odhlasit reklamy, rekne at napisu jindy Nemuzu pridat predplacenou SIM kartu Neustale se pta jestli se mi libi, ano prejde na hvezdicky, pokud ne, zazene me do formularu a vyplnovani emailu. Pokud chcete dalsi reklamy, krome tech po sms, tohle musite nainstalovat. | Nepouzitelna aplikace. Proc se jmenuje Moje O2 a ne Moje O2 SIM? Nenasel jsem zpusob jak pridat dalsi dve karty, ktere mam. | Pretty, fast and clean UI, all the necessary info is visible right on the home screen. -1 star because I haven't been able to pay via card online multiple times. GooglePay worked though. (Pixel 4a 5g) | Moje O2. Ahoj | I am confused. Are we paying you money to provide mobile service or for your ads? You have ads in the app you are sending ads via sms. You force to update app more than a bank app and on my second home i am often loosing signal. How many stars you would give yourself? | Works well, intuitive, no issues. | All is good!!! | Nice | Přehledná aplikace, jednoduchý a čistý design :) | Useless | Neustale ukazuje, že se některé informace nepodařilo načíst. Tím se stává aplikace zcela zbytečnou | Tato aplikace je fakt super | Useful application :) | Missing one star because some setting can only be done at web | V pohodě funguje | Nejhorsi aplikace z trojky operatoru u nas. Neumi automaticky zalogovat v pripade, ze je uzivatel na siti O2. Mezi aktualizacemi se smazou ulozene prihlasovaci udaje. A uplne nejvic me stve, ze na firemnim cisle neni mozne videt spotrebovana data v danem mesici, pokud uzivatel neni zaroven spravce. Secto a podtrzeno, adept na nejneuzitecnejsi aplikaci roku. | Dobri | Docela v pohodě | Whats use of app when you cant even sign in to the account, reset account pwd, activate packages and tariffs for weeks already. | Excellent | Proč po mně aplikace neustále ohlašuje a vyžaduje stále dokola přihlášení mailem a heslem, když jsem zadala, že se chci prihlasovat otiskem prstu? Prosím o opravu. | I can't use the app at all. The login fails for an error in the system | An excellent app. | Very bad experience ever with a mobile network, I paid the money I owe to a o2 shop but they later told me by text message that the payment is not reflecting in the office computer, so now it's my fault that you don't have competent o2 shop assistants?They blocked my Internet, bared my calls,.. bad experience ever. | Už funguje i pro firmy. Hezký design. | Docela fajn. Jde ručně přepnout jazyk appky do češtiny když ji mám v angličtině? | The download speed of the application is not the same on WiFi as on Data. The SMS code as a confirmation when logging in is unnecessarily complicated. Not all phones can automatically retrieve the code from the SMS. It's outdated technology btw. If you were to follow (for example) the online banking apps of banks that you already have in the Czech Republic, I think you could save the product. | What's happening with app? I can't use it during two weeks((( | Funguje skvěle. Jednoduchý a přehledný. Palec nahoru za tmavý režim :) | Finally, it is lightning fast. I also like fresh graphic design. App is well structured, billing especially :-). | Super good. Working just fine. Thanks for the update. | Unable to sign in using email. Get answer ""unexpected reply"". | Oproti T-Mobile je celé uživatelské rozhraní O2 pohroma. | Jakmile to zapnu, tak to vždy po 5 vteřinách spadne, takže prosím o aktualizaci Odinstaloval jsem to několikrát a pořád nic, furt mi to padá a žádnou chybu to nepíše. | Nejde zapnout ctecka otisku prstu.. vzdy se sama vypne? .. Diky za odpoved .. uz jsem to zprovoznil .. musi se zapnout trvale prihlaseni a pak uz to jde pres otisk pokazde. Vse OK. Diky | v 90 % se nenačtou informace a když ano, tak to strašně trvá | Hard to figure out how to fill in the 30cm platform 20cm patent leather size 37 allowed platform pleaser allowed blue and and always will be very hot wow wow wow wow wow really wow beautiful lady in heels very hot wow wow wow wow wow. | Aplikace tvrdí že je vše zaplaceno, ale po rozkliknuti se ukáže faktura k zaplacení. Naprosto strašný design. | That worked just to sk and im in de so i cant top up my card | Úplně k ničemu, proti Můj Vodafone nezobrazí vůbec nic. Naprosto zbytečná aplikace, jen odkáže do samoobsluhy v prohlížeči. Odinstalováno | Not in english | Usually can't log in with prepaid card. Sometimes it works via SMS code, but usually it crashes. Useless app. | Aplikace neakceptuje přihlašovací jméno (email) obsahující znak plus (+). GMail znak plus v emailu podporuje a webový login do moje.o2family.cz také. Zapnutí přihlašování pomocí otisku prstu nefunguje. EDIT: Pokud nezapnu trvalé přihlášení, zapnutí přihlašování pomocí otisku se samo vypne (zapnu, odejdu z nastavení, kouknu zase do nastavení – vidím vypnuto). Změním‑li si na webu přihlašovací email na variantu s plus, do aplikace se NEpřihlásím; nastavení téže adresy bez plus funguje. | Přišla neočekávaná odpověď ze serveru .... | Nefunguje přihlášení. | No popravde je to celkom tragédia, akákoľvek požiadavka v app (zistenie zostavajuceho množstva dát, prehľad faktúr atp) trvá neakceptovateľne dlho a z 90% dostanem hlášku, že došlo k neočakávanej odpovedi zo serveru a celé to spadne... Za mňa to patrí medzi najhoršie appky od operátora za celý čas... Prosím ak na to chcete reagovať z O2 tak žiadny ďalší email Vám k tomu písať nebudem... Nemám k tomu co viac dodať... | Stupid app | Příšerný, už nějak po 3. tenhle týden tato aplikace nefunguje, protože jí údajně ""vylepšujou"", což určitě ani ve finále nepůjde poznat. Navíc pokud má někdo rodinný tarif, tak je tato aplikace k ničemu a píše to, že nemáte oprávnění k používání aplikace a musíte použít prohlížeč. Na rok 2020 jsou služby této aplikace silně nedostatečné a podobají se spíše aplikacím z roku 2012. | Bad service, sometimes it doesn't work | Not easy to use in English | Aplikace zcela nefunkční pro firemní zákazníky ... | No English version! | Warum gibt es keine deutsche oder englische Version? Erster Anspruch: 2016!!! Will move to different mobile operator as it's a sign of deeper problems. | Nefunguje zmenit datovy balicek z vyssieho na nizsi. proste peklo. | I paid for 5GB and after few hours, the data vanished from the app. The money was taken from I account but no data and no information. I tried to find a solution with the Customer service but they said it is too complicated to fix it and recommend us to to pay for another phone number !? The worst is that one month ago I paid for 5GB again and they only added 500mb. When I asked for help they say I will have to wait 30days to give it to me back and I was not allowed to get a refund or anything. | Where is the English version please? | Nelze používat pro firemní účet. | Doesn't have English language, useless. I will desinstall it. | Bylo by pekne, aby se dala faktura zaplatit z aplikace. Faktura by mela na sobe mit QR kod s platebnimi udaji. | Proste nefunguje. Nendriv nezobrazovalo stav dat. Den nato zacalo po prihlaseni padat. A dnes se neda uz vubec prihlasit (neocekavana odpoved ze serveru). Je to tak tezky udelat funkcni app? Asi hrozne, hlavne ze jste ""1"", ze. Aplikace akorak k nas*ani, nic vic. Ty 3* mate jen diky historii: fake recenzim a lidem co uz tu app nemaj ale jsou lini reinstalovat a zmenit hodnoceni. P.S. Taky byste mohli konecne udelat ENG preklad, je to otazka par hodin a trva Vam to pres rok. | Příliš pomalá aplikace. Na Samsung J7 dost často trvá samotné přihlášení více než 1 minuta. Přes 3G ve většině případů dojde k timeout. Přes wifi obvykle se dá přihlásit. | gilich | why can't I make an account??? | K nicemu u firemních uctu. Prenesena data nenajdu ani v samoobsluze ani v appce. | I like it | cant log in | If I could update the rating to minus, I would! Still no English option on the app. T-Mobile is my main SIM now. O2 keeps steeling my credit after just a few months of topping up, the app doesn't explain why as it does not show any call history. Purely theft by O2! Does not display in English either, T-Mobile's app is much better with a 12 month rollover credit, I'm switching and never moving back to O2! | please have language options such as English or Tagalog. i know its for local convenience, but please try to understand Czech Republic have a lot of foreign worker. thanks. | Doesn't have English language option, it seems | Pres aplikaci se nelze prihlasit. Odkaz na Chat with O2 guru se na internetu neotevre a nefunguje. Rovnez nefunguje prihlasit se pres telefonni cislo nebo prostrednictvim sms. Applikace odpovida, ""Nelze vam rici co je spatne"". Skutecne ubohe a nejrychlejsi cesta kterou se zbavit zakaznika. | Fungovala dobře. Teď po přihlášení padá. | One point for lack of English support. | internet je uplne na hovno. | Only these incompetent guys can completely break whats is already somehow working.

Bez něj nelze provést registraci. Pro vývojáře: V každém mobilu existuje pro tyto účely WebView, neměli byste volat přímo Chrome. | Patrně to dopadlo nejhůře jak mohlo. Potíže bych chápal, ale již tři dny nejsou dostupné prakticky žádné systémy. Těžko tedy institucím věřit, že jsou schopné data spravovat. Prý mám zaregistrované 2 doklady na jiném zařízení a měl bych je odstranit z portálu občana. Tam však nic není (pokud se to vůbec dostanu). Pouze zbytečná zpráva o nové éře prokazování (trefné). | Aplikace je dobře navržená z hlediska UI a poměrně srozumitelná na použití, ale jelikož už autentizaci přes Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu mám nastavenou už z dob covidu, tak jsem byl přihlášený prakticky okamžitě. Problémy se servery už naštěstí opadly. | Top. Konečně super nápad♥️👌 Staženo ještě den předem takže jsem se vyhl problémům s registrací.

Registrace již v pátek 19.01. večer, v pondělí 22.01. jsou pak údaje stále bez problému přístupné. | Že aplikace ma offline režim, a ten jen funguje, kdyz si vypnu mobilni data je absolutně stupidní. | Funguje spolehlivě, alespoň bude tlačit zbytek egov kupředu. Vlastně mě jen rozčiluje pomalé načítání a poskakující úvodní logo (mění pozici i velikost než dojde k zobrazení dialogu na otisk) | Nefunkční | Díky za snahu o zlepšení digitalizace v ČR! Těším se, až přibudou i další doklady, možná nejen ty vydávané státními institucemi? 🤩 Aplikace ale má ještě mouchy. Zdaleka největší je ukrutná pomalost, i v offline módu trvá i přes deset vteřin, než se uživatel vůbec dostane k přihlášení – nechápu důvod, určitě by šlo zlepšit. Z okna ""Prokázat se"" nefunguje tlačítko ""Zpět"" (intuitivní ovládání v Android); stisknutí křížku ""×"" funguje, ale je také nepochopitelně pomalé, několik vteřin se nic neděje. | 👌 10/10, snadné, rychlé, nepadá | Funguje. | Po přihlášení přes AirBank app, černá obrazovka. | Jednoduché rozhraní a funguje 👍 | 21 století je tu! :) Jen škoda, že se stát standardně nepoučil, co se týče spuštění, mohli jste si ušetřit špatné PR. | ""Nejsme schopni dokončit Váš požadavek."" Jak jinak. Registrace nefunguje ani přes bankovní identitu, ani přes Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu. Jak jsem mohl čekat něco jiného. Kántry fór da fjúčr. | Nefunguje už třetí den po sobě | Neskutečné chyby v aplikaci při registraci občanky, dodnes nevyřešeno. Ve web portále vidím dva! eDoklady, jeden nejde odstranit, proto asi nejde registrace. Tu apku NIKDO netestoval! | Nefunkční. Různé chyby, různé kroky, ale registrace nefunkční. | Aplikace k nám přijela z roku 2013. Dostali jsme krásnou react native aplikaci, která možná funguje, možná ne. Všude máme černé pruhy abychom byli v bezpečí a nevěděli kolik máme notifikací nebo kolik je hodin. Aplikace taky nevypadá stejně jako na screenshotech, což je vždycky dobrá známka. | Katastrofa. Nelze se registrovat. Nefunkční. | Nefunguje registrace dokladů | Tlačítko registrace vůbec nereaguje. Takže aplikace nejde použít. | Příjemně mě překvapilo, třeba o možnosti ověřit cizí doklad jsem se dozvěděl až po stažení. UI nevypadá až tak zle (viz web ministerstva vnitra). Na druhou stranu bych měl i několik důvodů proč strhnout dvě hvězdičky. Prvně vůbec nechápu loading time, je záhadně dlouhý (optimalizace). Za druhé mi trochu vadí, že to není open-source. A poslední třetí poznámka se vztahuje k dnešnímu výpadku, ten mi ani tak nevadí, pokud se nebude opakovat, ale chybělo mi tu tlačítko na offline mode. Bez dat to šlo | Nainstalovano, sparovano, duvody na pozadavek udeleni opravneni vysvetleny, navigace jednoducha - za me dobra prace a posun statu spravnhm smerem. Diky! | Registrace přes bankovní identitu. Během minuty hotovo. | Jediné plus asi, že to jde spustit a nevypne se přitom telefon. Nic jinýho ta aplikace neumí. | Je vidět, že České úřady jsou jako vždy připraveny na to, že se někdo rozhodne využívat jejich elektronických služeb. | Za me dobry az na par detailu. Problemy s prihlasenim se vyresi az nebude takovy napor novych uzivatelu. Ale proc ten QR kod na prokazovani se nacita 2 vteriny, ackoliv jde nacist i offline, takze to neni kvuli odezve backendu. Kdyz chci jit z prokazovani zpet, tak nefunguje back button a musim hledat krizek po obrazovce jak na iphonu. To same kdyz chci odejit z aplikace. Back button nic nedela. Tmavy mod by taky byl super. | Up to now, not working. | V aplikaci zatím vidím víc chybových hlášek, než dokladů. Přihlášení se nedařilo (15000) Nápad dobrý, provedení bohužel drahé a mizerné. | Stale nefunguje registrace pomoci identity obcana. Proc publikujete neotestovanou aplikaci? Je stejne neotestovane i jeji zabezpeceni? Vsak jde jen o hlavni doklad k identifikaci, statni sprava, no stress :-( | Nefunguje přihlášení | ""Registrace pomocí Identity občana se nezdařila 10000"" Tak po dni, kdy se registrovat nedalo vůbec, kvůli přetížení serverů mi vyjela tahle nic neříkající chyba. | Ještě přidat dark mode a bude to supr😊 | Na toto jsme roky čekali. Obcanka se sparovala bez velkeho usili jen přihlášením do banky, to jsem ani necekal ze bude tak snadne. | Digitální občanka... Co víc si přát. | Podařilo se mi zaregistrovat bez problémů a funguje dobře, hned dnes vyzkouším co mi na to v baru řeknou | Doklad se nepodarilo nahrat, zkusit znovu nepomaha. | Doklady se nepodařilo aktualizovat. | Great initiative but unintuitive onboarding process. Once it's done, good. | Funguje na první dobrou, nainstalováno a aktivováno během dvou minut. | Aplikace nefunguje, při přihlášení přes MojeID ukáže chyba 10000. | S aplikací jsem spokojen, funguje bezproblémově na Rootnutých zařízení / Zařízení s vlastním OS což je dle mého názoru velké plus, že se nemusí nic obcházet. Jen ty problémy s registrací no, příště by to chtělo zvednout kapacitu serverů | Nefunkcni, nelze se prihlasit bankovni identitou. Zkusil jsem nekolikrat, vzdy ""nejsme schopni dokoncit pozadavek"" | Funguje to tak jak má. Prostě elektronická občanka. | Zatím se nenaskytla možnost využití v praxi, nicméně prvotní přihlášení a zobrazení identifikačních údajů zatím bez problému. :)) Přijde mi trošku zvláštní, že jsem se přes nastavení mohl na jedno kliknutí zapsat do registru ověřovatelů a nyní tedy asi můžu začít kontrolovat doklady, i když k tomu nemám vlastně žádný zákonný důvod. Ale když nad tím tak přemýšlím, tak je to asi takto lepší, než kdybych musel posílat papírovou úředně ověřenou žádost kamsi na Vnitro... | Čekal jsem, že když dám Registrovat pomocí bankovní identity, tak se mi otevře bankovní aplikace, kde se otiskem prstu přihlásím a bude hotovo. Místo toho vidím embedded prohlížeč, kam mám vyplňovat jméno a heslo do banky - krásná příležitost pro phishing. Jsem trochu zklamán. | Vypada použitelně. Na žádný z obrazovek nefunguje systémové tlačítko zpět. UI by chtělo trochu vizuálně doladit pozadí agresivně přetéká do lišty zatím co nad ""Doklady"" je zbytečná mezera - jako by tam něco chybělo). A chybí nějaké tlačítko možnosti zpětné vazby přímo v aplikaci aby ty drobnosti člověk nemusel psat sem. | Funguje | Funkční, pěkné a především jednoduché a intuitivní! Teď ještě vyřešit zmatení mezi eObčankou a eDoklady (kde mám občanku) a bude to top :) | Vše funguje jak má | Registrace se nezdařila | jednoduchá a moderní aplikace | Intuitivní, přehledné. | Chyba 10000 při registraci, nefunkční aplikace, doporučuji prozatím nestahovat a ušetřit si nervy s nefunkčním přihlášováním | Excellent application. The first impression is very good. | Bohužel, nefunguje. Nedaří se Registrace ani přes Bank.identitu ani Mobilní klíč - žádná chyba, jen černá stránka. | Nelze se ověřit přes Datovou schránku. Nepoužitelnost v zahraničí, nutnost tedy neustále nosit plastovou. | Spustili aplikaci, ale chodili jim tam lidi... | ověření a první párování bankovní identitou je peklo. 2023-01-20 přihlášení se nepovedlo chyba 15000 (Fio banka) | Aby bylo mozne pouzit je treba mit nastavene zamykani telefonu. Telefon potrebuji k praci. Takze 2 moznosti - muzu mit pouzitelny telefon, ale ne s obcankou a nebo muzu mit digitalni obcanku, ale bez telefonu. Jak to resi jine aplikace? | Prihlaseni pomoci bankovni identity funguje bez problemu, tak jen pockat az to pujde vsude pouzivat :) | Funguje jak má. | Super aplikace | Na první dobrou mám občanku v mobilu, teď ještě počkat než mě zkontroluje nějaký strážník 😅 | Paráda lidi, funguje. Propojit fakt snadný a už můžu vyběhnout ven jen s telefonem. Díky moc, tohle je fakt posun dopředu. PS: Extra body designérům. Barvy občanky a pixel art lev na QRku. Skvělý! První dojmy nad očekávání. | Jednoduché přihlášení přes portál občana s mobilním klíčem; vše přehledné a srozumitelné; luxusní ikona u UI. Nemůžu se dočkat, až se služba zítra spustí a budu moci někde vyzkoušet. | funguje | Neintuitivní, bez instrukcí... | Nemám vesměs co vytknout, možná jediný co, tak údaje které chci sdílet by bylo snazší si vybrat předtím, než se spojím s ověřovatelem a ne až potom, co to spojení navážu. Jinak super, ani bych neřekl, že to je státní aplikace. :-)) | Ach jo. Kluci verim ze mate na vic. Spousta blikajicich webview? Banery prekryvajici texty v aplikaci? Nedynamicka ikona? O DM si take muzeme nechat zdat? Vzdyt to je zadarmo kdyz to pisete nove a nativne. Proc je hlavni stranka defakto prazdna a jen dole maly obrazek zadni stranky obcanky? K cemu je kopirovani kazde polozky na me obcance? To nevim jak se jmenuji a tak abych si to mohl zkopirovat do schranky? Aplikace se neda ukoncit back buttonem? Proc je vyhozeny status bar?

The balance is then negative and it's so annoying! Of course I can disable recurring but it's also annoying to do it each time. | Nothing you cannot do on the web other than rare special offers. The company is not nice and the prices are through the roof. | After reinstalling I don't see any crashes. However, this app does not accept standard payment methods such as VISA cards or Google pay to top up credit. | Widget funguje jen chvíli | Velmi nepřehledná a vizuálně ošklivá aplikace. Zmatky vytvořené aplikací mi způsobily nezaplacené účty za které jsem pak museli připlácet 500 za ""vymáhání"", i přestože mi jen přišla SMS. Docela drahý SMSky tím pádem.

V tomto vaše služby a atato aplikace katastrofálně selhává. | V aplikaci mi chybí nastavení ""Nepřeji si být obtěžován tou blbou krávou z T-Mobilu co mi 2x měsíčně volá s nějakou debilní nabídkou!"" | Poor app, I can't pay my billing in this app. | Nova uprava nicmoc, neprehledne, male | Nice | One of the last updates broke navigation within the app that leads to freezing the phone screen. | Loading is pretty slow! (Already 3 years of struggle with this problem, good job!) Now they added notifications about ""nothing"". You can turn them off via phone settings, but this kind of thing should be off by default. Why? Because the notifications are about ""please open your app, you can check this and that there!"" Of course I can check it there, that's why I have it.. give me some special offer or stop spamming idiotic messages about what your app can do.. | Updated on 24 Sept and the new versions is enormously bloated. The app looks more like carnival than a comfortable tool. | Když už aplikace vyžaduje při každé aktualizací znovu přihlášení, tak by mohla aspon spolupracovat s password managerem (když už teda nenabízí dnes běžně možnosti odemčení biometrikou a zapamatování účtu). | Very slow unreliable, I cannot open it even when I have unlimited data.

Velice dobrá práce. Díky vám za to a hodně úspěchů do budoucna. | It's a ""happy app"", the dialogue is friendly and fun to use. | Apka je přehledná a nabízí spoustu možností, jediný co bylo zvláštní, že při volbě nového tarifu se mi zobrazovala nabídka 3 tarifů, ale v prohlížeči na webu bylo na výběr z daleko více možností.... To by chtělo upravit, aby i v apce byl stejný výběr.. | I use it sparsely.

Perfect! | Vrátila jsem se k vám na konci loňského roku a jsem překvapená, jak velmi se T-Mobile změnil k lepšimu. Ve všech směrech: technologicky - vaše apka je skvělá, ve službách - jednání se zakazníky, poradenství, jednání se zákazníky ... naprosto bezkonkurenční! Gratuluji a přeji celému týmu T-Mobile další zákazníky, stejně spokojené jako jsem já. Uspokojení z práce, to je dobrý tým, spokojení klienti a skvělé výsledky. A to všechno vy máte. Díky! Marie Hofmannová | 😊 | Nejlepší aplikace na spravování svého tarifu či kreditu | Great | Kratom | Aplikace otravuje obchodními sděleními a nenašel jsem možnost jak to vypnout. Jedině je vypnout na úrovni os, čímž přijdu i o těch několik užitečných. Nezobrazuje ani zbývající rychlá data u neomezeného balíčku. | 👍❤️❤️❤️ | 👍 good | app logged me out automatically and after next login app shows different tarif than before, no one from support is able to solve or at least explain this | Dobrý ale, dodatečné datové balíčky je možné platit pouze kartou a jednodušší způsob aby se odečetli na faktuře není možný. Nepochopitelné.... | I can't even log in after they logged me out of this app, seriously so bad apk | It has only one widget. This widget is even not possible to adjust, for example it doesnt show remaining minutes and sms. Every time I look at the widget I have to refresh it to see any information at all. It is impossible to find a way how to remove mobile number ""connected service"". Required updates suck.... | Za dlouhodobě téměř nenastavitelný widget hvězdička dolů(možná dám časem i druhou dolů, protože je to hlavní funkce, kterou od apky požaduji). Aplikace je jinak fajn a jednoduchá. Prosím o vylepšení widgetu (zmenšení rozměrů, průhlednost a hlavně zobr. více služeb najednou na jednom widgetu), pak dám rád 5 hvězdiček. 05/23: Tak widget se sice o malinko zmenšil, zato k horšímu, protože na něm vůbec nelze zobrazit jiné služby, než jediná náhodně zvolená služba. Proč? | 06/23: Update nic nezměnil. | Super | Je tam jen jeden obrovský widget (4x2), který nejde zmenšit. Čekal bych jich více a i menších (1x1) -například pouze s info o zbývajícím objemu dat. | Fix your stupid app, I'm tired of having to pre-install it every time it says "" Something went wrong, try again later"". | App is super buggy, when trying to pay I rather use the web app (although that is not better) | I cannot access my account in tmobile, i already go to different tmobile shops they dont know how to fix | Forced update way too often. Refuses to be used to pay the bill even if the update log just says some minor bug fixes. *The point is not that the pay woumd not work, the point it says an update is necessary and refuses to work without.* Even when the log just says minor bug fixes. Obviously reinstall does fix that but suggesting it as a fix is nonsensical. | Something good | Horrible, I cancelled the subscription because EU is not single tel zone anymore, but still getting charged for non using telephone | AGBAPPCZ | Aplikace je super. Ale otravuje mě ""odhlášení z bezpečnostních důvodů"". Nevidím k tomu důvod, žádný bezpečnostní problém jsem neměl. Zbytečně to komplikuje používání aplikace. | fakt spatnyyy | Buggy and not localized. Most of the pages are in Czech even though my language preference is set to English. It's slow and most of the things throw errors. In spite of that, it's the best way to check remaining data and to make payments (whenever they work). | Good and cinvinient App | omg so much like avlada | Its a good app but I hate the low quality of the app's logo | I love this application. It's easy to use, it is full of easter eggs and so on. Its customers in this app are able to activate a lot of benefits, as summer break mobile data etc. You can participate in contests with electronic prizes in general, however I've never won before, but it's fun to participate. It's only pitty that the support bot isn't such excellent and doesn't support custom replies. After all for me it's the best application of the best cellular telecom in Czechia. I recommend it! | Po dnešním updatu přestali fungovat srdcovky. Zobrazuje to stejnou chybu: err unknown url scheme. Stejný výsledek i na druhým telefonu s androidem. | Should have better English options | Im a foreigner in Czech, using Tmobile and its practically nightmare to get more internet on it. | No úplně na picu. | Nepouzitelny kus hna. Zakoupim simku instaluji aplikace a po 2 hodinach nemám nic. Cislo se nedá přidat. Takže do popelnice simkartu a zpet do O2 | Okay ish Dejte si facku za to, že když Vám dojde internet přes SIM, tak Vas to nepustí na internet přes aplikaci a nenechá Vás to koupit víc internetu nebo dobít kredit. Aplikace má mít přístup k internetu i když Vam zaplacený došel.... | Nabídky v apce vůbec neodpovídají mému tarifu. Žádnou nemůžu využít, ale přesto jich tam vidím spousty. | I OWN THE RIGHT | Goof | Nice | Not able to refill card with non czech credit card. Have to buy a new sim card and switch phone numbers every time.. | good | Unfortunately T-mobile isn't a good company anymore, they change their plans and ask you to pay more without your permission here is their message: Dear customer, as part of the improved tariff offer we have prepared new tariffs with new prices for you. We will move you to one of these tariffs on 20.11.2022. These tariffs of the new generation are full of further benefits. Are you interested in what benefits you get and what will be the price of your tariff? And they are higher tariffs, Shame | Xobre | It works. However, it is incredibly slow and consumes a lot of data to open it. | Apart from occasional loading issues, requiring clearing cache, the app has seen an improvement in both content and features. | Neuvěřitelně pomalé a obtížná orientace v aplikaci. Aplikace startuje 5-10 vteřin (pomalejc než třeba youtube), widget se vždy dlouho načítá. Sice člověk po otevření aplikace vidí kolik má využitých dat, ale zobrazení počtu zbývajících minut či sms se musí složitě proklikat. Widget taky zobrazuje pouze data (když zrovna funguje). | The app is not working from 23:00 to 3:00 with explanation: ""servers need to rest too"" which is complete nonsense because of this I have to rate it one star until this issue is resolved. | Unable to use foreign card for top up? Never seen that before .. quite disappointed | Při vyzvednutí odměny za dobití dojde k pádu aplikace. Při vymazání Cache a uživatelských dat, dojde také k pádu aplikace po přihlášení a pokusu o vyzvednutí odměny. | This is good app | Když aplikace funguje tak funguje dobře, bohužel mi už několik měsíců padá hned při startu :/ | Impossible to login | Aplikace si vynucuje ukladani platebne karty, pritom to vypada ze neni zabezpecena ani proti vytvoreni screenshotu citlivych udaju. Na 4 krat jsem kartu zadaval (30 min) ... Dale popis balicku ""jednorazov"" a ""opakovane"" dobiti kreditu je v aplikaci stejny !!! To mam hledat na internete abych se dozvedel v cem je rozdil? ----- 2Veronika: Dakujem za informaciu, podstatne vsak je aby sa to objavilo v aplikacii ... davam 2. hviezdicku aspon za rychlu odpoved. | Great | Appka funguje ok, ale poměrně časté odstávky jsou dost otravné. | ok | Love T-Mobile | Už nedávají neomezené data na léto. | Rubish app | Nefunguje nenačítá se i když mám wi-fi | Awful, cannot login using mobile phone number. Requires valid ServiceID in mobile phone field, what this should mean for me? Absolutely unintuitive Finally logged in, but still very useless error information. Guess this goes more to company itself, not to application. To developers: consents activity layout is terrible, buttons to approve with consents is mostly out of the screen, text cannot be seen at all, it was kinda a puzzle to press the button and go forward. | It keeps stopping....I need to pay the bill!!!! | I find it unbelievable that I am not able to install this app outside Czech republic. What's up with that? I am a long time Tmobile customer who lives overseas and regularly visits my family in Czech. Yet I can't excess my account. Please explain me the reasons and please remove the pointless restrictions. Thank you | Usually have problems with convection. My request can not be processed. It happens so often that I need to get extra megabytes but application is not able to get the data and let me purchase bundle | no more free stuff 1/5, constant updates for no obvious reason, app? more like crapp | Vnucená aktualizace přinášející nové zbytné funkce a pouze ""drobné opravy"" | Hard to use for foreigners, English version isn't working, half time it's still Czech. Not intuitive, I struggle everytime to find what I need. | Aplikace doteď super, ale po koupi nového telefonu Samsung S20 FE, nelze aplikaci po instalaci otevřít Edit: Po updatu vše v pořádku | Je to dobrá apka a mají dobré dárky | Nelíbí se mi design souhlasu s marketingovými službami, je příliš jednoduché omylem přijmout vše a pak je složité najít, kde se souhlasy upravují, a tak většina se s tím nebude trápit. Připadá mi, jako kdyby to udělali schválně. | V aplikaci se mi nezobrazuje služba internetu, pouze telefonní číslo, takže nelze zaplatit všechny služby najednou. Přestože mám všechny smlouvy spojené s tímto telefonním číslem. | Zas vic jak mesic nefunguje 3D secure brana na dobijeni kreditu. Nebudu se vic vyjadrovat, ocividne tmobile nema zajem o poskytovani cisel a telefonich sluzeb, priste staci zrusit firmu a prestat blokovat lidem cisla misto toho aby jste se rozkladali v primem prenosu. | Tahle aplikace to je katastrofa. Asi nejhorsi co jsem videl, nacitani zabere tunu casu, furt jen cekam nez se neco nacte. Ale dle recenzi je tohle normalni. Co rict nemam vice slov... Zlaty vodafone! | dogshit app dogshit company | I paid late fees on 3 occasions because app was not displaying my bills properly and it occasionaly gets frozen or crushes | Bekkeje | Application is for Huawei p40 pro+ owners useless. This is for an IT company like T Mobile a bad reputation. | App is 50% translated and makes problem to understand it properly. If they make it fully translated it fould be 5/5 stars. | Being forced to update the app every time I try to use it, kinda sucks. Especially when its not on Wifi, trying to check the remaining data... | Superb | Great | Edit: Aplikace nyní funkční i na novém androidu (v.12). Aplikace funguje, ale nenabízí přehled služeb a placených cen což je škoda a konkurence nabízí - aplikace tak kromně placení ztrácí význam. Škoda nevyužitého potenciálu. | Apka se ani neotevře na top Android 12 chytrém mobilu. Přeinstalované 4 krát a nic. Vidím, že nejsem jediná s touto recenzí a poslední update byl v říjnu 2021...to snad ani není možné s tím nic nedělat pro takovou organizaci jako je T-Mobile. 👎👎👎 | Nejde spustit. | It crashes on Android 12 :( | Otravná aplikace, co posílá reklamní notifikace, o které se nikdo neprpsil, a pokud se zkusím přihlásit otravuje vzzdy se zadáním telefonního čísla, jako kdybych ho snad každých pár dní měnil. Děkuji předem za reakci ve smyslu ""my o problémů víme, my se jim zabýváme, my ho řešíme"" - n@sr@t | App is ok but need to option for English also | Na mém telefonu nefunguje - Nokia x20, Android 12. OS mi píše jen: 'The app keeps stopping.' | Bohuzial po nejakych updatoch sa mi uplne zrusili naviazane sluzby a opticky internet mi nejde uz ani pridat (uzivatelske meno neexistuje aj ked sa nim v pohode prihlasim na webe). Skusenost tristna a navrat par rokov spat ked neplatim vyuctovania v appke, ale rucne... velke sklamanie | The most horrible app experience. Laggy, full network , full wifi signal and it lags constantly. Constantly not working , completely or just parts of it. You wanted to make a payment , well to bad the payment component is momentarily out of order. Really horrible experience, also why T- mobile did you take out pay with Google pay? Either way if you need to use this app like me, good luck and my condolences. | Like | Celkem jednoduchá a přehledná aplikace, takové mám rád. | Jsem spokojen. . | It's really good | Good working | Everything is good but i wish people like me that ,not knowing czech, the advertises and offers also come in english. | Nejhorší aplikace kterou jsem používal za posledních několik let. Kazda banalita se musí řešit na pobočce protože v aplikaci na to uživatel nemá práva... Nikomu nedoporučuji. | Ok | I can't put my number in. I enter my phone number in and I get no message code, can you please help? | Huawei SDK included (HMS Analytics), checks for China ROM | Naprosto zoufalá aplikace, kterou je za trest používat. V pravidelných intervalech, poté, kdy zřejmě na straně TMobile dochází k nějaké aktualizaci systému, neumí načíst data o přidaném telefonním čísle a tím pádem ovládat služby s ním spojeném. Reinstalace nepomáhá, prostě po nějaké době to zase začne fungovat. Na zákaznické lince je mantra ""zkuste reinstalovat."" | It badly even let's me on the app because it says that I'm not connected to the internet even though I am | I trying to used my sim as paying deposit or top up | Good | funguje jak ma 🙃👍 | Příjemné prostředí, snaha zlepšovat. | Priselna zaostala aplikace, slozite ovladani, spatne zobrazeni na ruznych zarizenich. Vnucuji reklamy, dobit kredit trva nejmene pul hodiny, prvni platba je vzdy zamitnuta, musi se to delat dvakrat, hruza, strata casu, koukam po jinem operatorovi, ktery je schopny dodat sluzby z tohoto stoleti | Nejlepší operátor mám od nich neomezený data , ale i tarif z neomezenými daty SD normálně ❤👍 | Po poslední aktualizaci po zapnutí aplikace vyskočí okno : Je požadovaná aktualizace aplikace. | Pog | Quite useless, mainly advertising nonsense offers instead of announcing payments or other important events on account. | Na úvodní obrazovce nejsou má registrovaná čísla pro samou reklamu téměř vubec vidět. Co je horší, po aktualizaci aplikace tyto údaje zmizely. Byla prostě odstranena tato všechna telefonní čísla. Musel jsem znovu ze všech zařízení vyjmout SIM (kvůli přijmutí bezp. kódu) a znovu registrovat :( | Super network | Good | Super aplikace, ale někdy hází jen tak chyby. | Gud | I am quite unhappy with the app it is very unstable and cannot complete most requests with it, not even changing the language. I always get ""Neco se pokazilo"" message. I already deleted all cached data and reinstalled the app entirely, but there is still no way for me to activate the free summer data as the request always fails. I have A11 One+ 8t, already tried 4603 support where I was told it is likely because of the phone, which is laughable as 8t is very modern good quality device... EDIT-Reply: Yes, I was eligible. I was able to set it eventually on the 10th try or so. The app did not give me any confirmation or showed the unlimited data. I had to verify it through the call center. The data status changed in the app only after a couple of days. If the app was not the only means to apply for this or pick up my free monthly data I would have uninstalled it already. | Nelze mi skrze aplikaci aktivovat extra data nastálo. Zkoušel jsem přeinstalovat aplikaci a několikrát jsem prošel přes různé platební brány. Vždy po návratu do aplikace jsem byl vrácen k obrazovce s zadáváním karty a nic se nezměnilo. Mám firemní tarif, ale to aplikace ví. V webové aplikaci se mi podařilo aktivovat jednorázová extra data která jsem si spletl s daty nastálo. Ty tam ale nejsou. | Why this app needs permission to read my contacts?!? Edit: Děkuji za odpověď. Aplikaci jsem nainstaloval, toto oprávnění v rámci možností telefonu zakázal. Zatím vše funguje a appku začnu používat + změna na 3 hvězdičky. | Funguje dobře ve češtině, ale v angličtině myslím že nikdo netestoval to. Když vyměním jazyk, ta aplikace neukaza můj účet, je trochu jako nemam sim kartu od Vas. | ""Vsechno od T-mobile v jednej appke"" plati asi iba pre telefony. Rad by som si tam pridal aj internet ktory mam od T-mobile ale pridat mozem iba tel.cislo. Mozno je to navrh na zlepsenie do buducna. Pri plateni faktury by som uvital aby som si pri moznosti platby vedel napr. zvolit ze chcem zaplatit aplikaciou mojej banky, aby som nemusel kopirovat plat.udaje z aplikacie do aplikacie ale slo to automaticky (mozno to uz existuje ale o tom neviem, nemyslim QR). Inac vsetko v poriadku. | Nice of skroz | Ok | User friendly app | Aplikace mi při instalaci nastavila domácí stránku v chromu na tmobile.cz, bez zeptání! | Top | Aplikace spamuje nevyžádané notifikace | 1) Don't understand why if I chose ""English"" as the app language, WHY OH WHY, am I receiving messages/ notifications FROM THE APP in Czech? Ex: Co máme v apce nového? Koukněte na nové funkce, výhody i vychytávky naší apky - Vše najdete přehledně zde v sekci Novinky. 2) app takes too long to load 3) Also, within the app itself, not everything is in English such as info about rewards... which I also don't understand 🤔😳 | Pokazde, kdyz mi prijde upozorneni na neco v aplikaci, tak to konci chybou nebo oznamenim, ze nic nelze nalezt. | good | not work / just freez on start😕 | Great ,easy to use | Aplikace by byla užitečná, ALE informace mají problém se načíst napoprvé, Widget neukazuje stav volných minut a SMS a služby jdou přes aplikaci nastavit jen hodně omezeně. Problémy nemizí ani po přeinstalaci aplikace a vyskytují se na více zařízeních.

Great job TMobile! | Fakt mi musí chodit 2sms a 2 notifikace v den zaplaceni ? Widget věčně nefunguje | Skvělá organizace 👍 | Super přehledná Aplikace, někdy občas blbne ale to jen málo, a super výhody pokud máte T-Mobile Operátora | Completely useless utility, full of buttons but non of them do anything. Also a loading simulator. | Pokaždé, co ji otevřu, chce to nainstalovat novou appku, protože je prý zastaralá. Jaký to má smysl? Proč ty aplikace pořád rušíte??

The card won't connect properly. It's never been a problem before until recently. It says the card is already added, but doesn't show where the card should be. I've contacted my bank, they've issued a new card but this hasn't changed or fixed the problem. Uninstalled/reinstalled many times, cleared cache etc+others ideas nothing helped. Now use physical card for contactless buys. G support have been helpful to an extent but even they don't know what's gone wrong! | I try Google wallet first time in walgreen didn't work I don't why it need better a update and more accurate and secure and rewarding for using it | All in all, simply brilliant & fabulous | All the loyalty cards just stopped working for no reason and tips in the developers' reply gave no clue | Just think enough. | New update has stopped all my card from working via Google pay. Will be uninstalling. | Add lock feature like Google pay has so if your phone is taken or someone knows your password they can't just get in your wallet. That's what I love about Google Pay | Won't work anymore and no idea why | Love my Google Wallet. | Why did you just took 5,99 euros out of my bank account? I didn't pay anything myself | Crashes on card open | Ím new tó | I got a model_10 | Don't work on my tablet or android phones | Twice now all my cards have disappeared Had to reinstall all of them again Once more and I will be deleting app | Very good | Love it | They change that ever payment even small need unlocking the phone, I'm going back to my debit card so I can pay easily for small amounts without pin or unlocking. Useless app now. | scammers trapped me I'm lose money throght google payments. Google blame me. Thank you scammers | Now started asking verification for every small payment, this should be an option the user can change. Verifying and trying again sometimes causes the cashier to have to restart the payment, causing annoyances and delay. My debit card works contactless without verification for small payments, so you have made the app much worse to use than the card itself. It worked well before why did you ruin it? | Cool | This app takes money frymy account if I'm next to a card machine please improve | I like this app very much and I recommend it but for some reason I am having trouble with the last update, it's not installing.... | Someone hacked playstore | Google pay was so reliable! What happened with the latest update? Since.changing the 'no need to unlock' it's been awful. Unable to tap on/off opal card readers in Sydney. Error: need to verify.with fingerprint. error, please try again can't read cars. 3rd time lucky. By this point the bus driver has attempted to close the doors thinking you don't want to get off. And a queue of people waiting behind trying to tap on/off. Please fix it! | Why doesn't it say on the app that it only works with specific phones?? I almost got the biggest disgrace of my life the other day | We use tap and go here in Australia. Can you make it so don't need to unlock phone if under $100 | Very good app | Chris Bartow is a hacker and Tommy even is a hacker | All is well here | excellent | No option for fingerprint confirmation before payment | Requires to unlock phone every time I wanna pay. My credit card still doesn't. | App seems to be very secure, but it doesn't give very many options to ID verify, I've been trying to do that for several weeks now. Please give me some insight on how to get it done, Las Vegas NV resident | Still no fix for an issue I have had for months. When I try to pay after unlocking my phone and tapping to pay, the NFC reader asks me to check my phone because for whatever reason Google Wallet asks me to verify my fingerprint and unlock my screen AGAIN even though I already unlocked my phone to pay. This requires to get an error the first tap to then pay on the second tap. Very dumb design | It let charges go through without asking first. But things I try and actually purchase it doesn't go through. | Recent changes require pin entry for every transaction... so you present your phone, it doesn't go through, so you take your phone back and enter your pin (now a 2 hand op) then present your phone again. In many cases the vendor has to reset their terminal. It's easier just to tap my credit card. I was low on storage anyway so deleting google wallet was an easy choice. Used to be good. Not worth having now. | Good app | Yes please | It won't load the tickets I bought. | Upgraded my Samsung a12 to Samsung s3 now it doesn't work I have tried everything nothing works | Easy. Super easy. Convenient. | Why are there only 4 different state options? | Need to be updated so it works with all phones. | It's been trying to force me to install this to use Google pay and through my account for in ap purchases which I do not care for. Also heard its not very secure and my bank would not ok the set up through them which tells me is very insecure. Do not use. | You must be kidding?! Fingerprinting every single tap to pay payment, even for couple of cents?! Have it in US if you are required but why bothering EU users? | Im very pleased | worked once and isn't working anymore. | I get an error message that says there's a problem setting the active account? Would you like to try again. 10 to 15 attempts and I still can't get into the wallet. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. They're way y'all can help me right here. It doesn't have anything to do with Enterprise software. I don't believe? I hope not! This is getting expensive | Hello Team! I had an issue and reported I was told it will be resolve very quickly but now it's more than 2 months and I am not getting the response from your side, several times I approach but nothing. Hope to hear from you back via this review. | For some reason it says that my device is not enabled for Google pay. It was working until a week ago | 😍 | I want fingerprint verification to open this app, but I can't add my fingerprint | One of cards is stuck on the account. I've taken all other cards off app then deleted app. Then removed all cards from account then reinstalled app. The stuck card was on the app when reinstalled. If I tap card to try to remove app goes into permanent loop. Now not much use as setting default card doesn't work correctly. Broken. | Used to be great but after the lastest update it suddenly requires fingerprint unlock right before every payment, even though my phone was already unlocked and the app was opened and ready. It's really annoying and defeats the purpose of sparing time if I have to go through this every time- putting the phone to the pos terminal, only to have it deny the transaction and lock itself, requiring me to unlock it again, sometimes my fingerprint not matching the first time...so frustrating!! | ok | am with S24ultra. It been stopped working for 2 weeks now. firstly can shop in store but not TFL London transport. but this week totally dead not working at all. have to use physical card again. contacted bank and TFL but found no issue or blocked webs from them. Is Google wallet problem. so inconvenience. fix it please. | Finding very hard to open | Hot | Needemails | 100 parsant okay | Just stopped working, my card won't open, it just spins for eternity, it was ok , tried everything, cleared cache reinstalled app and cards I'm using pixel 8, it was the same on my old 7 pro, very frustrating, thinking about switching to another app ? | Was working ok. Now it is saying it won't because my phone is not certified / recognised... It should be as it is a bonafide android 13 phone and everything is up to date.. and this Play store says it is certified!! | Looks nice and everything, too bad it doesn't work. | It has stopped working... uninstall/reinstall didn't work. Removing and re adding cards doesnt work. Edit in response: anytime I open the app and go to use a card from the wallet vis contactless payment, nothing happens | How do you stop this app from scanning without security first. It will scan without bringing the app up? Need better security | Awesome | Security is terrible. If someone were to steal my phone from my hand while I was using it, they could go on a spending spree. Put a seperate lock on the app! | Took £1 off me for paying my energy bill what has me paying a bill got to do with you? Refund it now, bill isnt pending so why have you taken my money? | Without me updating my phone or the app, this app no longer automatically works. It prompts for PIN or fingerprint for every single purchase, no matter how small. I tested it just now by paying for my items across 2 purchases, less than 60 seconds after I verified it asks me to be verified again. Usually this leads to errors as the second time fails often, and this is also extremely infuriating. This makes an app I've used for all payments for the last 2 years totally useless. | Cannot add my card with nothing after change my phone. It is fixed so 4 stars until next update | Hi ser god morning | once updated to latest version , all existing credit card data disappeared and need to be reenter | Nice I like it all | When Xiaomi released the new software update suddenly Google pay stopped working and it doesn't allow me to add my cards. Everything works properly except the GPay | There is a problem with setting up my active account. Wallet was working well only days ago. No I cannot access it! | I am blocked to pay with my phone. It randomly works. I have no clue why that happens. In some shops I have no problems and it works fine, in some others I get warning... | so ez cuhhhh | Excellentayyyyy | This app make my phone lack until I play games also can't smooth | Does this mean my funs over. As much as I hate to admit it I do need more socal interaction for immediate issues. So what's this mean. Thank you I'm not even sure If I get it yet. | Tap. Sometimes need to unlock phone. Done. Feature request: I wish there was a way to require unlock for all purchases. Great app regardless. | I have to unlock the app AFTER I have tapped the reader. This is very inconvenient when the reader is positioned low. I don't mind unlocking every time I use the app, it's just difficult to unlock it IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSACTION. | As long as international bill payment is not supported from Ethiopia, I couldn't afford to purchase any product of my need online shopping. That's why I'm going to rate 3 for Google wallet, since I'm not satisfied with. | Password every time I use it, | Fire | Was working great, but now keeps asking for my passwords and pin numbers when I am trying to pay, even when I have unlocked my phone saying it needs to verify my Id? Has become very inconvenient to use. | I enjoy using this application so much that I even downloaded it on my son's phone to add his money card. I want him to be able to purchase things on his own when he goes on trips without me. However, Google Wallet is saying he's too young, despite me giving full permission. Can you please help change this? | Lovely | good | $safe | Scary how well it works. | Phone forces this app on my phone. Never wanted but forced to waste data to download | Stopped working 3 days in | Good | Stopped working. Was working fine up until 3 days ago. Now it wants my finger print. So I do that and it won't work at all. Close app and reopen, I hold it to the reader and it shows the check mark but the machine declines it. My bank card still works fine. App doesn't. Annoying. Ininstalling. | All good | I'm honestly getting really tired of the constant swapping between wallet, pay, pay send, etc., but especially when they discontinue one app while leaving a half baked option as your only choice. I cannot manage my cards because it asks to verify the phone I am using as a passkey, can't verify it, ask for my password which I enter correctly and it accepts it, but it still then wants my phone as a passkey. Awful. | GREAT | I have to get this right! | Bigo | Constantly having to clear data then reinstall as it tells me my software isn't up to date (though it is). It then works for half a dozen transactions before the same message pops up. Have learnt not to leave my actual wallet at home after a couple of extremely annoying supermarket trips! | it's solid | b Dr gu imi ca, | This app is spot on and works absolutely flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy SM- A528B and never failed since I installed it. The negative star reviews on here I can't understand it's probably down to your phone set up or you simply don't know what you're doing setting Google wallet up in the first place. Keep up the good work Google. | Didn't do what I need | Every time i try to open this app it dont open n crash. So uninstalled it n using other app now. | Great for standard cards, hopefully more support for custom merchant cards and memberships, for both wireless and non-wireless purposes. | It requires pin code for every purchase even the phone is unlocked already. | Today on each purchase wallet asking for pin code, its annoying! I tried to remove Bankf Of Georgia master card from wallet it says ""mastercard *** successfully removed"" But card is still in wallet, i tried to clear cash also remove all data but card still exists in app. What the heck? | Like cash app | Absolute garbage recently. I have to restart my phone when I'm trying to pay for travel in the underground, Tesco... It really is annoying standing like sausage at the station gates What the hell happened??! | I was confused, didn't know what press. Please make it easy for me. | It's showing payment suspended after I enter my card details. | good | Something happened with the lock functionality. Now, when it attempts the user to unlock for a payment, it keeps asking for unlock and when you unlock it, it doesn't make the payment. This scenario stays in a loop when unlocking is necessary. (Seems that it's not for every payment machine. Just happened in a PagBank machine, for example) | Luv it it made my life easy as it should be thanks | Very informing!!!. | It's a awsome app to use and it really helps keep my account organized love it | Love it | It's so easy to use | Absolutely useless | UPDATE: ISSUE STILL NOT FIXED!!! DON'T ""FIX"" SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT BROKEN!!!! New update has a fancier animation to switch cards BUT CARDS DON'T LOAD WHEN YOU LAUNCH APP SO YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN GOOGLE ACCOUNTS THEN THEY SHOW UP WITH MUCH LAG! What a waste of time! | you ve avoided my question, why after 9/10 days it literally keeps asking for me to verify , the app pointless waste of space | Google pay work. This app not secure.It let's anyone that can get in phone access. Doesn't show transactions when purchases are made. | Make phone number | I got scammed | Can't be locked or secured separately from phone lock | I've been using it for a very long time and I am satisfied with the people who are able to work with you and your very good friends and I am interested in the same way I have received it for a few years I haven't been or really had any problems with it or anything else and thank you all once again. | Really convenient app for event/entertainment tickets and also payment methods. The only issue I've found is that some event tickets are not archived after the event has happened, and there's no option to archive them. | Great app | Great service | All my cards have suddenly disappeared without any notification/information. And no, I haven't changed any security settings or done any actions explaining that. This is very annoying as the app is useless without cards and I now leave my physical cards home.... | Now Wallet can handle pkpass files. This is what makes Google cool. As much as Apple hype Integration I believe the Google ecosystem is much better. This is why this app gets 5 stars. | Love this app thanks Google for making it sexy give me a lady with a wallet. | Are you Google weather for all of my credit card and gift cards add event my cash app cards Google wallet is used all around the world Google wallet is so convenient to have do you have with you you can buy everything with your Google wallet Eden shop at Google Play store so if you don't have Google wallet all right Google Pay download it right now both and by the way on 20-year-old Google Gmail account member in my name is Producer Terry Lawrence Johnson 🏧💲🪪🖋️💳💵✍️ download Google Pay 💳 | I love 💘😘 | Need to be easier to get your own personal card number and design From what r your interest (General) | It's good | Been fun but next time I want Earplug,Blinders, and Lips so dont slip 😂. | What a rollercoaster! After working perfectly for years, it stopped. I'm now presuming it was due to an old phone at end of software support. Last week I upgraded to Pixel 8 Pro, and it's magically back to normal again - as it should be. All bank and loyalty cards are present and working. This is an app that you never really think about until it's not working as intended. Apparently I've now got 7 years up my sleeve before I have to work about it again! 😅 | ""Verify it's you"", even though the device was already unlocked with my fingerprint. That's what we get from lazy and incompetent postmodern codemonkeys. | 21.03.24 this app is still not working. Fix it! I've done as you said. It's not working since the upgrade in Feb 2024. I have to carry my cards with me at all times, not happy! Fix it ASAP!!! I'm not sure how to reply. It is the Google Wallet when trying to pay for a purchase using an EFT machine. It just doesn't work since update. My rewards cards work though. Location is Australia Replying again.. I will try as per your suggestion via email..I'll be in contact again if it fails. | Not compatible | Fantastic | You can turn NFC on in the wallet but can't turn it off? | My Huawei cellphone updated to Harmoney OS4 and you say my phone doesnt meet the security standard. What is the logic in this? Sooner or later I will ditch this whole Gx garbage.","{""1"":369337,""2"":51600,""3"":85621,""4"":143536,""5"":908892}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Google LLC","5700313618786177705","google-payments@google.com","https://pay.google.com/about","1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043","https://policies.google.com/privacy","5700313618786177705","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DHBlQKvUNbopIS-VjQb3fUKQ_QH0Em-Q66AwG6LwD1Sach3lUvEWDb6hh8xNvKGmctU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wHPP4mjBRywNkDOJ-6IpdI2H39buQ8OhfScYc7oNMLyedctH-U8m5Rjk2YDMRytb6ZI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xWmsRbqQJUPLkVzjQSKtMHs_OO3uzaucj-nofyu6z3wH5Yk8qkOPvWngpfRQUaE2WiQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-7MXU92VBf_SRiD7xG9XI7JoZzpv8-0OCN2xNLMT4SHx7f7hVwCKnA1louSmEvB6zQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bAjZhhMvAikTsRxlrBQ53zlAEHy60zaFINewyd21CFR2wbLCMUIMdNvrtCMIAtJYpQo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oEBcFE3vI_lWARhA9i-kYhAbpm90VbqXN8JB4IutM3jWXxV5F1kKhKyhy3hnCcCDTg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UfFCFUmQA7F7-Ecl6WQ3ypik83LpsDspGvmIQNtgQl9M-k4IOimqTLIuel5PwkMfL_Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/i2e1t1Z1_ltBixQ_898iGEUdpQK2IBxnHtGd7Bci_pz8KfY2TPabhyEYaDfOMDT1NFc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W8LfDF-728ZlihFjv9ZWPV8yYeaZxFPDZam58H-_6pVVi2Bg6iRWcS0k9gWelvpWpu-d"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8vKc5TccVqIgyWhEpTFUYhTkY-5d9XpFzi1ZLKkxy5zSlBe8dKzuH3aJnG7NH8DFug"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0MemXwmFGX553raLXC9frvHmPBiIPtjdFjYdae6vl87_2zkyfIsYvImvYiidPjxDYycL"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WcVw0lpI3QvA0uWw4toAGRJ6MO3IubdyD0CffjYr1LDw7NbVwShKbst7YiaNA6k6iAFo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7BfsnKcWqrM-Snl8uYEYZEPNUeDkRr7aOm1D4XMWMoNxKTrKNWgVmtzxnunqGjeNXmI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J3QNC_EFBi_qgxddGvkz5RpgIXgwg6cizM9y6wbHB3q0xINxqNHuYPHjb-6lQGFvoL3A""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Nov 13, 2017",1710984658000,"VARY","• Keep everything protected in one place, no matter where you go with the new Google Wallet.<br>• Enjoy faster, safer, easier access to essentials like your payment cards, loyalty cards, concert tickets and more – all from your Android phone.","[""Very glitchy and stops working for no reason very often so I need to restart my phone.

"Moje VZP","My VZP is a mobile app that allows you to check your insurance payments, payer history, or a summary of the reported treatment conveniently from one place. It is intended for all VZP insured persons who want to communicate with us electronically and do not like to go to a branch office. You can easily register your entire family and check the data of all its members from one account.

To use My VZP services, you can:

For yourself.
For your children.
As a guardian.

As an agent, for example, your spouse, grandparents, parents or anyone else who can give you an officially authenticated power of attorney.

What do you find in your app?

Overview of health insurance payers. Check who is paying for your health insurance premium. And who paid you for the last 5 years.

State of health insurance payments

If you are paying for yourself or have ever paid health insurance premiums (such as self-employed or self-employed), make sure you do not have any arrears or discrepancies in your payments.

Survey of Income and Expenses

We enable self-employed individuals to provide a VZP Point bonus application with an overview of the income and expenses of the self-employed without having to visit our branch or send it by post.

Overview of Health Care Payments

Find out what health care you received from healthcare facility reports, and how much that care was. You may also notice any discrepancies.

Charges and supplements

Check the amount of your deductible supplements for medicines and food for special medical purposes, taking into account the statutory limit of protection, after which additional payments will be refunded within the statutory period.

Access to the data of our insured persons can only be made on the assumption that we have active insurance (not completed under EU or long-term insurance). You do not have to be our insurer to set up a crowd, but we will be glad to do so.","My VZP is a mobile app that allows you to check your insurance payments, payer history, or a summary of the reported treatment conveniently from one place.

Pandora let's you watch an ad and then listen to the music you select. The fact Spotify wants me to watch ads and STILL not get to actually listen to anything I want... like, why would anybody use your service?? | ഊമ്പി | Too much adds...I really don't like it🤨 | Paise mang rahe ho 🥲 | i been using spotify for 5 months now and there seen to have no issues but after this update i can't listen to every songs i want that is unfair and i have to pay 10 dollars a month to listen to whatever songs i want when i was broke | This app doesn't play the song I want to listen and always says to buy premium. | Good but could be better | Literally this app is useless, don't use it. After skiping 7-9 songs you unable to play your favourite song. | writing a review just to say using mobile as a payment method doesn't work or it's just me, well it used to but it really doesn't anymore | too good | Really good if you are douing a warm up ffor hockey | Not able to login with my mobile no. Error shows check your mobile number | It's a good app. Don't get me wrong but you only get six skips before your not allowed anymore. | Very nice | I just love the music. | Worst app | Great | I've been paying 6 months the premium version, but in this last month the app doesn't allow me to play my downloaded albums when I'm in offline mode, it does always say ""something went wrong"" | my lyrics layout when shared looks so bad..it isn't like everyone's layout. I hate it | Eles vão me dar dinheiro | Just got a new S23 FE and when connected to Android Auto (via Bluetooth & wired connection), the Spotify signal intermittently breaks up and sounds like 'Norman Collier' before working again and then back to Norman, it does this irrespective of where the car is, build up areas and countryside. Waze & WhatsApp working fine on AA, so the issue is Spotify, any ideas? Ta | It's getting worst day by day.. now I can't even listen what I want.. so many annoying ads and recommendations.. it used be my favourite app.. I don't know why you are so desperate to make people subscribe.. I can't listen my choice of song.. for that I have to wait another 24hrs.. seriously😂😂.. now you'll decide what should I listen.. congratulations Spotify you lost one more user.. due to limited words I must say 500 words are too short to describe your chutiyapa.. goodbye Spotify.. | Excellent app, my only issue is the load time when I am set to offline and trying to listen to music I have downloaded for offline use. | Good good good good good good good good good | Good | Crashing updates, was the best app ever. Now all trash with these silly updates. I can't even play any song or any random song (Android) | Damn, 😩 | I don't know why this app doesn't take my email and phone no... I don't like this app | Using Spotify connect, phone cannot change volume. Sick to death of troubleshooting in my free time. Spotify is quite expensive and I expect it to work. | Awful. Songs no longer play normally. If I have a playlist open, once a song ends, nothing plays. I have to be monitoring my playlists, which totally defeats the point. I have uninstalled the app multiple times, but the issue persists. | Ilove it. | Liked it but now it's just waste nd useless.. would give it 0/5 | Fix your app. No good list of songs, ads every 2 songs, i cant click a song plus I have to skip to it on my playlist and I can't even do that because I can only SKIP 6 SONGS PER HOUR. Yall falling off the music playing industry fast | Love it | I have the best experience with spotify ,I recommended you to use it for good music | This app is solo much good for me because l'm music lover | premium is too expensive, and it won't let me get student premium even though i'm eligible. Made by scumbags | One star is very high 4 this dirty app | Recently, I've noticed that the Daily Mixs and Radios I listen to don't ever mix in songs I haven't heard. It's just the same songs mixed around every time I open a new mix or radio station. Sometimes, a new song will sneak in, but no more than once or twice per mix. At this point, I've subbed to YouTube Muisc, and I'm already having a better experience and will most likely cancel my Spotify subscription before the next payment cycle. | Amazing AAP | New version is slow. When I click a song it takes 10 seconds to change. | Worst app ever ...It was very good before the new update,now it has become desperate to make us buy the premium membership . We can't even replay a song ,skip songs,select a particular song etc . .worst decision by Spotify ever ... | Easy to pick the music I like | Ok I love the music that I listen to but I live in the country and I don't want to pay for the primuin just to download my songs I would like it if you can just make us download are music for free so that we don't have to have the internet to listen thank you | Any update it keeps on saying there is no song here go home so you can find a song just for you and I don't know what that means but it a good app tho🤙 | Amazing app!! | Dilnawaz | Sometimes the songs stop and then I get very angry when things like this happen. | This app has been ruined... Earlier could nicely play a particular Playlist, but now spotify plays songs which aren't even in the list. Why would you ruin it for us | would be nice to have some of the PC features (ability to sort playlists for example), and doubt I'll ever buy premium despite the ads for the simple fact being able to choose what song you want to play is free on PC but paywalled on mobile | Average | This is utter waste a ton of advertisements and we can't even press the buttons without premiums | Love using Spotify. | I was liked Spotify app, But Spotify make us so disappointed & you shouldn't do. they want that everyone will take there Spotify premium but everyone can't afford or everyone don't want to try your every plan so you must have to understand each & every user's needs & situations, so please stop putting limits on everything like, ""if we want to play another song more twice in a single day, so we have to get Spotify premium"" please stop doing these & atleast don't loss your non-premium users. | Mark my words this app will bankrupt(sink) soon due to recents update | Best music app | BYE BYE 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️ | App has gone to the trash. You'll get the ""30 minute ad free music"" ad and then get ads 2 songs later. Ad breaks are now 4-5 ads long. There's far better apps out there now. Save your time and skip this one | Don't install the apk is VEST 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫NOT WORKING | Wow they brought it back! Thanks spotify. The old free features are back! | It is damn ridiculous how bad this app has gotten. It is very annoying, not just because of the constant interrupting ads but also how stupidly slow and incorporative the app is. | This app is such amezing | Switching between video and audio makes the song start from the beginning | I love this app 💕💕💕 | I already downloaded the entire Playlist, then why do some of the songs not play when I'm offline | Good app and experience I literally LOVE it. | Worst experience | Very nice 👍 | Can you please add the feature to rearrange the order of songs on a playlist? | The music 🎶 is very interesting | Totally ruins the mood when a song interrupts the ads. | Great | Good but not excellent | new updates are so irritating.. | Excellent app!!! Never disapoints me | Great job | Love this app. One thing I've found that I would like to see changed is after adding songs to queue, they stay in play history so I can just go back after a song or two if I wanted, and they're still there. | Using this app seems like you are living in a dictatorship. No rights ,no freedom to choose. | There is a lot of ads if you don't have Spotify premium but a good app to use to listen to music | I don't know how it changed into a complete trash. It's just a useless application now. | I think it was India's best music player I am so interested to download this app | Ok | Pls try this atlist one time | I mean man why they didn't remove search bar form Spotify free⏭️⏸️⏮️⏯️ | Better than Amazon and cheaper | Has turned into a useless app. Not showing any episodes of podcasts anymore! Nor is it allowing me to play music. | This app has gone from best to worst. Now I cant select songs that I want to play, I cant play songs on repeat mode, cant see playlist. I select a particular song and app will start playing some other song by same artist, I mean why?? It is only good for podcasts now, But not for songs. | I had bought a single premium and then upgraded to Duo, then went back to single, and now im going back to duo, but when it transfers me to google Play to purchase it, it says switch to your other google account even though its on the right one. Last time i fixed it by deleting the app and re-downloading it but now it wont even let me access the option to change my plan. | Bring back the heart! If I click a + button its to ""ADD TO A PLAYLIST"" when we clicked a heart it was ""ADD TO MY LIKED TRACKS"" you broke sht up! | Worst experience in the new update | Despite having many exclusive podcasts, the podcast userface is unusable. It does not work well, it's clear there has been no effort to improve the user experience for podcast users | Its fine, but I hate that only premium have good stuff | i cant use the app if im using cellular data. just wifi | 03.2024, still the same review... The app is amazing, but a publicity after every two songs is simply forcing you to go premium which unfortunately is way too expensive in Switzerland, it's coubter intuitive and makes YouTube almost a more enjoyable experience | Best music app | Cheap Business trick | Righteous! | Don't support free music 🤬🤬🤬 worst app ever | Good application | worst without premium. I'd rather go for youtube premium that way I can get YT videos and music too. Never going to install this stupid money minded app ever again🤬🤬🤬 | worst | Because of the ad I am giving 1 Every single song ad is there improve it spotify thank you | Indescribably horrible app.... I just can't imagine how any app can be this bad ... Even after so much backlash , the founders/creator of this app don't give a heck | Worst music player | Getting too expensive to subscribe | Out standing | Ok👍🏻 | Really???? | Good | I loved it soo nice《~☆5☆~》 | Just love it..! | Should be nominated for worst app of 2023 Year! 🤬 | Wrost features 😡🤬 | Shocking UI. Awful user experience. Cancelled a subscription.. | I loved Spotify but now I hate.. Ut music and wynk r wayyyy better now tleast they allow us to rewind the songs n choose the songs we want. | Sometimes it works reliably! But usually not. | Awesome app for music lovers of akk kinds. Dump Pandora. | I am so sick of this app just shutting off I am looking for a better app. I loved your app until it would get a one song played then 1/4 into next and shut off. I have no permissions so why pay for what won't work. 😡 | Great stufff | Stop bombarding me with Ads | The Shuffle mode is always similar | Premium is so expensive like I even have to pay if I want to turn of shuffle. | Dear Spotify stop ur ads...it's enough...u r not YouTube...u didn't have the fame like YouTube...Many ac are uninstalled for those frequently ads | Very worst app.. Before there was a option to play songs in shuffle and to play previous songs after some days thy made it for premium. Now to play any song by taping it, for that also it is asking premium what nonsense it is.. Even though the song is not nice we have to listen aaah?? Very worst experience😡😡😡😡😡 and there are no Kannada songs more. | Enjoying your selections that fit my likings in aerobics | Absolute worst. I can't even select song I want to listen bcz of the daily limit and ads | It's so good, I love listening to music, so 5 STARZZZZZ | Best app out there, nothing else comes close. | Always telling to buy subscription 😞 | Meddy | It used to be free.... But now even to select a song we have to pay bruh.. I hate it | This application is good though but after making changes in song playing, because of premium plan, it's made me quit. If u can pay for listen music,you can download this .. But I don't recommend this it's now a useless app. | it's just trash just use YouTube music instead | Made a playlist, but can't get it to play, just keeps playing recommended songs instead. | Almost nothing works after the last update | Why name it a music app when you can't even listen repeatedly to the songs that you like? Wish I could give this sham of an app zero stars | Special music player | Cannot live without it. Lol | Impossible to use unless you pay for it Not only that, even if you listen to the ""ad break"" for 30 minutes of ad free listening, you still get ads nonstop. UNUSABLE | Worst | Spotify forces you to look at terrible podcasts and even play them in the ""queue"" even if you never followed or god forbid, listened to one for 3.5 seconds. Marking them all played doesn't make them go away and there is no ""not interested"" button no matter what Spotify has to say about it. This goes back years and it's not going away. I'm paying for this too commercials and all. Actually talking to a human gave zero answers as well. | Totally flawless services | 🤮 | Not good need premium for everything so very very bad ad are more than misic | Dawlod | Its amazing and coustomer care response is so fast and good | This Advertisement app occasionally plays annoying music. I just want to watch my ads in peace. Didn't drop to 1 star just because it plays plenty of ads. | Super apps | Faltu | Nice app","{""1"":1961067,""2"":689763,""3"":822525,""4"":2632726,""5"":24632927}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 89.00 - CZK 2,699.99 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Spotify AB","Spotify+AB","support@spotify.com","https://www.spotify.com","Spotify AB

But the app itself could use some work, certain glitches or errors in certain features effect the listeners experience in a negative way. For example, the jam feature, where 2 or more people can listen from different devices at the same time, it's a great feature. It's a great way to feel connected through music. But whenever you add a song, or the host adds a song, the song glitches"",""Great if you have premium, if you don't, well at least it's not buggy. The adds are are too frequent and repetitive, at least give as variety with our adds. You can't listen to music offline and when you do play music it's on shuffle (personally I'm ok with this, but it's still a terrible decision). However, the absolute worst is when they play songs you either don't know or dislike, and only give you six skips an hour. It'd be better if I could actually listen to the songs I like. Uninstalling."",""Way too many ads. There's almost always an ad after each song, its rare to have 2 songs in a row before an ad, it's gotten ridiculous. A year or so ago it wasn't like this and I could have a few songs play before an advertisement. It is much too saturated now. Literally YouTube music, the free version has 0 ads and unlimited skips. Only downside is it's harder to find new songs which are recommended to you on Spotify."",""Overall solid experience, the algorithm is so good that on long car rides I can just pick one song and never have to open the app. But I personally have 1 major issue with the app. There is no gesture to minimize the player, I don't want to have to tap the arrow in the top left to minimize. It's too far, just let me swipe down. It's so tragic that everything else is solid about the app, but the few minutes I spend in it is so annoying without the swipe down gesture."",""FREE PLAN REVIEW! This is the worst place to listen to music. Maybe right after normal radio stations. If you think that YT is bad when it comes to ads, don't even try Spotify Free. 2 songs 4 ads, no option to actually choose what you listen to, only more or less artist. Limited skipping, no option to go back or \""reset\"" the playlist that app prepared for you, so forget about listening to your fav song more than once and when you want. List goes on. Paid also starts to force ads in some podcasts.""]",false,false,false,"com.spotify.music","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Or even better: an overview of spendings on all accounts combined | Still operates in Russia | The app is cluttered, counter-intuitive, with lots of spam (so-called ""offers"" form the bank, which cannot be turned off), repaying credit card does not update the amount left to pay (so even if you repaid the whole amount - the app would still show that you owe the full amount to the bank), etc. And I am not even saying anything about the overall bank approach towards the clients... | Very good banking system and great experience with this bank | Horrible.

Thanks. | They didn't leave Russia and the app sucks, Equa Bank app was WAY BETTER. | too many maintenance days where the app is unusable. | Edit my review, as the initial inability to activate it via internet banking has now been worked around by RB by adding the ability to activate via RB klíč app (that has been forced upon everyone before). It's an okay banking app, but it has no useful features comparing to web banking (and thus superfluous): no push notifications on card transactions and account charges, for example (and e-mail ones are still range from barely useful to useless in the case of non-CZK currency charges). | I have good experience with this bank. I have had many banking experiences in DK/N/ČR and this bank is worth the fees.

To samé se děje u analýzy výdajů a zařazování do jednotlivých kategorií. Přidal bych také analýzu příjmů a možnost vyřadit převod peněz ze spořícího účtu na klasický z příjmů. Po vyřešení těchto problémů nemám problém dát 5* | I'm a client of RB for over 12 years and during the same time using at least 3 other other banks in CZ. RB annoyingly keeps updating their app every month or so but it keeps just getting worse and worse. Difficult, unintuitive, crowded simply put: a mess (The website is even worse) All other banks I use have simple straight forward interfaces. Equa's was excellent till RB swallowed them Unfortunately they learned nothing from it. What a shame.. | Nová funkce evidence digitálních peněženek a uložení karty na různých webech je skvělá. Tohle se vám vážně povedlo. The new feature of digital wallet overview and card records on various sites is great. You guys really did a great job with this. | Aktivně vás nutí do nevýhodných produktů + při splátce kreditky trvá i den, než se zas navýší limit (nepochopitelný) | Velmi nedbale napsaná aplikace. Značné datové nároky, zcela mimo rámec mobilní komunikace. Neošetřené vstupy, hrůza. Zvažuji uninstall a zrušení účtu, tohle ani jako hloupý vtip. V porovnání s předchozí svižnou aplikací nebe a dudy. | egua bank app was much better | Great, easy to navigate with some good features. | one of the best bank in Czech Republic, and the most stressfree in Europe | Edit: I set it to the smallest level ""No notifications"" and right in the next login another offer of some insurance. Always nags with unwanted offers. You cannot open the app without getting them. Loans, mortages, credit cards, unwanted app functions. Extremely annoying. | Jakákoliv bankovní aplikace, do které se přihlašuje pouze číselným pinem, je bezpečnostní odpad. Otisk prstu nic neznamená, když na pozadí je pouze číselný PIN. Jak je možné, že si tohle mohou banky dovolit (RB není bohužel jediná)? | This bank randomly closes bank accounts to it's clients without any explanation. | The app isn't only unintuitive to use, it's riddled with annoying ad widgets and popups that lead to another popups asking you why you don't like their popups. NO I DON'T WANT ANY LOAN REIFFEISEN. Makes you miss Equabank app and consider switching for good. | In general de app is good, however it keeps asking if I want to borrow money, putting a misleading button in the first screen. Another problem is the RB Club, why to ask for discount at the store? Few times happened that the store didn't know they have a program with RB club and did not provide the discount. Best is to return the money automatically when the purchase happens in the places that are part of the program. This os how it works in Moneta and Ceska Spořitelna, much better! | Indeed, best bank ever. I confirm | Koně nemám rád :* | Slozity a nefunkcni overovaci system. Netusil jsem ze kdyz aplikaci odinstaluju a nainstaluju protoze mi prestala fungovat, nelze se do ni jednodusse znovu prihlasit. Ani pres web se do internetoveho bankovnictvi nedostanu.

Takze jsem tedy ted vecer zustal bez pristupu na ucet... | My debit card's wireless usually stops working after 6-7 months, so I have replaced 2 cards already. In the Block Card reason there is only STOLEN or LOST. I would suggest to add NOT WORKING so that it's clear why the card was blocked and replaced. | ID scanning not functional | The application nor your website (rb.cz) are working properly. I am unable to login and as a result cannot send payments out that are necessary for me to do. | Mezi vsemi bankovnimi aplikacemi tahle vynika nejvetsi otravnosti. Jak aplikace, tak IB od Raifky je spis reklamni portal na vsechny jejich zbytecne produkty. Miziva optimalizace UX. Kdyz vypnete zobrazovani reklamnich nabidek, za cas se zase aktivuje zobrazovani = nejste panem vlastni aplikace na vlastnim telefonu. Horsi pristup tezko pohledat. A to si rikaji klientsky nejprivetivejsi banka. Cekam, kdy mi zacnou nabizet stiraci losy. | Aplikace přestala posílat notifikace z plateb. Ano, sama od sebe, vše mám povolené. | Proč je to tak nepříjemné? Aplikace otravuje pořád s něčím. Edit: děkuji, Kláro, to je přesně ten problém, že to jde skrýt jenom dočasně a že každé otevření aplikace s něčím prudí, I když mám všechno ""vypnuté"" :( | nice and fantastic bank | Spam v notifikacích na půjčky, v rámci pohybů, zaslané zprávy v rámci aplikace, SMS ... To opravdu ne. Banner nahoře s nabídkami mi nevadí, ale jiný invazivní reklamy jsou hrozné. Mám více bank a tam takhle agresivní vnucování v aplikaci nevidím ... S RB jsem od akvizice Citi a bohužel začínám uvažovat o změně mého hlavního bankovního účtu. Edit: ani po 3 letech žádná změna a nabídky opravdu nejdou vypnout (mluvím o těch při startu aplikace) | not working user id... | the best bank app out there | Since RB took over Equa, I've been disappointed. The app is not intuitive, there is no easy way to copy account number when you want to receive payment. Actually, receiving payment is hell. Where even is any option to copy your bank account number? You have to rewrite all the numbers manually as it was done 15 years ago. | easy and convenient | The app is just okay most of the time, but the UI is kind of cluttered and hard to navigate. They also show ads for their services and, if you hide those, they still pop up again after a while. The Equal Bank app was better when that still existed. | Absolutely sucks compared to Equa bank. They shouldn't have taken it over. It is always always down or inaccesible for maintenance | Originally this app was in both Czech and English. Several months ago it updated, now when I set the language to English, it's about 90% Ukrainian with some random English. Very difficult to do anything with my account. I have even had both Czech and Ukrainian friends they to help with no luck. | Banking trash that covers pedophiles and ruined the economy deliberately | ceska | Nefunkční QR Payment pro pdf | After yesterday's update the app keeps crashing. Reinstall didn't help either. | Horrible experience. If you get locked out of your account, you need to go to one of their branches for them to allow you to use the application again. It's funny how you might need to use a public computer or network to login to your account via browser. But you can't re activate your app for ""security"" reasons. Yeah it can happen during vacations. Great idea. This is crazy. | Obchodní nabídky jsou otravné, nespletli jste si účel aplikace? Mám nastaveno na minimum a stejně každý den vyskočí nerelevantní nabídka | I přes zrušení souhlasu s marketingovými nabídkami mi stále nabízení po zapnutí aplikace nějaké služby a nabídky, které mě nezajímají. Reiffeisen není banka, ale spam. Budu si hledat jinou banku | Zlodeji! Zrusil jsem cestivni pojištění pres app 2x a stale je mi uctovano. Přítelkyně to same. Jako puvodni klient Equa je mi z RB fakt zle, sama past, jak na minovem poli. | nice | Internetove bankovnictvi otravuje na prvnim miste s uctem ktery byl u banky pred prevodem sekundarni, a nijak nereaguje na hvezdicku ""nezobrazovat jako preferovany"", nelze ucet nijak schovat/odsunout. Ucet se vtira jako prvni volba do vsech plateb a jelikoz je eurovy, hrozi extra poplatky za prevody | You are very good showing me offers but not having a usable gui where you can delete the templates. You also cannot copy accounts details from transfers or copy in general. Prinscreens are not allowed. Why do you have 1 payment button under the account tab and one at the bottom but the back button doesn't take me to the main page? Hire a UI/UX expert please. | I'm fully satisfied with this application. | Good and functional app. I'm a client almost for 5 years. | Not responding, kindly share the email to send you the screenshot of the issue | very 👍good | Not very intuitive, the phone back button doesn't work in the app, when I changed description of a standing order, it duplicated the payment. It could and should be better, this is not some startup challenger bank. Lovely response in the spirit of ""the problem you are experiencing doesn't exist"". | Bank is useless, can't open account as EU citizen. I could do that with equa before. Trash being a EU citizen with legal residence in another country is legal residence permit in Czechia. Other banks let you open an account and it is EU regulations that you are infringing. | Děsná aplikace, člověk se musí proklikat hromadami reklam na jejich produkty nez se dostane na obrazovku, kde jsou kromě mnou hledanych informaci další várka reklam. Ty se dají zakázat ale jen na chvilku. V prvé řadě jde o reklamy. Škoda té EquaBank, kež by oni koupili Rajfku a zařízli jí, stejne jak to udelala Rajfka s EB. Produkty stojí za prd a ještě je musím 50x denně odkliknout že nemám záhem. Si myslíte, že si to jednoho dne rozmyslím nebo že mně reklamními bloky udoláte? | equabank byla mnohem lepší nevyžádaná změna | Top notch service and security | It is very unfriendly to hide the category of future payments under the History button, together with all regular payments. Instead of History, it should be called All Payments, because it is a mix of future and past and of one-times-only orders with recurring orders, too. | 🤗 | Ten blbec čo vám navrhuje procesy by mal byť prepustený a zadusený poučkou o základoch GUI. Absolútne neintuitivne ovládanie. Zlé cesty k službám. Posielať SMS s reklamami, blokujúce popupy, že ste zmenili farbu... musel vymyslieť niekto kto UX nikdy nenavrhoval. NEBLOKUJÚCE OZNÁMENIE O ÚDRŽBE JE NEPRÍPUSTNÉ!!!!!!! | Excellent | aplikace je hrozně pomalá | I don't have the account anymore. I deinstslled it but still it proposes to update. What the hell | There are a lot of features to navigate. But it does everything you want it to, smoothly and without hassle. | Nice app, works fine | This app is useless. Constant crashes and infinite loading. When you need to use app urgently it fails to work. I have tried all possible solutions from my end, none have worked. Absolute utter rubbish. Wouldn't recommend. | it cannot increase font size | QR payments don't work. Says the qr code is invalid but it works in other apps. | I am very unhappy with the app. Whenever I want to make a new payment, it just switches itself off. | BE CAREFFUL WITH SAVING ACCOUNT OF RAIFFEISEN BANK, IT IS A SCAM. STEALING MONEY OF KLIENT BY A LOT OF REASONS... BIG BRAND BUT CHEAP SERVIS! | Snažil jsem se znovu aktivovat svůj účet, neúspěšně. Napíše mi to, že musím použít RB klíč aplikaci kde když všechno provedu, tak se nic nestane a v internetovém bankovnictví mi to napíše že RB klíč již nelze používat. Když to zkusím přes internetové bankovnictví, tak mi to napíše že přes internetové bankovnictví už to taky nejde aktivovat. Tudíž tuto aplikaci vlastně nejde aktivovat/používat. | good | vše ok. Dobře udělaná aplikace k účtům | Nefunguje na Pixel 6 | Oproti equa aplikaci je tato velmi pomalá. | doesnt lanuch on WSA | Jini pomerne zvladli prechody mezi přihlášením, odhlášením a klicem. Jini ale hure. Zde nižší prumer. Ovsem conveniently nefunkcni tlacitko zpět je moc hezky pocin. 😉 🙂 | Compared to Equa bank app, but also to mBank one, this Reiffeisen one is the most counter-intuitive banking app I've seen. Base functionalities like SEPA payments or standing orders are really painful. Push notifications are duplicated (for card payments: first blocked, than debited) which is quite annoying. Please fire your UX designer and find a better one. I'd say whoever designed Equa app could be a good candidate. Edit: OMG, it's not even possible to change your PIN in the app 🤦‍♀️ | Velice zakladni aplikace/ zadne moderni funkce (v. Karta, vlastni investice, jednorazove karty....) + 2-4 do tydne nejde spustit!!! | App is not able to download data and fails to load the loading screen... very annoying... | Great application with all necessary features. Please add an instant one-time virtual card for online shopping. | App is ok but I would add the total amount of money present in the account next to every movement in the list, as a reference for the user in keep tracking of ins and outs | I am not receiving any notifications ever, even tho my settings are correct. The app itself is not cool at all. | The administration of this bank is corrupt and racist towards foreigners. Case example, EquaBank opened accounts for the incoming students.. now they have taken over the bank and don't approve the accounts. | never works why u need it | overall this app is good enough for use of base features. the big disadvantage for me is that tech support periods take a lot of time. It's terrible because during this period you cannot do anything with your accounts online. for example, yesterday I couldn't transfer money between accounts while being in a grocery shop | I was moved from te equabank app and the raiffeisen app is a lot more unclear, especially around data on payments and notifications of payments that seem to arrive several days later. it has also been in maintenance mode during the day several times now.

What a shame.."",""Edit my review, as the initial inability to activate it via internet banking has now been worked around by RB by adding the ability to activate via RB klíč app (that has been forced upon everyone before). It's an okay banking app, but it has no useful features comparing to web banking (and thus superfluous): no push notifications on card transactions and account charges, for example (and e-mail ones are still range from barely useful to useless in the case of non-CZK currency charges)."",""Equabank app was way better. This redesigned app is very slow and missing many features. Many of them might even prevent some users from using it (font sizes, no idea why you went with such a small font, that cannot be adjusted, it should respect OS settings), also It's hard to navigate. Another useful feature that Equa had was to generate confirmation about receiving payment. Also account list is useless in your app, in Equa it auto generated a new record and it was very easy to navigate those."",""The app is terrible. It's very difficult and complicated to navigate through it, it's not intuitive at all, and the overview of the income and outcome is really bad. They took over Equa bank recently, and they should look up to Equa bank's app to make it more user friendly. I use Raiffeisen app only when I have to, otherwise I'd happily delete it.""]",false,false,false,"cz.rb.app.smartphonebanking","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.rb.app.smartphonebanking&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Jinak skoro nepouzitelne i na rychlych telefonech. Jen zbytecne zabira v telefonu misto. | Pomali of | Dal bych méně, ale nejde to. | Great | Very bad performance even on latest phone. Clicking on mail icon on the left doesn't work sometimes. | I need simple 2FA not another browser. Please add support for TOTP authenticator apps. | Very bad taste. Who is your targeted audience? How do I block this poore taste vomit (extra) and get real content instead? | I'm pleased with it | Nice | Like | Not working. Not able to perform 2-factor auth, because this app wont even start. Well Done.

It's only in czech and you need a seznam account to sign in. Uninstalled. | Snazim sa stiahnut si tu appku, ale pise mi ze ju mam nainstalovanu. Pravda je taka ze som ju mal nainstalovanu kvoli inemu uctu asi tiez kvoli 2FA, ale odinstaloval som ju a teraz ju tam nemam. Nepouzivam mobil na citanie mailov. V com je prosim problem ? Dakujem. | Děkuji, ale nemůžu použivat překlad slova klepnutim a celou stranky v seznam zspravy - u navstaveny tato zapnouto, ale vubec nefunguje. Pomoc mí prosím Vás, moc potřebuju. Snažil se v Miui 10 a Oxygen Os na Android Pie. Děkuji moc. Moc se omluvam, aplikace překlada, ale z cizeho jazuku na česky. Má možnost překladat z češtiny do ruštiny? Učim se česky a to bylo moc dobře. Chci čist seznam zspravy a učit se česky. Moc děkuji! | I'd give it 5 stars if it's available in English | Aplikace absolutne debilni.

Je to pro každém otevření. Mohli byste mi prosím poradit co to je? Dík | Bad | slow and unfriendly but it works. Latest versions are integrated with all functions of seznam and it is too much. it worked better when it was a simple email client. | Ještě se mi nepodařilo, aby aplikace načetla přílohu k odesílanému emailu. Když se ani na posedmé nenačte fotka, kterou potřebuji odeslat, bez ohledu na to, jestli ji zmenším, nebo ne, mám chuť, trísknout s telefonem o zem. Nepodařilo se mi ani přijít na to, jak označit všechny položky ve složce. Vyprázdnit spam, nebo obchodní sdělení  je tak hotové peklo. Označovat jednu položku po druhé je holý nesmysl. Najít způsob, jak napsat nový email mi také zabralo pár chvil. Celkově mi přijde aplikace neintuitivní a nedotažená. | Není to ono ... | Celkom dobrý prehliadač ale nie je taký rýchly ako napríklad Chrome. | Chtěl bych se zeptat, jestli máte v plánu udělat váš slovník jako aplikaci, protože tento slovník hodnotím lépe než jakýkoliv slovník díky počtu nabízených frází a příkladů vět, kde by se dané slovíčko mohlo vyskytovat.

I should have the option to remove this garbage | Excellent | Hacked | I have to give it 1 star simply because Samsung does not allow us to select the location on my phone's SD card to backup to, and after backing up, no information is given where it is. I've looked in my sd card, can't find it. Ridiculous. I don't want to back up using this silly app some more or I'll just clog up my sd card with invisible Samsung backups. And there isn't even a 'restore' option given. For goodness sakes. | This app never works. Piece of garbage | Best App to transfer A-Z all data from one Samsung phone to another Samsung phone. You can transfer you call log, Contacts, Mail accounts, photos, vedios and all other data through 1 click . Very helpful ☺️☺️ | Great | Ok | Ready and easy to use | Best this app | Good aps | Overall, good Samsung Smart switch is very simple and straightforward if you want to switch from one to another at the touch of your fingertips. Would definitely recommend this app to friends and family. | Delete | Did not let me use it | I'm interesting the game but were the money I'm getting to get now | Sucks | Server address | Works as expected, easy and fast to use | Great 👍 | Good | Edit: it works! Thank you for the developer response. This app works. Doesn't work. Made me update smart switch on my old device several times. I tried doing it over computer as well. | Awesome thanks | 5 stars | My phone's screen went blank. How can I recover data from my old phone? | Great great | Stop installing yourself | ""Transfer all"" doesn't transfer samsung notes... seems like a pretty big thing to overlook. My transfer from the s8+ to s21 ultra moved the notes fine, but s21 ultra to s24 ultra didn't. I didn't have to use my notes until I wiped and sent samsung my old phone. 12 years of notes gone because ""transfer all"" doesn't transfer all... | Can't updste on my new S24 Ultra | Good | You can't uninstall this app it stays on your phone and there is no way to get rid of it there is no uninstall for this app | Ok | नीस ब्रो | Never have used this. | Good | Keep smart features | Samsung insists that this app will automatically backup my Galaxy watch but that's a complete lie. I have all settings correct yet my watch will not back up. FIX IT NOW SAMSUNG!! GIVE ME BACK THE MANUAL BACKUP BUTTON OR I'M SWITCHING TO APPLE!! | ,. Rtu T. T..? Rw. . | love it great app | Fantastic! | Thank you, I'm definitely going to ask some questions about things I can do to trigger backups. I got it to restore my watch thankfully. | My phone galaxy s10 plus was run over by a car. I can't get the code for the 2 step varification. How can I download its content | Worst app ever | Excellent | flawless contact transfer, no cable needed! | Got my data transfered all good | Im | 👍. | Worked fine and quickly. Thank you! | Great app | J ja gihhizg | Good | I recommend you do not download this app it is a total waste of time and is Spyware by Samsung Korea avoid this download you do not need it you'd be better off transferring by cable. | Unusable for backup because it cannot deal with partial permissions. If it isn't installed, it triggers periodic notificarions. This is just bad deaign. Please fix. | I already downloaded two apps for this watch (Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Health). A third app for one device seems more like marketing/sales motivation, than an actual need. Feel like it is time to move away from Samsung devices. | Non use | ✌️good | No you can't Install appliances from a unknown source!!! What is wrong with this app:( ERROR ) | Gof | Hbllo | Got my new 24+ phone. Tried to transfer from S20 FE. The new 24+ says it needs to update Smart Switch. I try to update and it hangs showing ""Pending..."". Not impressed. Samsung you want your $1500 phone back. I can easily go with a Google phone. | Very good | Excellent Greatest | Used to remote access phone by rogue Google developer | Have a little trouble getting in but on some men. I'll let you know how much I like it thank you | Fast! N Easy! | Only used a couple of times haven't got to use it recently | Good | Why u adding additional apps to download? No need | Samsung | why can i not update this application? | Didn't get Gmail notifications once I transferred from galaxy tab a9 to s23 ultra. I reset s23 to factory settings, and it works fine. I won't trust the app anymore because I missed an important email. Please test your app before release. | Samsung Galaxy Watch backup requires this app, yet it is not clear why I need to give the App full level of permissions to almost any kind of action + data change on my phone (not watch). It's also not giving you clear information about the full scope of data changes it would be doing... I'd give minus stars if it was an option and this would probably be the reason to switch to another brand in the future, unless this is timely resolved to an acceptable level. EDIT: Dev not even understanding... | Good | Won't back up unless all permissions on phone are given regardless if the watch even uses the feature. Won't backup if at least 20% of battery on phone. I can see it saying may not fully backup but this is ridiculous. | I've lost connection trying to transfer data from my iPhone to my new phone about 5 times. I had to wait hours for it just to tell me at the end the connection is lost. Find a better way to transfer data from my iPhone to android because this app is useless. I've lost connection using the wire on my phone, which doesn't even make sense because it's connected through the wire. Also, the wireless option doesn't ever work because it never connects to my phone. So I can't even use it as an option. | Horrible. Would not update. | This takes forever | Useless kept trying to update,only downloaded an hour before gave up and downloaded about 50 apps manually ,first day with my new Samsung never had any problems with my Nokia!! | 👍 | app connection doesn't work. never has caught calls. Displaying "" hit a snag "" SHUTTING DOWN. Will not allow me to reinstall the app. Will not BE ABLE TO USE THIS APPLICATION FOR THE PURPOSE IT IS INTENDED. GETTING ANGRY !!!!!! | Zašto ne omogućite ""ignore"" ako ne ""uninstall"", ali ne samo za ovaj app već za hrpu koje su nametnute, a od prvoga dana pa niti nakon godinu dana nisu jednom korištene, već samo zauzimaju prostor i živciraju kod ažuriranja app koje želim ažurirati? Naročito za app koje Samsung nameće, a ne želim ih ili ste sami proglasili ne-kompatibilnima. Uskoro i Vi čete morati odblokirati poput Iphonea kad EU komisija naredi i naplati kazne.

Two transactions of a total of $65 were attemped. Dont use this app. Its a fishing scam. | Wow. Samsung cares less about customers than I imagined. Videos, web browsing are all inhibited inexplicably. Photos and videos are on ""samsumg cloud"" which is no longer accessible. | Okay | You do not 2ork | Ok | Bad | Great | Excellent | Literal clowns. Backup on the PC hangs with only 1.5 GB of data to transfer. The high frequency audio? Doesn't work. Connect via Wi-Fi? Nope, even on the same network. This app is a joke and the devs should never be allowed to code again. Edit: After purchasing a cable just to transfer my data, your app then only copied one of four accounts. SmartSwitch also only functioned at all when my Pixel's new phone procedure forced it to. Trying to use it again to get other data? Nope.

How do I get it off my cellphone permantly? | No words just yes | This app can hack your devices. I would have given it no star.

Trashware Edit: 3 Sterne weil man anscheinend updates rückgängig machen kann. Trotzdem keine gute Lösung, wäre mir lieber, wenn man die Wahl hätte updates zu installieren.

It only works if you have a higher Android Phone UI, depending on your Model Type; otherwise, it won't work with a much older Cell Phone, with a less UI, let alone, if you don't have wireless, because it does NOT transfer data. Better, to Screenshot or USB, from another source all of your important Passwords, from your Apps, Contacts, etc., to your Phone manually; itwould probably less risk of bringing unnecessary junk to your new Phone."",""It does help, but the ads are annoying AND misleading. Some look like part of the app, and someone lacking my keen technical acuity ;) could get confused and screw things up. Ads make it quite cumbersome. Cabled transfer did not work at all.

New content coming out will be amazing and disney is putting all efort in make the app work. The video quality looks better then netflix as well. | Poor, sorry, no extremely poor not a patch on Netflix, locks up, doesn't remember where I got to in a series. Chromecast works sometimes. | Cannot log in, keeps flashing screens | I love this I can watch the eras tour movie!! | Crashing...doesn't work...fix it!!!! | No mean girls or teenage cracken?!! | Won't install. The app was working fine then I was forced to have this update however it keeps failing the install. Now I'm wasting the cost of my subscription and will need to quit. | Its good quite good there are lots of new great movies and tv series that i rate massively, and over all its a good app | Dis Card | Love that I can watch all the Star Wars, Marvel and the old Disney movies that I grew up on. It's Amazing!!!!!! | Great time | good | I like it | App update requested, updated and now it won't start | Poor quality 😞 | Unlimited hotel and food accommodation | It even has old shows and old movies and it has something where you can find stuff just by taking in to your remote! | Just crashes when I open it now | I can never watch Disney on my mobile phone . Just keeps asking me to update it | Crashes | Really good, just needs an auto play feature. | As much as I like Disney+, what happened to the no-ads option for just Disney Plus? I would really like to see that again. | I have always loved Disney Movies he was / is talented and his Movies are all well made he picks the best Actors for his characters. Man was a genius in deed! 🙏❤️😊🥰 | Marvelous | its a lot of disney movie in one place! I can watch from anywhere to, but it is really hard to do a groupwatch and especially on tv. on my phone I cant do groupwatch because it lags to bad, but otherwise its a great app. | crashes every time i try to open the app, so i constantly have to uninstall it | I can watch offline!! it sucks!!!! | The best because I can watch Disney wherever I go | amazing | Lab Rats Bree 1.95x Speed | Was going to sign sack up for a month.

To 56winsin city us | IT LITERALLY ENTERTAINS ME ALL DAY WHEN I AM BORED I GO STRAIGHT TO DISNEY+ SO THANK YOU | woke rubbish | App doesnt even load - Xperia 1 ii on Android 12 | While the app does a decent job showing content, it's not adept at showing offline content. I'm sure that in some circumstances it can show content that was downloaded for offline viewing, but not any time I've tried to use it. The app insisted on needing a connection which it wasn't going to get as I was on a long haul flight over the Atlantic at the time. I wasn't about to pay the airline $20/£20 to let the app phone home so I could watch content I'd downloaded only four hours before. | App is unusable at the moment. Asks to be updated all the time and then doesn't work .can we get a refund? Very frustrating | Slow, glitches, downloads do not work half the time if there is no internet. Log in is a mess. | App keeps crashing | broken. broken broken. cant even open app. uninstaol. reistanll. nitjing like paying for a servide we csnt use | app keeps crashing | Love it has absolutely everything | Not on par with functionality from other streaming apps. However, biggest issue for me personally is 4:3 shows like early seasons of Simpsons cut and cropped to fit in 16:9, missing a lot of great detail/context. It would be better to keep 4:3 and show pillar boxes. It's been raised by many since Disney+ was launched in 2020, but no movement on fixing it. | Lower your prices | Can't watch anything cause its just freezing up on every movie. I cancelled it 2 yes ago for this same reason. An yet 2024 they can't fix anything.. very annoyed since I have to pay good money an cant watch anything.. I want my money back asap | Laggy and stupid on android TV. | Am Shariff your app does not work | Very horrible app. Takes too long to load a few minutes of a movie! Such a shame! I love the list of movies, but watching them is like torturing myself :( | Great | Worsr | I will be trying to watch a movie and it wont let me it keeps on going back to my home screen | Connection | awesome app. lots of great shows and movies at a good subscription orice | App stopped loading so I uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing 🤦🏻‍♀️ not sure if there's been any recent updates but they've crashed the app on my phone completely | the best | App keeps crashing. I've cleared data & catche, forced stopped, uninstalled and reinstalled. Phone is up to date. | I wanted to put a zero star review because I'm trying to log in my Disney account, but it isn't letting me in. After a while of trying I deleted the app and reinstalled but now it isn't letting me into the app now. Please fix this problem soon and I'll change my review | Does not work with android I | its disney and amazing | It's got some good shows and such but I really hate that the auto continue doesn't work. So after every episode you have to get your phone and click play on the next episode or it'll just stop. Already tried logging in and out. Uninstalling and reinstalling. It's annoying as | At first the app was fine, loaded fast and was actually working. Right now i cant even open it. | buffering | Change malaysia region, then I can use this program | Lots of great shows (mostly) to enjoy on a lazy weekend! | The app keeps crashing, over and over. | love it | Yes it a good app but you get what you pay for okay I'ma tell you that so if you go cheap you get ads and if you go expensive there's no ads but it is expensive every month and you will get notifications talking about you have not paid your monthly month payment for Disney Plus all I want to say is just that Disney plus don't play about the money and if you don't pay on time you will not be watching Disney 😂😂😂 lol | Constantly logs me out. And having to log back in on a streaming device is a headache. And it always tells me my password is wrong for some reason. You know, it wouldn't be a problem if you WOULDNT LOG ME OUT ALL THE TIME. I'm done. I'm canceling Disney+. You guys have done me dirty for the last time. You're done. No second chances. | No se puede ver lo que descargas, a menos que estés conectado a internet (???) | The amount of ads is ridiculous. Should be about 70% less | App works great and I like the accessibility to cool movies, shows, and nature documentaries :) | Disney ruins everything they touch | Please fix Disney Plus it keeps saying that it's not working | Crashing on launch | There is no way to update payment after your original card has been compromised. I have tried for 4 days now to update my card on several devices from where my card was stolen, and it just keeps redirectme to the play store and I go to my subscriptions and then can't find Disney plus any where in it I've switched through to my other 2 emails to find it and it's like it doest exist and I've tried to contact them about it multiple times w/no luck | I love this app it has so nostalgia | it's awesome | It was a 5 until Taylor Swift HAS HER OWN DINEY MOVIE NEVER WATCHING DISNEY | Currently can't open the app or log into the page on a browser so frankly paying for nothing | Tohight | Prices keep hiking, plus it stopped in the middle of what I was watching to request for feedback, I hate that. will be cancelling soon after I've finished what I want. | Paying subscription is impossible after you forget to pay before they cancel. After they cancel, good luck. | I think it's has great movies and great quality 👌 | Won't update | Why is there a tiered system now? It's just made me want to use the service less. | I'm really enjoying my Disney app, at home, and on my phone between duties at work. Disney's partnerships provide me with a wide range of fantastic programming, and I couldn't be happier with it. | It's great Taylors movie is so gooooood slay it's so cute | Half the time wont even open | it's so good thumbs up 👍 | you have made amazing this amazing that I can watch all my favourite films on my games console and you should keep up the amazing work 😁 | Updated now crashes immediately | I love this app its great | I love this | Unable to download shows for offline viewing. Stopped working a month ago | I love the Disney Plus app because of the content on it and films mn it and I can watch it if I was on holiday I have got it on not just on my phone and my tablet as well and it is a wonderful app to have if I was board from watching the TV and YouTube TV as well | Update downloading but not installing | It's amazing | Horrible app... has trouble loading on our TV, hasn't worked for two days, even after uninstalling, and will only work (sometimes) on our tablets. Randomly hides the show that my son likes, and I you have to go search for it. My guess is to make you look at other shows, but most of the shows on the app I wouldn't let my kids watch. | App crashes when open | Use this app daily and then it kicked me put. Now i cant get into it at all just asks for email and no passwords. | worst app of all time. literally impossible to even open the app to watch downloaded content on a flight. what a waste. | App doesn't load I get the blue background, no splash screen no homepage loads | 100out of100 | So far, I have been enjoying it. I am able to watch old and recent movies. | I would give them zero Stars if I could they stole money from my dead mom and my account months after I canceled her subscription, shameless in stealing a man's money on behalf of his dead mom | never streams I will have to leave this app soon | Samsung s23 ultra.. App keeps closing.. Deleted data, cache and uninstall and re installed.. Not working (worked last week before update.. Thanks disney!) | I like the content but the app is horrible. Downloads often will get stuck or not load, especially when the app is in the background. After a few days downloads often can't be played anymore and have to be deleted. If you press play on a movie that is downloaded from the home tab and not the download tab it will start streaming it instead of playing the download version which cost me most this months mobile data. Horrible app | It's all right. | Crashes- won't open | Neverloadsapp withnewupdate lowes ratting you can give why Iam ipaying wont let me post | It's not just bad, it's awful. The quality of modern-day shows/ movies is horrendous. In particular, Marvel & Star Wars content. Lots of 'highlighted' Specialist programmes that cater for the minority are grossly inappropriate for kids. Now you pay extra for 4k content and ad-free access to this rubbish!? | every time I click on the app it will show the Disney symbol for a couple of seconds and then it goes back to my home screen. I've tried uninstalling updates and and reinstalling but the app will not open. it works on my other TVs but not on my most recently purchased smart Google TV from Sony which defeats the whole purpose of me buying a nicer TV with Disney plus but this is supposed work but for some reason the app is cutting itself off | I love | Video never loads and it always prompt passcode on own device every time the app is opened. Subscription doesn't explain difference between the prices. Downloaded video doesn't start when offline. | HIGHLY RECOMMEND Disney+ we got the cheapest one for $7.99 with the ads. We are already in love with it wish we would have got it sooner but got it now! | You can't run that many ads and charge people smh ridiculous 🤦 network television has less and way more content for free you have a watch for a month and leave service 😒 | I have disney plus on my laptop and I am trying to get it on my phone so I can download movies so I can watch them when I am on a plane. Get it so I can download movies on my laptop. That is why I got a laptop and disney plus | its green | Satan owns Disney. | Immediately crashes and closes out when I try to open it now | amazing nadigas toilet | In the middle of the movie, It just pops up, give me a star. Isn't the money enough to fill you? | I can't watch normally, the videos are constantly freezing while only the audio is played | Wont update. | माहि रानी | Doesn't want to accept payments. | It's family guy | Disney is the best ! and I love all the movies and shows | as a bilingual family it's great to be able to choose the language on many of the productions. the reason it's not 5 stars is the limitations in filtering age related content. I.e. my son is 3yo, and I'd prefer a profile setting with productions suitable for his age only, and not 6+ included, as the nearest setting allows for. | The best | Webpage continues to reload endlessly on multiple different browsers and on desktop computers same as the app, says account not subscribed (even though it is) yet doesn't allow you to click anywhere to update payment method or start a subscription, we pay for working service, make it work and work better then just meh | The app runs pretty poorly on Android. It never stays open in the background, it's slow to open and most of the time it does not cast well, especially when you're letting it play from episode to episode, the connection breaks. | More movies then 5 | please choose vegan and get healthy again. wildlife is getting hurt not enough guards. and all around keeping up is needed and it's showing affect all over the world please keep up. saint, # depense' # | Stop the woke nonesense. Making a different section for black people or for women just enforces the fact of finding differences and division. Just make good content. | App won't open!! Downloads are super slow even when fast wifi!!! | put the movie app | I'm giving this rating because of xmen 97 and storm | all that money spent on content and they couldn't bother at least paying for the good duct tape to hold the app together. | Lost yet another ☆ & I'll explain Y- the downloading experience sucks. U download episodes and IF it decides to work, they'll still expire so if you have bad internet and go out to a place with WIFI to download things for later, you might get hit with it needing the internet to verify ur account AGAIN despite the fact that it should be able to TELL when your account would expire (read: not anytime soon) Also it'll break if it detects an app update. I legit miss DVDs bro. Why do I pay for this?? | Loved the Taylor Swift ❤️ 💕 concert!!! It was fantastic with all her costume changes,beautiful energy,so rocking it and having so much fun doing it!! | Getting a lil too expensive for me, the ads in some of these shows are crazy too. Might as well go back to cable | You pay for an ad free annual, it still has ads. Show content not very good. Bought Star Wars and now the theatrical ""Canon"" , pretty much ruined. I am not looking at keeping this app come next year. | go back to good wholesome programs and remove the new woke agenda garbage. then you will happily get five stars and a returning customer. | Always have a hard time adding this to my TV.

A bug fix here. An update there. We hope you find your streaming experience even better.","[""Content is fine but of all the streaming service apps on my phone, this is by far the worst especially when casting to a TV. The app frequently doesn't keep track of progress. Skipping intros / recaps has to be done on your phone rather than TV (why???). Likewise if you want to skip to next episode when the credits role, you'll need your phone again. Random error messages, buffering bar randomly appears even when it's not buffering. Disney please view other apps to inspire you to improve your's."",""Very poor quality app, takes forever to load and always has errors. Other streaming service apps do much better. It's a shame because there's so many good things to watch on disney but I can't be bothered to deal with the glitch app most of the time. Chromecast is almost impossible to getting working and take minimum 5 minutes to load when it does work!"",""This is the worst app ever. It is glitchy, constantly quitting. Ridiculous. I expect much better from a company like Disney. Also, why not have a queue feature? If you have 7m shorts it would be nice to be able to string them together. Or playing collections as a playlist, like being able to watch all of the Treehouse of Horrors, for example, together instead of it going to the next ep in the season."",""The content is great but the app has a lot of bugs room for improvement. Navigating in the app is very slow. The app start-up is even slower. Offline handling is not good. Downloading takes too long. Downloads disappeared several times, then had duplicates(?). I lose my progress regularly; the video just starts from the beginning. Screen gets dimmed on low light and no shortcut to adjust. These are just the actual problems I'm facing. There are also a bunch of things that just could be improved."",""The app is near unusable now. It's painfully slow, streaming content rarely works and required multiple restarts, progress is never saved when watching something and manually navigating to a time stamp is unbearable. Trying to continue watching a film last night ended up in nothing but frustration and we found it much easier from another source. Congratulations on making watching your content so frustrating, you're making piracy popular again.""]",false,false,false,"com.disney.disneyplus","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.disneyplus&hl=en&gl=CZ"
"Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu","The eGovernment Mobile Key application for the Android mobile platform, issued by the Ministry of the Interior, enables easy and fast login to Data Boxes and a number of other public administration web applications without the need to enter a complex name and password.
To use in data boxes, install the Mobile Key application on your mobile phone or tablet and connect it to your user account in Data Boxes (Settings - Login Options - Mobile Key Login). To log in to the Data Boxes, all you have to do is log in to the Mobile Key with your fingerprint (or PIN, password or image password - of your choice) and download the QR code on the login page.
 You can connect one Mobile Key to multiple data boxes. After logging in with the Mobile Key, the Data Boxes will then offer you a selection of all available user accounts.
 Notifications of new messages in your data mailbox may also be delivered to the Mobile Key.
 There are several options for logging in via the National Point. After installing the application on your mobile phone, you can either transfer your identity from the data box to the National Point or pair the Mobile Key application with your existing National Point account using another electronic means of login or you can contact the public administration contact point ( Czech POINT) to open a new account in the National Point.
The mobile key requires Android version 4.4 or higher to run and the screen lock on (it must not be possible to unlock the device by simply sliding the screen, the unlock pattern, PIN or password must be set).
If your device has a fingerprint reader and Android at least 6.0, you can sign in to your Mobile Key with your fingerprint.
To log in to Data Mailboxes, you need to have an internet or tablet access to the Internet - it doesn't matter if it's via mobile data or Wi-Fi.
 The Mobile Key application only provides secure login without the need to enter login details. The access to the data box itself (reading messages) continues in the web browser - the application does not provide anything other than login (and delivery of notifications).

Každopádně mě pobavila ještě jedna věc. Při neúspěšné autentifikaci otiskem mi vyhrožuje, že se smaže a budu muset na Czech Point, tak při změně otisků prstů, to po mě nechce nic. Třeba banka automaticky vypne autentifikaci otisky, dokud se nepřihlásím heslem, tady nic. Takže pokud někdo prolomí zařízení a přidá si otisk, tak může beztrestně komunikovat mým jménem se státem. | App crashes after scan | Skvělý nástroj pro snadné, pohodlné a bezpečné přihlašování do státních aplikací bez nutnosti zadávat heslo | Je zapotřebí PC k aktivaci, vzhledem k několikanásobnému potvrzování přihlášení. Co když někdo nemá PC? | Nelze inteligentně provozovat, protože ""Obrazovka je překryta jinou aplikací"" i když ta aplikace je Bitwarden, správce hesel. Musím ji pokaždé zakázat. Aby to fungovalo. Rozumím že je to pro ""bezpečí"" protože běžný uživatel=hlupák, ale nepomohlo by varování, že obrazovka je překryta touto aplikací, chcete opravdu pokračovat? Důvěřuje této aplikaci? Atd, než to rovnou blokovat? Platí také pro aplikace pro ""Samsung One UI Good Lock"", kde stejný problém dělá také ""RegiStar"" z ""Good Lock"". | Cool app, thanks to Check's government for so convenient thing. | Not intuitive | Horší aplikaci už jsem dlouho neviděl. Při onPause aplikace crashne. UI/UX designer na projektu asi zrovna chyběl a vlastně asikace nic moc neumí. Prosím dělejte to pořádně a testujte po sobě svojí práci. | Please add the English language. It is stressful and painful. Thank you. | Zatím žádné potíže. Instalace byla bezproblémová a dělá to přesně co se z ní očekává. Scanning QR kódů též bez potíží. Těším se na odklon od desítek nepropojených systémů směrem k lepší integraci dat a systémů v e-government aby uživatel měl vše jednoduše při ruce na jednom místě.. Simplify, simplify, simplify! | Tragický pokus o práci s přihlášením, datovou schránkou a dvoustupňovou autorizaci: neustále se člověk musí znova a znova přihlašovat v průběhu práce s aplikací. Chybí menu, nápověda i celková transparence a přístupnost. | Works well. Camera focus had some issue, need to restart the app always so the qr code can be read | Funguje dle očekávání. | Please add English option. It's digitally possible. It's really complicated for an expat to manage his life already. | Aplikace poskytuje komfortní, rychlou a bezpečnou autentikaci uživatele do systémů různých úřadů. | K ničemu, nemůžu se přihlásit, neexistuje reset hesla. Česká republika úplně pozadu, pro někoho kdo žije v zahraničí je tohle spíš problém než užitek. | I would expect a bit better software development from government app. Absolutely complicated in stupid non functional way. Works worse than some apps from early 2000's.... | Dělá, co má | Aplikace konstantne crashuje a propojeni s identitou obcana mission impossible:( | Ono to nečekaně vážně funguje. | Dělá to, co má | Funguje jak ma. | Prostě funguje, co dodat | works pretty well, would be nice to combine multiple government apps to one | Často nejde naskenovat qr kód | Aplikace hned po startu končí chybovým hlášením že je překryta jinou aplikací. Přitom mám jenom v záhlaví a mimo obrazovku této aplikace Network Monitor který je bezpečný. | Podezrela aplikace chce ukrast kontakty... | easy to use | Log in via QR code works with some problems, multiple attempts are required for confirmation in my case. Otherwise app is working good. | Šrot, ale co už | Funguje jak má... Co více si přát! | Státem vynucená datová schránka, kde si ročně můžete platit až 29500 Kč za uložení 5000 zpráv? No to je teda dobrý vtip! Nabízeno se slovy ""Šetří vaše náklady"". Zloději. Doporučuji všem datovka.cz od společnosti nic.cz | Ikdyž změním heslo, pin, nebo obrázkové heslo a ihned potom se zkusím přihlásit, způsobem, že na dialogu s otiskem kliknu ""cancel"" a následně vyplním nové heslo/pin/obrázkové heslo, vždy to při pokusu o přihlášení napíše ""nesprávné heslo"". Přihlášení pomocí otisku funguje. | Prosím napište mi. Rád, státu pomůžu napsat mobilní aplikací, která bude splňovat standardy UX/UI 21. století. Bude přehledná, bezpečná, rozšiřitelná, vícejazyčná atd. Za soucasnou verzi se jako občan a profesí programátor vážně stydím. | Snímač qr kódu skoro nefunguje | Při načítání QR kódu pro připojení k identitě občana se nejprve zobrazí zpráva ""Generování komunikačních klíčů, prosím čekejte"" a po chvíli chybová hláška: ""Nastala chyba komunikace se serverem, opakujte požadavek později."" Při opakovaném pokusu (zkoušel jsem cca 10x) pořád stejný problém. Kde je chyba a co mám dělat? Připojení k internetu mám všechny ostatní aplikace fungují normálně. | nefunguje mi potvrzení přihlášení pro weby přímo na mobilu, jinak bez problémů | Jednoduchý způsob přihlášení k identitě občana. Prostě to funguje. | Zabudované, nedostanu se přes úvodní notifikaci o aplikacích na pozadí. Nejde kliknout. Pixel 4a, A12. | Dělá co má, ale plný počet hvězdiček si nezaslouží, protože v roce 2022 je neakceptovatelné, že aplikace nemá anglickou mutaci. | Zatim funguje bez problemu a rychle | Easy to use | Super zjednodušení přístupu do datovky a k ostatním věcem vyžadující e-identitu. | Aplikace dělá, co má, snadno přihlašuje občana na různé portály přes národní identifikační bod a vše trvá jen chvilku. Mám však pár bodů pro zlepšení: - Při přihlašování na telefonech s aplikací není potřeba spouštět fotoaparát. Na telefonech střední a nižší třídy bývá tato operace docela pomalá. - Samotné načtení QR kódu není příliš svižné, v jiných aplikací funguje načítání okamžitě (i na telefonu střední třídy), zde musí telefon pár vteřin mířit na QR kód. | Great, just works | laughable, software languages do not work properly (half/half) get your @%^#@% in order! before rolling out software that has not been fully tested. your software designers are morons. Response: your website was down TODAY for hours. Can't login. Application didn't mention it. After hours of trying to login for humanitarian aid. I decided to try the actual website, the message indicated the login process is not possible. This information would be helpful if the application mentioned it!! | Po naskenování QR kódu mě otravuje ještě nutnost přihlášení potvrzovat. Pokud se přihlašuji z prohlížeče z mobilu (tj. bez skenování) stejně se v aplikaci zobrazí nesmyslně obraz z kamery. Také by mohlo být intuitivnější první nastavení pro neznalé uživatele. Jinak jsem spokojený. | Nefunkční záloha klíče. Nepoužitelné. | Nepoužitelné | English please | Please add an option for English. With the complicated Czech, as someone who struggles with the Czech language, it's nearly impossible to figure out what I need. And since certain expats need this application for government related things, it really should be a top priority. | Upozorňuje na zprávy datovky a pouští mě přes otisk prstu na ověření všech portálů co potřebuji. Živnosťák, Datovka, Zdravotko... Pro cizince je to nepříjemně matoucí proces se snahou o získání výpisu z rejstříku ale to má dost možná víc společného s CzechPointama | Funkční. | Does not work on LG phones, due to com.lge.globaltofservice apparently drawing over the screen. Takže si to spravte. | so unnecessary complicated | Tohle snad delalo stado debilu.Bezte se s timhle bodnout.Tak to je ta digitalizace a la Debilistan. | Nelze spustit kvůli ""překrytí obrazovky jinou aplikací"", přestože všechna překrytí (včetně těch, co jsou součástí OS) jsou vypnutá. Zařízení Samsung Galaxy s21 ultra, žádný root | Dog shiit as application scam. Be warned. | This app not rule safety pass check. Be carefully using this.. | Nesrozumitelný způsob připojování k jednotlivým bodům. Povedlo se mi pouze zprovoznit datové schránky. | Nikdy nefunguje vygenerování zcela nových klíčů pro Czech Point po zadání telefonního čísla (zkoušel jsem zadávat s i bez +420). Pokaždé dojde na chybu serveru a mám zkoušet prý později. Po strávení celého dopoledne touto kratochvílí aplikaci mažu a rozhodně nikomu nedoporučuji. | Hnus! Nefunkční, zbytečně komplikovaný! | Po posledni aktualizaci silene ... cekat 20 sekund, na to, aby se jeste clovek prihlasil je ABSOLUTNE ZBYTECNA funkce!

Nevim proc v tomto pripade neprijde na radu 2 factor authrozice do appky, clovek chce neco vyresit podepsat a ne cekat nez se appka smiluje a da mu moznost zkusit se znova prihlasit! | Pokud má někdo problémy s rootnutým telefonem pomocí Magisku doporučuji použít vestavěnou funkci MagiskHide. | Can't be used if you not allow display reading by app. | Prostě boží :) Do Portálu občana se přihlásím otiskem a vyfocením QR. Na mobilu je integrace ještě jednodušší. Není co vytknout. | Warning about a possible hack when installing.The app can read what is on the display. | Jako aplikace ministerstva v roce 2021 je to opravdu zklamání. Hodně věcí dokonce nefunguje vůbec. | Funguje dobře zatím se vším, co umožňuje přihlášení pres eidentitu, spokojenost. | Nefunguje na telefonu který vlastním já a nikoliv Čínská Lidová Republika. Root je problém, ale aktualizace od Huawei jsou v pořádku. Od kdy je státu co do toho, jak zabezpečuji své zařízení? Příště mi bude kontrolovat jestli mám doma na rodný list trezor? | WTF.

It is a convoluted process with poor explanation and guide for someone who already uses the key for data mailbox and now adding eidentita.cz.

Nejdříve problémy s tím, že údajně nemám nastavený zámek otiskem prstu a teď po startu zamrzne na bílé obrazovce.

Ale, jednou jsem měl špinavou čtečku otisků a po pár pokusech se aplikace na pár minut zablokovala. Což je pochopitelné. Problém je, že už se nikdy znovu nerozběhla - po spuštění píše, že je zablokována do náhodného času (minulého či budoucího) a nelze s tím nic udělat. | Zbytečně komplikované řešení.

Zároveň probíhá odpočet 20 sekund, během kterých není možné aplikaci použít (bezpečnostní feature). Než při každém přihlašování čekat 20 sekund, budu raději používat standardní přihlašování pomocí hesla, dokud tato chyba nebude opravena. Update 10. 12. 2020: po updatu stále bliká screen.

Hmm vypadá to, že jste to špatně naprogramovali Díky. Ještě zkuste trošku poupravit ten design ať to nevypadá jako z roku 2010 | Aplikace po updatu při pokusu o otevření zasekne ve smyčce načítání a nejde ukončit. Pomůže akorát restart telefonu. EDIT: chyba opravena, aplikace dělá přesně, co má | Zatím mi appka vždy fungovala tak, jak jsem potřeboval. Otevřu, přihlásím se kam potřebuji a zavřu. Víc od appky nepotřebuji a přesně tohle appka dělá. | Have you guys ever heard of Google Password Manager? You don't really need to type the username and password again each time you want to login. Considering you say this app is an improvement to login process, you are truly wrong. Maybe it could at least show the received messages, but wait, it does not! | Myslím že negativní recenze jsou přehnané, funguje to velmi dobře. | Neužitečné. Nešetří čas ani nezvyšuje zabezpečení. Google nebo Microsoft Authenticator App by byl lepší. | Nenabizi se mi moznost prihlasovani otiskem prstu, přestože na mem telefonu v jinych aplikacich funguje. Telefon nemam v rezimu root. Update 10.4.2020: Problem pretrvava. Podle popisu aplikace by ctecka otisku prstu mela fungovat od Androidu 6.0.

Je určena k tomu, abych pořád dokola zadával QR kód? Tak by to mělo být v popisu. Já se chci na otisk prstu dostat do datové schránky!!! Nemohl by se nad celým konceptem datové schránky zamyslet někdo inteligentní a udělat jednu intuitivní aplikaci, která tuto funkcionalitu umožní? Nechci zadávat dokola QR kódy, piny ani nic dalšího. Chci si otevřít aplikaci Datová schránka, přiložit prst a prolistovat si, co mám v datové schránce. Dává to smysl? | Yay! | ""Aplikace je překryta jinou aplikací""... Pořád a stále dokola... A ne, nemám krom této aplikace nic jiného otevřeného | Po měsíci jsem znovu zkusil spárovat a stále se opakující smyčka... Tentokrát už hodnotím, protože neschopnost během měsíce reagovat na nemožnost aplikaci použít je neuvěřitelně | Pracuje, jak má (jak je popsáno v návodu). Umožňuje bezpečnější a jednoduché přihlášení k datové schránce a přitom zachovává (pokud si to sami nezakážete) i možnost přihlásit se jako dříve jenom jménem a heslem (o čemž vám vždy přijde notifikace na mobil s tímto klíčem, což je super bezpečnostní vychytávka). Umí i různé notifikace, je to fajn věc. | Není možné nastavit heslo pro přístup k aplikaci. Aplikace vyžaduje zámek obrazovky, který z jistých důvodů nepoužívám a používat nebudu. | Postupoval jsem podle návodu až k bodu ""Připojení Mobilního klíče k účtu je tím dokončeno a následuje ještě nastavení dalších možností:"".  Nyní když v mobilu spustím aplikaci, tak se objeví výzva ""Nasnímejte QR kód"". Ale to už jsem udělal !!! !!! | nefunguje pro vice DS | Při přechodu na pozadí aplikace pokaždé spadne. Po aktivaci a přihlášení se mi pořád zobrazuje obrazovka se skenovaním qr kódu. Nejsem schopen určit zda aplikace funguje, bojím se to používat, prosím vás o brzkou nápravu. | Jak uz psali i jini, po kazdem zapnuti a zadani pinu chce aplikace zase naskenovat QR kod, a tato smycka se porad opakuje. Co s tim? Apka by se hodila! | Ne funkcias kun radika atingo. Feliĉe ĝi estas nur malnecesa apo. | skvělá aplikace včetně webového zpracování. Určitě krok správným směrem. | Funguje:) | Funguje bez problémů na S10e. Zatím OK. | Nespustí se a tvrdí, že mam rootnutý telefon. Mám úplně běžný nemodifikovaný Galaxy S10e s posledními aktualizacemi. I root checker potvrdil, že nemám root. | Dobrý den, jak napáruji do aplikace druhou datovou schránku? Předpokládám, že více lidí má osobní a živnostenskou datovku. Jinak aplikace asi funguje tak, jak má. Děkuji . | Velká paráda. Zvládá více datových schránek. Přístup přes prohlížeč v mobilu si sám vyžádá spuštění aplikace. | Samozřejmě nefunguje a padá. Co taky čekat, že? Ani nelze ukončit párování.  Asi si mně někdo spletl s beta-testerem :-) | Nelze používat při rootu telefonu. | Povedená aplikace.

Jediné, co bych možná ocenil byl lepší přehled v grafech - posledních 30 dní/aktuální měsíc je poměrně málo, alespoň pokud by se ukládaly poslední 3 měsíce například, bylo by to moc super. | Aplikace funguje, což je ovšem požadované standardní chování, i když 3 měsíční nefunkčnost na Google Pixel, to byl fakt prima dárek od ČSOB. Hodnotím zcela absurdní Kate, která jen zabírá místo na hlavní ploše a jinak nenabízí žádny (opravdu ŽÁDNÝ!!!), pro mne VYUŽITELNÝ benefit. Jak dlouho budete s Kate klientům ještě otravovat život???!!! | Hrozná spam aplikace. Přijde notifikace, člověk čeká, že se jedná o nějaký příjem peněz, ale místo toho je to nějaká spam notifikace na nějaký ČSOB produkt... Reakce na odpověď: to je snad ten nejnešťastnější způsob odhlášení od spamu, jaký jsem kdy viděl.

Only if one could get rid of that ugly useless top banner section with links I never click. That would earn 5 stars from me. | Installed applications with overlay permission now emit warning only, which is fine by me. I am missing proper integration of investments insurance, mortgage, etc. into the app, without using WebView; possibility to cancel/edit account overdraft limit in app, option to chose non-ESG funds for ČSOB Drobné (I intentionally don't want responsible investments at all), and setting to make account logout interval longer when app is out of focus (as it is on desktop). | Using this app is like running on a minefield. Between my account balances I have to be careful not to accidentally press a loan arrangement button hiding between, a lease for car I don't have, a mortgage for a house I don't have or an insurance for pension I won't have... If I could I would bring this to the EU court for manipulative and unethical advertising practices, but I'm too broke and tired.. | Pri zobrazení pohybov sa nezobrazuje dátum platby, ale dátum kedy to zaregistrovala až banka a presunula z on hold do pohybov, čo je trochu zbytočnejší údaj, než vedieť deň kedy som vykonal platbu. | UPDATE 2 - po 3 měsících a novém updatu konečně! funguje, avšak běžně resetuje nastavení a chová se jako při prvním spuštění, takže pořád špatně....

It started to use system notifications to promote some ads. I didn't find a setting how to turn it off but at the first place I never allowed it! | Oh the worst bank ever. Terrible customer service and terrible deals from the bank. Never again! Totalni hov.dina | Long loading times, poor user interface, and an invasive ""personal assistant"" that sends you useless, unrelated notifications. Also, it only redirects you to rate the app if you say you like it. Negative ratings don't take you to the Play Store. | nefunguje | Source of never-ending spam notifications, those can not be turned off. If you turn them off, you lost failed payme t or card usage notifications. Typical czech product, poor design. Do not recommend it. | Sprostý nástroj na obtěžování pres E-Shop notifikace. Proč za to ti darebáci nedostanou 100.000Kc pokutu, jako jini, kteri obtezuji nevyžádanými reklamami lidi? | Po upgradu na android 14 aplikace nefunguje. Edit: aktualizoval jsem OS i aplikaci a stále nefunguje. Edit2: aplikace konečně znovu funguje. Díky za opravu. 🙂 | I'd really appreciate an increased number of ""envelopes"" in the savings account. Organizing money is key for financial health. The financial graph of incoming and outgoing payments could be made so much more useful by categorizing the transactions. Like guys, basically every bank has this, even UniCredit. Please improve and keep up the good work. | Update: After ""fixing the issue"" like CSOB says, its not even starting after reinstallation of the app, that means the app is now even less functional! Congratulations, you just proved me, that I have to change my bank, because having a completely non-functional banking app in the 21. century, and not being able to fix it for almost 2 months is frightening! Are you not testing your own app?? Before a new OS version is released, there is always a beta available, don't you know such basic things? | Představte si kejs, že chcete zjistit kdy jste naposledy zaplatili platbu skrze tempate. Zmapujte si tu zákaznickou cestu a dejte si facku. Vážně máte ""chytrou"" asistentku co mi to nenajde? Vážně search přehledu plateb neumí najít platby podle názvu templatu ani sakra čísla účtu? Vážně si proboha musím jít napsat z templatu na papír variabilní symbol a zadat ho ve fakin roce 2023 ručně do searche? Tohle je neschopnost a diletantství level 9000. Ty lidi co tohle vymejsli fakt vyhoďte. | Aplikace stále nefunguje i když tu ČSOB v komentářích tvrdí, že má pro své zákazníky ""dobré zprávy"" a že chyba byla odstraněna. Není to pravda, aplikace stále padá. Načítá se až tak na 5tý pokus a když se náhodou načte musíte projít úvodním procesem a znova si nahrát otisk prstu atd... Přístup ČSOB k tomuto problému je absolutně neprofesionální a nikdo neřeší problém s aplikací, raději vám napíšou ať si přeinstalujete systém, protože toto ""není chyba ČSOB"". Ne! Po přeinstalování chyba přetrvává | Strašně špatný. Neni to vůbec opravené, neustále padá při pokusech o spuštění, když se spuštění náhodou povede, je nutný celý zdlouhavý proces prvního přihlášení. Pak se to zavře a loterie znovu. Polovina úvodní obrazovky jsou prakticky reklamy. Mám pocit, že tam chybí tlačítko navíc za připlacení pro čistou přehlednou appku. K čemu je tam tlačítko pro organizaci, když ty nejotravnější prvky změnit nejdou? | Ani po 3-týždňovom čakaní na novú verziu, aplikácia stále nefunguje na modeloch Pixel 5 s Android 14 a pri prihlasovaní padá. Klientov banky s týmto modelom sú určite vyššie stovky alebo nižšie tisíce a veľmi ma mrzí ako to banka (ne)rieši. EDIT - ani po údajnej oprave, aplikácia stále nefunguje. Je to už skoro 2 mesiace. Prechádzam do Erste. | Aplikace k h....u. Nejde ani najít nejbližší pobočku, hlavně že nonstop spamujete notifikacemi... | Se současnou verzí aplikace mám jeden zásadní problém. Dříve bylo možné zobrazit součet pohybů na účtů za libovolný úsek času. Nyní je to možné pouze za poslední měsíc. Nechápu, proč byla tato užitečná funkce odstraněna. Jinak jsem s aplikací spokojený. ...edit: Děkuji za odpověď. Není mi jasné, proč je tato funkce takhle ""schovaná"", nicméně podstatné je, že stále existuje. | EDITED: Doesn't work on android 14. After one moth of csob claiming they are working on it and replying even to this comment it has been fixed. Not much has changed (now it's not possible to run it even after reinstall). The app works a bit better but is far away from fixed. Still very buggy. Sometimes can't open it. Everytime to open the app you need to login again, notifications don't work. Basically completely unreliable | Non-functional after update. | Proc nejaka treti strana potrebuje sbirat informace o mem telefonu, IP adrese atd? Neni toto samo o sobe security problem? Edit: že chcete být transparentní se sice cení, ale jinak jste mi naprosto neodpověděli na můj dotaz :-( | Po změně otisku v telefonu bylo nutné vymazat data aplikace aby se šlo znovu přihlásit. | Po update appka neustále padá a je úplne nepoužiteľná. Edit: Bohužiaľ, mám Android 14 a vaša aplikácia mi ani po reinštalácii nefunguje. Nikdy som s tým problém nemala, chyba nastala až po poslednom redesigne. Padá a vôbec sa nespustí, alebo ma dokolečka núti prechádzať onboardingom a potom znovu spadne. Blbne vám i Smart key a to už je fakt pekelná kombinácia. Nedostanem sa k svojmu účtu v IB a nemôžem ani potvrdiť platby online. | Updated: After update to 8.6.5 app still does not work - app doesn't launch on first try, usualy on 3rd or more, than I have to always go trought all the confirmation and ""whats new"" pages. Android is with latest updates and so are both apps. Shame that it does not work even after more than a month. (Generic reply with ""good news"" on review that says the app still doen not work is very anoying...) | Google pixel 5 android 14 aplikace nefunkční. Tragedie, blamáž.... Ackoliv se tady chlubite ze je opraveno tak neni. Jednou jde aplikace pustit ale podruhe jiz ne. Asi by nebylo spatne nekdy otestovat pred releasem. | Já už mám pixel 8, kde to funguje... Díky za feedback | App doesn't work on Android 14 and its not communicated anywhere. | One day app just logged me out and now it become the buggiest app ever. It crushes on the start. Sometimes it can run but when I try to log in, I get next error ""Login error unknown error"". I tried to uninstall the app, and clean storage, but nothing helped. | CSOB smart is not working for me since last 5 weeks with android 14 and google pixel4a 5G. Reported to help desk and nothing, just ignoring customers. Really bad experience. | Mel jsem ho rad, ale nova verze je velky krok zpet, nebo spise do slepe ulicky. Neprehledne, zbytecne velke ikony. Napr. V prehledu pohybu na uctu je videt cela jen jedna polozka. 1/4 plochy zabira informace o uctu a zustatku, 1/4 obri ikony, 1/5 obrovske tlacitko payment/platba. Pak na samotny obsah toho co chci videt opravdu nezbyde mnoho prostoru. Tlacitko Kate v dashboardu je opravdu k nicemu, jako cela Kate. Byl vyvojar a tester sjety? Bylo to vubec testovano na mobilech? | Aj napriek vypnutym notifikaciam v aplikacii nadalej dostavam otravne obchodne spravy. Also: neprehladny dashboard, opat preplneny nerelevantnym infom. | Nefunguje na Android 14 - Pixel 4a. | Avoid this bank especially from foreigner perspective. They don't uphold their banking standards. They cater to only Aryans. | Not working at all after update to Android 14! No change since 16.10.2023. My phone is Pixel 4a 5g. Time to go to another bank. This si big disappointment 😞 | refuses to launch with magisk partially installed with no way to skip the ""root"" warning | Lowering my review from 5 to 2 stars because the new interface is absolutely awful. Please, please bring back an option to switch to old one which was clear, no-nonsense and easy to use. Dekuju. *Edit* Thanks for the reply Nikola. Pity that CSOB does not consider user friendliness as part of their offer :( Please at least make the app less cluttered and more intuitive: it looks now like it's designed for a hip 14yo with a fake Gucci bag and tab refilled Evian bottle. Not for adults. | Maintenance on the app stopping it from being used during weekends is not acceptable - like many I only use the app and not via PC - if other none banking apps can handle their maintenance outside of core user times I'm sure as a bank you can also do the same. Profits before people! | Reklama trvale zabírá nejprominentnější místo na obrazovce. | S novou aktualizací a přechodem na Android 14 mi aplikace přestala fungovat na Google Pixel 5. Hlásí neznámou chybu a nic a tím nejde udělat. Smart Key naštěstí stále funguje. | Google Pixel 5. Po přechodu na verzi Androidu 14 aplikace neběží. Jinak jsem neměl s aplikací nejmenší problém. Věřím, se to brzy dáte zase dohromady, ať můžu hodnocení změnit, dosud jste si zasloužili pět hvězdiček 🙂 | Doesn't work with Android 14. Not only this app but also the smart key app. I had to switch to using older device, otherwise I wouldn't be able to use internet banking. I just can't undrestand how can this happen to the biggest bank and after a week it is still not fixed? | After the update cannot login to my account, getting login error : unknown error 😔 Edit: Deleted cache and storage, solves the problem | Po aktuálnom update sa appka zasekáva na splash screene a ostane tam zaseknutá... to naozaj releasujete update-y na tak dôležité aplikácie bez poriadneho testingu..? (Zariadenie Pixel 7 Pro Android verzia 13) | Předchozí verze velmi přehledná. Po poslední aktualizaci v aplikaci nemohu nikde nic najít. Byla totálně změněna architektura a logika aplikace. Nedokážu s aplikací pracovat, musím se vrátit na PC (ale ano, jednoduchou platbu zadat lze, spravovat účet a používat pokročilé funkce ne). Bohužel nás korporát nutí ve jménu ""pokroku"" neustále aktualizovat a vždy se učit znovu a znovu staré aplikace v novém designu. A bohužel v 21. století se bez těchto aplikací obyčejný člověk neobejde. | It would be really beneficial for non czech customers to have ALL items in the App in English. Some are in English, while few menu such as rewards are in czech. | Dizajn domovskej obrazovky sa mi nepaci. Chyba tomu elegancia. Vrchny panel s kruhovymi tlacidlami (tipy) by som uplne zmazal, vobec to tam nepotrebujem, nepasuje to tam. Spodny panel zakryveny okolo tlacidla Kate mi pripomina dizajn Vodafone a nevyzera to dobre. Nevnucujte tu vasu Kate. | Redesign app smisene pocity, UX si pohorsilo, UI jeste vice. Zejm. Homepage, narvat na prvni pozici ""tipy od Kate"" ktere jsou mi uplne k nicemu, bez moznosti je schovat, je fakt plytvani prostorem. Kate vubec nevyuzivam, zkratka proto, ze jsem nenasel scenar, kde by byla prinosem. Vse je rychlejsi naklikat v appce naprimo. Info rychleji vygooglim. To same bottom menu, nejvice promovane a uprostred obrazovky tlacitko Kate. Bylo by fajn pridat moznost Kate plne deaktivovat a skryt ty prvky v UI. | The new interface is cool. But those circles with ads in them are extremely annoying! It would be better to use them for features such as parking and MHD tickets. And put the annoying ads down at the bottom. Pushing those loans so aggressively and forcefully will only push away people. Taking 1 star due to ads. Another star goes away as they're still missing vittual payment cards and other, already standard, features. | Мне очень нравится последнее обновление, интерфейс стал намного удобнее и понятнее | Je vidět posun, ale stáleto chce zapracovat na pár věcech, zejména UX. Dlouhá doba přihlašování oproti jiným bankám, na přehledu účtu jsou informace roztahané a vidět jsou jen 2 max 3 pohyby zároveň, ostatní statické části zabírají cenné místo, o vysouvacím tlačítku Platba radši nemluvit. Všudypřítomná reklama na produkty banky taky moc zážitku nepřidá... | changing to 4 from 5, because the new ""better"" design, is just a mess. can we please go back to that simple and beautiful previous version ? or at least remove the top circles and shortcuts below accounts. what's even the point of having shortcuts in Smart for another application, when I can, and in fact must, open another application in order to use them ? | Aplikace CSOB je hlavni duvod, proc prechazim k jine bance. Pred nekolika lety byvala aplikace rychla, jednoducha a funkcni, od prechodu na ""Smart"" je aplikace cim dal pomalejsi (na midrange 2 roky starem mobilu se nacita cca 20 sekund) a neprehlednejsi (velkou cast hlavni obrazovky zabiraji reklamni navrhy, co si tam hadam protlacilo marketing oddeleni, a tlacitko Kate, ktera me naprosto nezajima). Navic na pozadi jeste bezi nejaky zbytecny antivirus, co jen zpomaluje mobil. Smutne. | Nevyžádané tipy a nabídky zabírají 1/4 screenu... Gratuluji... Další hloupá změna, která aplikaci jenom znepřehledňuje a působí neprofesionálně... Nemohli byste se přestat každou chvíli hrabat ve věcech, které mají být stabilní a fungovat? Vážně nestojím o změnu designu aplikace každých 6 měsíců... | Cool🙃 | Reklamy v horní části obrazovky zabírají moc místa. | Nové UI se povedlo | Na každém rohu to vnucuje nějaké další produkty, které mě nezajímají a ruší při práci s aplikací. Samozřejmě bez jakékoliv možnosti to schovat nebo alespoň zredukovat. Za mě neakceptovatelné a velký palec dolů. | Worst bank ever!!! Run away aa fast as you can!!! | To že je ta aplikace úplně dementní, o tom se vyjadřovat ani nebudu, přehlednost nula. Fakt nasrat už... markeťáky a designéry byste měli propustit! Z nejlepší banking aplikace na trhu před pár lety jste se dostali na dno. Gratuluji | Doufal jsem, ze toho nova aplikace bude umet vice, nez ta stara, ale bohuzel tomu tak neni. Navic neni mozne se ke stare aplikaci vratit. Alespon to minimum funkci co aplikace umi funguje, ale to je snad samozrejmost. | Ach jo... Když už aplikace začala fungovat, dodělali se funkce a přehlednost. Nejaky ... si sednul a aby opodstatnil další vyhozené penize tak se rozhodl UX předělat. Instrukce jsou jasné pokud možno co největší ikony, narvat nahoru úplně zbytečně pruh jako ""novinky"" ""jak zmenit PIN"" a podobne #4&@ co zaberou místo a potrebujete max jednou. Na obrazovce už vidite ještě méně produktů než předtím. Hlavně že z úplně k ničemu ""Kate"" je hlavní tlačítko - že by zase opodstatnění vyhozenych peněz... | Dobrá aplikace, líbí se mi klasifikace transakcí. Jen škoda, že už pod přehledem financí není nějaký přehled pohybů v jednotlivých kategoriích. | Na infolince mě odkázali na tuto aplikaci a ať si zřídím online ČSOB ID. Až na to že to vůbec nefunguje. Založení přes bankovní identitu selže dříve než u Fio stihnu potvrdit druhý faktor. Ok, vyfotím doklady. Selže s nějakým náhodným číslem chyby. | App may be gud, but bank bad | Bravo the staff 0f the bank e.a. | Interestingly perfect | Horrible unintuitive app - for some reason unable to make a single payment... Need another app called Smart key, can someone please explain to me what added security receiving by further clogging my phone with yet another useless app???? What for do I have this one in the first place then??? Have been using UniCredit for several years know and have been more than happy except for the missing dark mode. Will probably be forced to close this account altogether if I can't make even a basic payment. | The app is set in English but Kate writes to me vital messages in czech and it won't allow me to copy the text into Google translate.this is the stupidest thing to do. Yet Kate still writes to me in Czech .... 0 stars if I could | je hezke dostat upozorneni aplikace v 1 hodinu rano na nejaky spam se soutezi... jeste ze to jde v androidu komplet vypnout aplikace si uz neposle nic... | Works ok. | Opět nové oprávnění a žádné vysvětlení! Nač aplikace najednou potřebuje přeuspořádat běžící aplikace? Stává se z ní snad správce úloh?! Již od verze 5.10.6. | Nelze odesílat platby. Při každém potvrzení platby se aplikace odhlásí a napíše ""no cache data"". Opravdu šílený tato banka. Nechápu kdo jim ty aplikace dělá. U žádné jiné aplikace jiné banky nikdy žádný takový problém nenastal. | So far so good. BankID while opening an account worked well with Raiffeisen app, but bugged out with Fio. I definitely logged in properly, I tried three times. Every time, Fio app received the request and let me confirm it, but this app immediately reported an error, didn't wait for the Fio confirmation. | Jednoduché | Do ted naprosta spokojenost a vse fungovalo. Bohuzel v posledni verzi (6.2.3) mi prestala fungovat QR platba, objevi se hlaska: Notice - Unable to get QR code. Nefunguje ani nacteni QR codu z galerie - stejna hlaska. Toto trva i po reinstalaci aplikace. Mam Android 10. Nevim jakou zmenu jste provedli ale za mne krok zpet. | Používal jsem několik aplikací mobilních bankovnictví (Equa, Raifka, Moneta, Revolut) a ČSOB je z nich nejhorší (hodnotím aplikaci, ne služby). Chybí přehled po měsících, po kategoriích. U přehledu plateb je defaultně 90 denní fitr, který se obskurně přenastavuje přes tlačítko hledat (očekával bych infinity scroll s postupným načítáním a možností filtru). Chybí multi-banking (pro banku data zadarmo). Nevím co zobrazuje záložka finance (je tam započitana i kreditka?). ... | Nechápu, proč musí mít tato stupidní banka separátní aplikace na bankovnictví a na potvrzování. Kvůli zbytečné složitosti a nespolehlivosti aplikací jsem přešel k jiné bance, kde jsem naprosto spokojen. | Clovek strati kartu, najde si na CSOB webe oficialny navod ako postupovat, potesi sa, ze by to mohlo byt riesitelne elektronicky, prihlasi sa do Smartu a... Nic. Samozrejme, ze to nefunguje. Ziadnu moznost trvalej blokacie, ako je popisana v navode, v apke nevidim. Ziadat o vydanie novej karty tiez nemozem. Necakat na novu fyzicku kartu a nahrat si ju rovno do mobilu? Sci-fi. V internetovom bankovnictve pri dovodoch pre vymenu karty ani nemate variantu ""Strata"". Nechapem? Cas prejst niekde inde. | 1. Konečně fungují screenshoty. To bylo problémů, že to nejde. Konečně se bezpečnost posunula a nemusím si obrazovky fotit jiným telefonem. 2. Pokud potřebuju aplikaci použít a mám starší verzi, tak mě to bez stáhnutí nové prostě nepustí dál. Neřeknu, kdyby to napsalo, že je nutné pro příště aktualizovat, ale takto bez upozornění je to špatně. Jinak už je to celkem použitelné. | Great | Chtělo by to přehledy o výdajích po kategoriích. A to i pro kreditní kartu :( | No problems so far | Občas je aplikaci nutné restartovat, protože se nejde přihlásit otiskem, dále nefunguje v rámci aplikace objednávání odměn že světa odměn | The app produces lots of annoying notifications promoting their Kate ""assistant"". There is no obvious option to turn them off in the app settings, where I have only ""Important alerts"" activated which I really do no think covers this useless Ad. | Vraj CSOB, a chce to po mne cesky telefon. A moznost pouzit slovensky tam nie je... | Skvělá aplikace, jediné co mi chybí u čekajících plateb je rozdělení celkové částky na dvě či více části. Buď dle měsíců nebo dle četnosti trvalých plateb. Rád bych viděl kolik mi odejde peněz z trvalých plateb do konce měsíce. | Naštěstí se dá v aplikaci nastavit přihlašování přes aplikaci samotnou a Smart Key z toho vynechat. Zrychlení přihlašování o více než 100 %. Při prokliku na profil mě aplikace 2 roky otravuje s aktualizací údajů, které jsem zadal milionkrát, ale prompt nikdy nezmizí. | it's ok | This app is improving and getting easier to use. However, some UI bugs are there. For instance in the dark mode, the amount spent is in a dark blue color in the payment details screen which makes the contrast too low to be able to read the number. | Appka je super, jediný co mi chybí by bylo možnost zobrazit graf (v menu finance) na 90 dní a případně mezi specifickými daty. | super | Superb and user friendly. And thanks for English support | Velký špatný. Mnoho nedostatků a problémů s používáním aplikace a založení nového účtu 😒. | Why do I need another application to be able to login to this application? Why ČSOB smart key? | Aplikace ⅓ času nefunguje a ⅓ času je v ""údržbě"". Čas přejít do banky která není zaseklá v roce 2013 | Good in general. My biggest complain is that i am forced to always have the latest version and if there's an update i cannot do anything. Sometimes i don't have WiFi and must waste mobile data just to be able to check the balance or do a quick transfer. This should be an option. | Po dnesnim update se neda prihlasit | Nepoužitelné. Aplikace neumožňuje ani provést platbu, jak to umí jiné banky. Je nutné zadávat platby pouze přes počítač. V mobilu Vás nutí do nějaké další aplikace, která vždy selže a nakonec skončíte v okně prohlížeče s chybovou hláškou. Na ČSOB je špatně snad úplně vše. Doporučuji přejít k české bance, např. CREDITAS nebi Fio. ČSOB je neschopný belgický paskvil, který neumí ani platby v apce. Digitální pravěk. | Wokrs great but requires a separate app for authentication and lacks some functions and features that web-based banking has. English locale close to excellent. | Přijdu na metro a spěchám. Chci si koupit jízdenku ale zjišťuji, že musím nejprve zadat číslo karty. To je efektivně několikaminutové zdržení. Po této zkušenosti chci napříště zadat číslo karty předem, zjišťuji že to není možné, jde to až u prvního nákupu. K čemu je, že je aplikace od ČSOB, když ani neumí využít moje platební karty, jen ukazuje stav účtu, ale na to mám bankovnictví. | Unable to login frequently. | Ani na nejnovější verzi androidu nejde u karty zmenit limit internetové platby. Limit plateb zmenit jde, ale limit internetové platby se projeví až další den. Neni to problem app, ale politika csob..neuveritelne cekat na zmenu limitu den je silenstvi. App je ok jen pomala vcetne obnovy zobrazeni castek pri prevodech. | Strašný | quite good app for mange Csob products | Awful, slow, misbehaving on taps (seems like it remembered my tap from previous page and applied to new one after it loaded), got stuck in creating CSOB Id after logging in with my other BankId and even after restart can't continue. Very sad...uninstalled | Všechno funguje jak má. | Slayed | Why for the mother of god I cannot add a name to my trusted accounts? Insted of having there contacts I use the most I have to all the time ask them for account number to know if it's theirs.. Revolut has it for more than 5 years why you cannot add this most logic nad convenient feature..? | Děs a hrůza. Jestli vám příjde normální na všechno čekat tisíc let, tak ok, jinak odpad. Změna limitů na kartě je operace na několik hodin, neskutečné. | everything is working fine | I Like the new feature 'Sporici obalky' but unfortunately sometimes there is a huge delay in updating values which is misleading | Ok best | Aplikace je přehledná a umí hodně věcí, prakticky už nezapínám bankovnictví na pc. Jedná věc ale není dotažená: Karty se nezobrazují tak, jak ve skutečnosti vypadají (jsou jen barevně rozlišené), což při větším počtu karet dělá orientaci mezi nimi dost složitou. Přitom Google wallet i Garmin pay zobrazují tyto karty se skutečnou grafikou. EDIT: Karty do Google Wallet se fotit nemusí. Grafika se také načítá z nějakého systému. | Terrible internet banking. Most of of my payments don't go through. | Odflaknuta aplikace - proces vytvareni ID uprostred zniceho nic chcipnul, navic aplikace obsahuje nepochopitelne chyby (2x vyfotte predni stranu obcanky - misto ""predni a zadni""). Tohle snad delali amateri, normalni QA by to vychytalo... | App is refusing to work for months, telling me it's because my phone is rooted - even though it's not!!! | Otřesná aplikace, každou chvíli nesmysl aktualizace a obvykle nefunkční, když ji člověk zrovna potřebuje. | Irritating assistant ""kate"" that sends me notifications i never asked for and cannot be turned off. | no customization | Hrozne me irituje, ze jiz nejakou dobu nemohu kopirovat text z informaci o kreditni karte (hlavne pole current balance). V minulosti to bylo mozne a dost to usnadnovalo repayment. | 🤔 Aplikace nerozpozna QR kód z galerie. Filtrování transakci je nepřehledné, nejde hledat platbu podle popisu nebo názvu příjemce. A hlavně není možné nastavit vypnutí automatické konverze na platební kartě ‼️‼️‼️ to může stát docela dost peněz navíc. Prosím podívejte se ke konkurenci | Dobrý den, Aplikace bez aktualizace nejde spustit, jak si vůbec můžete dovolit u bankovní aplikace zamezit uživateli přístup? Musí stale fungovat i stará verze neka kazdý ma v každé tísňove situaci možnost začít aktualizovat app Tohle by se stát nemělo | Po updatu aplikace, ktery byl vynuceny ze strany csob ( puvodni stara verze prestala fungovat) aplikace nejde spustit, respektive nejde se mi do ni prihlasit pres smart klic .... toto povazuji za velmi fatalni , toto by se nemelo stavat. U tak velke banky bych cekala ze se vyvaruje takovychto zasadnich chyb ktere komplikuji uzivatwlum zivot a pripravuji je o cas ... 😥 | Chcete něco rychle v nedávno aktuální aplikaci a jste doslova donuceni k další aktualizaci. To se nesmí stávat | Bola pridaná možnosť upraviť trvalé platby a boli pridané notifikácie o pohyboch na účte. To boli jediné dve veci ktoré mi chýbali. 5* | -* za to že nejde vypnout reklamní banner na produkty ČSOB | Dělá to co má, ale chtěl bych si vypnout reklamu v aplikaci na půjčky.

So we can't use it | Hartstikke goed | Action store we love you Many years good quality and service in the city's Thank you. Best wishes. | No english language only dutch | Really poor UI and UX. It is like a school student developed this app as a project. | Ik wil de gamma app installeren, waarom krijg ik dit? Tis al een slecht ongeorganiseerde winkel met goedkope spullen, ik hoef datzelfde niet op mijn telefoon... | Julie alen de speullen die die wij willen heben weg very sad... | No option for English, not sure why considering the amount of English speaking people trying to use it | Good products overall but whay I always have to click on ""load more"" when scrolling down ( should follow the principle of ""Minimal Clicks"" ) | Despite of many immigrants in the Netherlands this application doesn't have option to change the language to English. | Love this place🤩 | Good products at excellent prices | I hate apps like this where you don't have options to change to English...not everyone in Germany speak German etc... | Great 😃👍 | IAM a action girl❤️❤️ | Verie diffecylt game | Werkt niet goed meer. Nieuwe artikelen kunnen niet meer bekeken worden. Ajb fixen🤗 | The kids that work there are mean and jealous. And to young. Costumer Service is AWFUL | The app is not available in English!! | Honestly, compared to the other store apps I have, this app is really good. The customer qr code loads quickly, and even increases your screen brightness so it can be scanned more easily. There is a function to scan products in-store. It's way faster than other apps from other stores. I'm honestly pleasantly surprised by the ui. | Good App | So good for shopping 🛍 And not that expensive 😁🎧 | Goed,zo | Mirelle eeft mij gehackt | Super appli qui permet de voir le montant de ce qu'on met dans nos favoris (ce qui n'est pas le cas de tous les magasins) on peut donc se permettre de mettre plus facilement des articles pas cher pour se faire plaisir sans avoir a tout calculer après et décider si on veut ou non acheter ces articles en plus. Voir les nouveautés de manière claire permet aussi de penser à passer faire ses emplettes ! 😎 J'adore cette application | Sell dangerous products to work with food. When notifying them about this you get an automatic response where I doubt the issue has been read by any human. Please do not buy product that will come in contact with your food from them! | The articles you see are are very sparce and the ones you can order are mostly things you don't really use...they should offer all store articles for delivery...annoying 😤 | Fully buggy and damn slow.. No images of products coming.. Very slow.. No english lang present.. Uninstalled immediately | No option to change language to English. | Very good app it just needs an option to create different favorite list. Ex: I want to buy an item today and some I want to save them for later, at the moment there is no option to separate them like other shopping apps, they're all in one favorite list | Oké | Logt steeds uit | No English language | You can't even log in, created a brand new account and can't even log in with that one... | EXCELLENT 👍👍👍👍👍 | The app is buggy, when you want to check different categories or the week deals it gives errors and nothing loads. | Dutch only | App works, unable to create and use account. Continuously timeouts on the server. | It would be great now to also order within app. | Thank you - now much easier to use and understand. Thank you for your quick solution to the problem. Original texte - Language choice. Downloaded and then un-installed. App only available in Dutch and Spanish with no option for other languages. | Goed | Works fine for me, but damn this takes up 500mb, seems a bit excessive? | Fijn dat je kunt zoeken of de action (misschien) iets in het assortiment heeft, alleen voor de online shop wordt je nog steeds naar de website doorgestuurd. En nog iets: het is zondag vandaag, en als ik een action winkel zoek, toont de app de openingstijden van woensdag. | Push notificaties oprotten ermee | Not able to login after creating an account. Tried forgot password... Same problems... Hence removed | I thought I can shopping through this app. Better uninstall. Bye bye👋 | Why is s this not showing in English? | Fijne app en ziet er mooi uit. Je navigeert heel makkelijk naar de gezochte producten in het menu, en via de zoekfunctie kun je eenvoudig het product vinden wat je zoekt. Ook handig om een lijstje te maken van wat ik nodig ga hebben bij een winkelbezoek. Ik vind het een fijne app. | Voor verbetering vatbaar. | Ik kan niet inloggen. Ik krijg altijd de error ""Voer een geldig e-mailadres in"" | Awesome | Kansloze app. Je kan Geen winkelvoorraad checken. De action website is ook bagger. | Cannot make account ,cannot login, cannot see anything. Constantly get the message that something went wrong .. | From beginning its so stupid for ask all that questions.. to put all that info ..weak up stupid porgramer ..you dont need to ask all this questions . Keep it short and simple its just poor shop .we are not asking for nationality or passport from city house ( from net site is more simple and easy ) .... one star is too much for you on android ..👎... Delete | It would be great if I could do shopping from the app, not just seeing! | Rubbish app. Couldn't log-in, even after 3 days, I kept getting the message my account was being set up. | Tot de laatste update was deze app een echt geschenk, maar nu opent hij niet meer en geeft hij alleen nog maar foutmeldingen. Erg jammer want was fijn met het winkelen! | Good | Gebrek aan kwaliteit. Ik kwam een maand geleden bij de action om oordopjes te kopen. Tot mijn verbazing deden deze het niet. Ik kreeg ook geen bonnetje. Ik besloot het de dag erna weer te proberen en kocht andere. Ik besloot ook om zelf te vragen voor de bon. Hierop het antwoord:nee. Deze oordopjes werkte weer niet. Een maand later besloot ik knutsel spullen voor mijn kinderen te kopen. Papier, stiften, en markers. De stiften waren uitgedroogd en de markers waren leeg. | Op zich een fijne app en het maken van een lijstje is handig. Alleen erg jammer wanneer je de app opent op een nieuwe telefoon en inlogt, je lijstje helemaal leeg is en je dus alles weer zelf moet toevoegen. | er moet een vertaaloptie zijn naar het Engels of een andere taal. rust is erg goed. | verlanglijst inladen duurt te lang, enkele minuten. iets verwijderen lukt niet. open je een artikel om daarna weer terug te gaan naar de verlanglijst, duurt het weer enkele minuten. ongeacht hoeveel erop staat. | Superapp! Lekker afstrepen op t lijstje. Zouden jullie wel mijn favoriete winkel onthouden?! Enn ook iets van drukte aangeven in de winkel, stond gister dikke rij in de regen | Lees wat zuurpruimen over deze app maar moet eerlijk zeggen dat ik het zelf echt een hele fijne app vindt! Overzichtelijker en sneller dan de website en scannen in combi met handig boodschappenlijstje werkt super in de winkel! Tuurlijk, er kan nog wat verbeterd worden, zou bijv zo fijn zijn als jullie voorraad tonen zodat ik weet naar welke winkel ik moet gaan en ik vind het nog wel lastig om snel iets toe te voegen aan mijn lijstje als ik in de winkel ben. Hopelijk kunnen jullie hier iets mee! | Nice app | Geweldig | Click en collect niet mogelijk en inloggen op de website ook niet waardoor je lijstje niet gesynchroniseerd wordt. | Mooi zou zijn als de click&collect hier in kon. Valt nog veel te verbeteren. Bij vergroten van foto zou mooi zijn als je ook links en recht kon swipen om de overige foto's gezien.

"Microsoft Authenticator","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication
Multi factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless
Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill
Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts
Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.

Optional Access permissions: 
Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq
Accessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.
Location: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.
Camera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.
Read the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue.","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill.

I would be able to access my account if it wasn't for your trash app. Well the only positive thing out of this is at least my email account can't get hacked because you have locked the account. Cheers dorks | Easy to use and very practical | Great when trying acct recovery and saving passwords. Easy pop up instructions | Works great. Excellent for another level of security. Never had a problem with it. | This app is trash and should be ash of itself not able to work my school account lock and I get a huge middle finger to face saying we can't help Microsoft truly a trash place | Work we'll, a little annoying to have to use often. | It was easy | Ok | Good app | I can't sign in into it and i can't proceed to part of putting the 2 numbers they gave me | Works well | Difficult getting notifications since I changed my phone. It's not working with any of my current devices. Frustrating | Amazing | Good so far. | It's fine | This app always saves the day for me because I'm just so forgetful. | Tha nks for giving super simple and ad-free app. | Good App | I used to use authenticator normally on my previous phone for my work account. I changed my phone recently and set up the app. Everything seemed fine except for the fact that I didn't receive the approval notifications at all. I tried a lot of fixes, including reinstalling the app and setting up backups, but nothing really worked. I thought maybe the system gave priority to my previous phone or something like that and tried to uninstall the app on my previous phone.

Worked perfect before my phone updated | So easy to use | Got a new phone, now the app doesn't want to work. Can't put in the 2 digit code anywhere. Can't access my work emails, etc. Pathetic app. | Great | Good 👍 | Very good, to avoid hackers to hack your account | Does what it says on the tin. | Works great!!!! | Great | Great! | That went better than expected. | Works well in the Microsoft ecosystem | It works seamlessly | Works well for me. | Very poor app, it's difficult to enter authentication code in pop up windows.

Do wish the app looked at the full URL, not just the domain, which makes having multiple password on a single domain impossible | Great app. Easily approve access to your work and personal accounts. | Very reliable - for now :-) | MS 2FA one of the two factor authentication apps I use. Everyone should be using additional authentication these days! Never put your all your eggs in one basket. Reduced star because of issues supporting other individuals over time.

Nemožnost placení via Google Playz se kteroi jsem bojoval, vyřešena data resetem aplikace. | Best app for public transport in czech | Idiotic adds..... | Aplikace funguje dobře, ale dark pattern na tahání souhlasu se sdilenim marketingových dat je extrémně otravná. Pokud jednou uživatel řekne, že nemá zájem, je snaha donutit k rezignaci, potažmo čekání, až se někdy ve spěchu uklikne, dost toxická | Works perfect. | Currently, this app does not allow more than one search before having to restart it. When attempting the second search, the app gets stuck on the loading circle. Very frustrating. | Po updatu musím potvrzovat platbu i 22kc v internetovém bankovnictví. | It is a good app, everything works as it should. Good work | I came to Czechia a few weeks ago.I feel like this is the best and smartest transportation app in the world | Redesign navigationbaru je půl bídy (beru jako postupy proces), ale tlačítko koupit (kosik s cenou) jízdenku ve vyhledávání, je tedy dost nevzhledně pozicovan | Perfect. | EDIT: Idos stále těží z někdejšího Babišova monopolu. A co se Vašich reklam a cookies týče, zaplatil jsem za zrušení reklamy. Přesto v nastavení nadále vidím zhruba 200 serverů, se kterými potenciálně sdílím data. Polovina z nich nejde zcela zakázat... Je těžké věřit Vašemu tvrzení o tom, že tyto nejsou využívány, když se s každou aktualizací volby mění. Nepůsobí to transparentně ani důvěryhodně... | Awesome | Appka má velice nepřesné odjezdy | Comportable | It's good. | Užitečné | Well put together, accurate | Aplikace neustále šikanuje a vyžaduje potvrzení nucenych pseudolegálních špehovacích cookies. Pokud si dám tu práci a odškrtám, že všechny nechci, ještě ten den se vše resetuje a opět obtěžuje. Tento postup je nelegální!! Koukejte to upravit a stáhněte to tak jak to má být! Zaveďte možnost ""Odmítnout vše""!!! Nejsme žádní vaši otroci ke sledování!!! :((((((( | Jednoduché, přehledné a rychlé. Akorát bych přidal možnost uživatelům informovat o spojich (neco na styl ankety; napr. jestli ma spozdeni...). | Discovered a bug - when buying a ticket, selecting the ""Junior 18-25"" age category and enabling the ""certificate of study"" discount to the ticket doesn't actually discount the final price of the ticket | Very good. I like the ability to buy tickets. Information is very accurate. | EDIT: Přečetl jsem, nic se nezměnilo. Co dál? ""Rozhodně vám nedoporučujeme se při příchodu na stanici/zastávku řídit informacemi o zpoždění, protože se mohou tyto informace změnit. Vždy byste se meli řídit časem odjezdu dle jízdního řádu."" ... To vaše posouvání o minutu, když uvádíte zpoždění mě začíná pěkně štvát. Stále včas, včas. Pak tvrdíte, ze je autobus už na zastávce a pak přidáváte minuty. Tahle informace je k ničemu. Buď se na to vykašlete nebo to upravte. Tohle je na nic... | Easy to navigate, find routes and make payments to purchase train tickets. | Useful and accurate info. 👍 | Edit: jak si mohu zakoupit nezobrazování reklam a dotazu, aniž bych nejprve dal souhlas, resp. aniž bych nejprve odklikal tisíce jednotlivých položek? | Velmi užitečná appka | Aj keď si zrušite všetky súhlasy, či ""oprávnené nároky"" v nastaveniach, tak aplikacia ich všetky zresetuje... | Aplikace nyní obsahuje dialog, kde si můžete vybrat zda souhlasíte se sběrem všech vašich informací, nebo souhlasíte se sběrem všech vašich informací s extra kroky. Soukromí se můžete pokusit ochránit manuálním odklikáváním desítek (možná stovek) inviduálních tlačítek ""Legitimate interest"" v schovaném menu. Tohleto hraničí s legálností. Naštěstí již existují alternativy, které nabízí příjemnějši soukromí. | Právě mi to prodalo 2 stejné jízdenky na jeden vlak! Uz jsem objevil chybu. Sice jsem nenastavil 2 osoby, ale program si celkem neprakticky pomatuje, ze jsem naposled kupoval pro 2 osoby a nechal to tam. | Aplikace nově vyžaduje schválení cookies cca stovce různých dodavatelů s ""oprávněným zájmem"", není možné jednoduše odmítnout vše a když už si člověk dá práci s tím všechno odklikat, za pár dní musí dělat to stejné... Velký palec dolů | Od doby co přidali možnost podívat se na zpoždění v předešlých dnech, (což je úplně zbytečná funkce protože s váma vlak milerád vyjebe tím že výjimečně přijede na čas), tak aplikace dost často nezobrazuje kolej na kterou vlak přijede. Jako člověk který pravidelně jezdi jednim nebo dvouma spojema, které jezdi ve stejný čas, jsem používal apku hlavne jen kvuli tomuto. Teď musim jak důchodce čumět na tabuli, protože to nějakej blb nemůže zadat do aplikace. | it's really good for navigating it includes trains buses trams and trolleybuses | Amazing transportation throughout Czechia and accurate bus/tram timings on the app | ""Oprávněný"" zájem nelze vypnout najednou. Po vypnutí se Předvolby dat po čase zase zobrazí. | Excellent traveller's tool. | Tahle aplikace je skvělá, je tam vidět všechno co člověk potřebuje vědět o spojích, ale žádné blbosti navíc. Co mě ale zklamalo je design kupování jízdenek, respektive místenek. Protože když omylem přehlédnete možnost zakoupit místenku která je tam napsaná malým písmenem tak se vás to ani nezeptá jestli si ji nechcete dokoupit. Příště si už musím dát pozor. | Zpoždění autobusů je úplně náhodné, aplikace mi třeba píše zpoždění 8 minut, ale autobus přijede na čas. Zrušené nebo přesměrováné spoje jsou v aplikaci stále vedené beze změny, dnes jsem čekal přes dvacet minut na autobus, jen abych se dozvěděl, že je spoj přesměrován, v aplikaci o tomto přesměrování nebyla jediná informace. Bída a bolest. | Skvělá aplikace, jenom na jízdenky co už neplatí bych ocenil oddělenou sekci od platných. | Free | Very complicated ,make it easy ,so can make sense out of it | Very good app to find bus, train and tram connections. But yet to improve with the train platforms accurately. | I found that application is good 👍 | Simple and powerful ! Very intuitive and responsive, payment with Google pay is a super easy and the function to share to calendar is awesome :) Thank you for this great app | To nové zvětšené písmo je příšerné. Při vší úctě opravdu naprosto příšerné. | Often lacking backwards compatibility, you need to update the app in order to search any connections at all. Doesn't show obvious train connections, you gotta look up the trains yourself and use this app to travel only to the train stop. Every single time I use the app, it asks me for consent, pretty annoying if you're trying to decline most of it. | So you want money fir public transport info ... and you bug me with a language i do not undersrand and you do not have reject all non essenziale coockies... no thankyou. Bulkshit I got a popup if I want to upgrade to a version without adds. | No simple ""Reject All"" button on personal data request and the app keeps re-requesting it periodically after rejection. Response from creator confirms that this hostile design is on purpose and lies about not being able to show ads otherwise, while not commenting on how needlessly complicated it is to withhold consent. | Fungovalo to docela dlouho akorát teď tam nepíšou vlakový spoje třeba tam vynechají celej spoj že v aplikaci není ale na googlu to je. Řekl bych že aplikace bude fungovat stejně ale nefunguje doufám že to opravíte děkuju | Purposedly shows the GDPR consent form repeatedly (at most inconvenient times, of course) if you dont agree to everything. Booo | I've already paid for add-free subscription. And still app pushes the advertisement. | Hello, while it is a good app  For God's sake, how do I change ""my location"" radius? When start stop is on my location there is +-20m and no possibility of change, so this feature is TOTALLY useless when you want to find a stop that isn't really near you. I would expect that changing this would obvious working... Besides this fail, good app. | Always charging automatically for more people than one. I just paid a ticket for 2 instead just for myself. I am done with this app. | Nedaří se mně koupit si nezobrazování reklam. Transakce je vždy zamítnuta Googlem. Pokud se to brzy nevyřeší, koupím si licenci CG Transitu na další rok. | Vracím hvězdičky po opravách chyb ve spojích (chyběla celá jedna linka o svâtcích), které byly, jak se nakonec ukázalo, způsobeny chybou v datech na straně poskytovatele. Škoda jen, že si to nemohou vyříkat společnosti mezi sebou, když na to u jedné z nich upozorním a musím to řešit sám, když chci, aby se to opravilo. | The app works OK, when it works. Especially when phone is switching different data connections (mobile data, wifi hotspots on stations) the app stops working properly, the payment process hangs, and I'm unable to buy a ticket. Several times I had to pay cash with extra fee (because its not possible to buy an e-ticket after train departure time). | Really useful for finding the best connection to get somewhere. Also lets you know live if your bus or tram is running late. | Very Helpful | The best app for public transport in the Czech Republic 😊 Great app. | Not that clear | Convenient, easy and does it's job. | Great app, delay information, train ticket purchase | Exactly just enough of what I need in my day to day commute, ads are not invasive, interface is easy to use, alarms and reminders work as intended, nothing to complain about | Moje nejoblíbenější aplikace na cestování po ČR. Sem tam se mi lokace nechce updatovat, když to nejvíce potřebuji, ale jinak jsem velmi spokojený. | Opravte, jak se zobrazují reklamy. Na každém androidovém telefonu co jsem zatím měl se mi aplikace sekala jako prase jakmile se tam zobrazila nějaká reklama s animací, GIFem apod. A druhá věc, ukázání nejbližší zastávky podle lokace je sice super věc, ale ocenil bych kdyby se počítání času než se na nejbližší zastávku dostanu dal vypnout. Není nikdy přesný a musím si tak vždy načíst dřívější spoje. | the most misleading app of all apps affiliated to Prague's transportation schedule, and Mr. Developer is questioning my understanding, even tho it's his job to fix that misleading application when your firm pays me to do your job, I'll specify issues and apply testing, come with output and work on it. cheers. | its amazing sometimes glitches but i just love i use it everyday. love it | Good | Really usefull for travel across Europe with detailed information of platform, timing, mode of transport, price and many more. One bucket list app for Europe travel | Great when it works. My problem with this app is that it confidently displays wrong information and presents it as correct (which is, at least for me, worse than admitting that it doesn't know). Some examples: 1. The bus/train ""delay times"" show on time, even though the bus/train didn't even leave the first station yet, and will be clearly delayed. 2. The bus departure time is wrong by 5 minutes, but still shows ""on time"" and that the bus is in a completely different station than it really is. | OtBuuy | Appka byla super, ale teď není schopna zapamatovat si mé cookies předvolby a na Android 13 se neaktualizují notifikace s časy odjezdu, takže jsou k ničemu | 14-09-22: Včera instalováno, v nastavení jsou data aktuální, JÍZDNÍ ŘÁDY NEJSOU AKTUÁLNÍ, ukazuje spoje, které podle PID nejedou(jedou jindy), např. dnes, Florenc->Háje IDOS(20:27,30,33,36,39,45), PID(20:30,36,42,48) Podle PID metro skutečně jelo. NEPOUŽITELNÉ | V aplikaci mi chybi nekolik zastavek a spoju v mem meste, kdybych se nekoukl na stranky idos tak vubec nevim, ze nejaky takovy spoj existuje | Veřejná doprava je díky tomuhle strašně lehká. Úžasná appka | Funkčně skvělá aplikace. Jediná věc, která chybí k pěti hvězdám - přestaňte se mě každý týden ptát na souhlas se zpracováním údajů/cookies, protože vám nedávám souhlas. | Прекрасное и удобно приложение для приезжих в страну и незнающих языка это вообще находка. | It's great app I like it it's showing sometimes it's showing wrong hour but again it's a great app. | Užitečné. | Amazing!!! | Kde je tlacitko zdileni? | Everything is really great, except it doesn't show when a train is cancelled. S1 was cancelled yesterday and again today. It is bad luck and I only have to wait 30 minutes, but if I would have known I could have taken a different route. Now I'm 30 minutes waiting on Masarycka. | easy-to-use.I have been using it since I moved to Czech Republic 2011. | Issue remains: can't buy tickets, error | The application is great and easy to use, when it works. Oftentimes I am accused by the application of not having internet access, despite being connected to WiFi or having my mobile data turned on. Sometimes, it resolves itself after a few tries, however most of the time I have to restart my phone in order to fix the issue, which is rather inconvenient, especially when I need to find a connection quickly. | verim ze na dlouho posledni edit: aplikace po dvou dnech zacala zase bez problemu fungovat. diky moc technicke podpore za okamzitou snahu pomoct s problemem | Really helpful app, makes traveling so easy. We could look up the times of trams, buses and trains locally and could plan journeys further afield. | Excellent work at day and with metro and trams. But, specific at night time, don't show buses. Only trams | Použijte pubtran nebo můj vlak, idos nevyhledá všechny spoje. Tohle je aplikace z éry idos monopolu. | Like the ""delayed"" reports. ; ) | To si delate srandu, v roce 2022 to nenajde moji pozici ale zobrazi trasu linky 🙈 | Best app to search for public transport | Fine, practical app, easy to use. Only annoying thing is that when I select one of my previous searches it automatically finds the parameters from before. I don't need to know the schedule for yesterday's tram. I want to use the connection for now or select a new time. Can you fix this please so it just fills the form with the station names for right now and won't search right away so you can set the time as you need it? Thank you | Very good | dobra aplikace je spolehliva a urcite se hodi | Awesome. I don't need to find it on the internet. B it would be better if it showed if it's late, I need to go to google to find out. But great app anyway! | Dávám odinstalovat, jsou jiné a mnohem lepší appky, které mě nenechají na holičkách, když pospíchám a rychle si potřebuji ověřit spojení, na dávání consentu každé 3 vteřiny fakt nemám chuť ani čas. | This app is fantastic and minimalistic: it helps you navigate around the city and does it straightforwardly. | Když neudělím souhlas se zpracováním nepotřebných údajů, začne opakovaně vyskakovat dotaz pomalu při každém druhém hledání a je potřeba odkliknout asi deset položek, které nechci! Otravné!!! Odinstalováno! | Time table is irrelevant. Please sync. | .. edit: 5 stars for quick customer support. | Pokud nechcete svolit personalizované reklamy, musíte ve všech položkách odbouchat, nezájem. A po týdnu nebo 14 dnech znovu a znovu a znovu dokud nepodlehnete. Jinak aplikace funguje jak má, ale tohle je otravný. | No clue why did they remove my review, although whenever I scroll across an ad, the app's refresh rate drops to Less then 1fps. I got pretty high tier mobile device hence I doubt it's a user issue. Would appreciate a feedback. | Excellent and easy to navigate | Čas od času používám a vždy dobře posloužila. | Fantastic! | Couldn't function without it here in CZ | Used to be good, but now wants you to consent with cookies every time you use the app, if you didn't consent to everything the first time. At this point, I think the PID lítačka app is a much better alternative | This app is really useful until it's wrong. There is no way to report a train error. | Funguje jak ma, nikdy zadny problem. Ocenuju i moznost videt jak moc je spoj zpozdeny. | Za cookies... edit: vím k čemu cookies slouží a také myslím, že se od 1.1. změnilo to, jak mi je máte nabízet a jak já s nimu mohu souhlasit/nesouhlasit a nejsem si uplně jist, jestli to je ve vaší aplikaci správně. Strávil jsem minimálně pět minut odmítáním oprávněných zájmu. Kdo mi ten čas vrátí? | Nejde spustit na android 12 Galaxy S10+ | Na Xiaomi 8T aplikace nefunguje. Nejde aplikace spustit. | Just installed it on Galaxy S21 with Android 12 and the application is constantly crashing and not usable at all :( On my old phone with old Android version was working OK... | Was very useful, keeps crashing immediately upon opening, app is unusable in this state. | Don't show nightbus | Good धेरैं राम्राे छ | To automatický nastavování startu a cíle mě neskutečně vytáčí. Předpřipravím si, kam pojedu - za 10 minut jsem u startu a najednou tam mám náhodnej cíl a musím to nastavovat znova, i když jsem aplikaci ani nezavřel. Vývojáři s tím prý nehodlají nic dělat. | Nenajde stanici Husinecká, i když ji sama nabizi Nejlepsi appka na dopravu, hlavnem prazskou MHD, pozna, ze jedete do prace nebo domu a nabidne moznosti, Super, lepsi naz PubTran po reinkarnaci | Very useful | I am OK with advertisement in app but why would I need to accept Consents every 7th time I use search it's beyond me (I have accept the terms...). Lately there seems to be a bug in search where if you search transport from 19:00 it shows one in 19 something and next in 21 something but if you change the start time to 20:00 it will find one that leaves at 20 something. This shouldn't happen. I am highly disappointed as this was pretty good app but it's going only down hill... | It's idiotic I just need to know the schedule, why all this hoopla? | Sometimes the system doesn't find a connection people normally use and rather says there's none or offers some very inconvenient one. With increasing number of delays it becomes harder to read times of departures. Also the developers do not like constructive feedback. Still a pretty good job though. | 1 stars due to constant Consent Management, it doesn't save your preferences and forces you to manually go through a loooong list whilst maliciously coloring the buttons to `Accept Your Choices` and `Accept All`.👎👎👎 Started using a FOSS scraper instead. | Very good | Nejde naráz odmítnout souhlas s reklamou jednoduše. Není zde tlačítko ""odmítnout vše"" zároveň je vše ""opravněný zájem"" a vše je předzaškrtnuto že souhlasím, což je nezákonné a to hned u několika stovek reklamních systémů. Takže hnus. K odpovědi: Ano, ty zákony znám, reklamní systémy nepatří do oprávněného zájmu. Aplikaci hold mažu a jdu používat PubTran, co vypadá, že nešpehuje a nepřeposílá data co nemá. | Does the job, worth the paid version with no adds. | některé zastávky lze dohledat pouze přes mapu nikoliv přes vyhledávání :( | Proč si nemůžu stáhnout tu samou PDF jízdenku co mi přijde na e-mail. Proč ten QR kód co se zobrazí v aplikaci po chvíli zmizí. | Not gonna give you the rights! Disgusting and uninstall | Cookies a reklamy | Google pay service is ""temporarily"" unavailable since june, using app is useless right now. Edit: it was fault of my browser, not the app. | hruza!!naco vubec provozujete aplikaci ktera lze o stavu spoje? spoj ktery ani nedorazil do vychozi stanice a ma zpozdeni 20min, hlasite ze je na trase! konkretne R887!.... odpoved; k cemu ta app teda je?hodnota dat 0 v porovnani s papirovym jizdnim radem a tohle v main features je tedy proc: • Online search = always actual data including delays and disruptions?????? odpoved: od kdy jsou v jizdnim radu zpozdeni? | Nepoužitelné. Schválně lže o časech vlaků. | Ty vaše otravné reklamy totálně zasekávají telefon a vyhledávání spojů. Když nejsou na obrazovce, vše v poho. | Totally useful. Great app, thanks to it i was able to find connections and buy all the bus and tain tickets during my travels. | The application has stopped working. It does not show connectionc, but those that show are complete nonsense!

So I hope I described clearly. | The screen layout could be more compact. | Please update visa payment on Xiaomi S1 active ,and replace Alexa with Google assist , they both don't work on our region. | This app is great for my new watch the most calories ive burned are 893 calories | App looks really good but its effectiveness is limited by its tendency to stop syncing with the watch on a regular basis. | Great app tells me everything I want to know | Good app | Bring back the lady that tells me how many km I've made,it's useful to keep track. Also for international use, why is there no option to use the date in a European format? | No more apps just 3 app I can install, need more app to install in my watch like calculator and more, I can't use my watch to pay in my region for brand S1 | No way to change to imperial units for workouts. | I'd read lots of negative reviews about this app but I've actually found it to be really good. Transfer of data from Zepp Life was straight forward (although did take a while). Tracking and display of data is very good and in many ways an improvement over Zepp Life. No issues with connectivity that some have had. | Its totally amazing app.i like this | Good. | One of the weakest fitness app I've ever used. Can get rid of the service announcement at the home screen. Cards on home screen are not rearrangeable, it can be just turned on and off. Cant turn off 1 km notifications in workout. Vitailty score doesn't work. 2 weeks I'm wearing Amazfit and Redmi Watch, Zepp app shows 105 PAI, this shows vitailty 1. After 11km bike ride Zepp added 23 PAI points, Mi fitness 0 Vitailty points. Maybe it watch's fault... Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro | nice | This is the best app for doing workouts, it even motivated me to go cycling at 6 AM.Thank you xiaomi | Interesting stats | Sync issues | Zepp life was better | Very nice | Good | 🤮 | Very good and accurate app. | Nice apps it's really help a lot 👍 | Enjoying sleep and jogging feedback but would want more easily accessible guidance to fully utilize more functionality. | Love the app, very easy to use and useful to find out important info about my health | Easy to use. Love that the UI is so clean. | This app is so nice | while I scan QR Code. it say not supported. why? | Very good app to control watches | Recently it keep asking me to enter mi account password. Even after entering the password it keeps on asking. Very irritating | All good except the bold fonts hide away other normal fonts when displaying the running summary. | Good design, but needs to have more dynamic analysis of health aprametets. | Great!! | 👍👍 | Good apps to track my workout,, monitor how much calorie burn.. unfortunately sometimes the apps disconnected from the mi band.. | Great apps,easy to use and get around. 5 stars | Awesome I was able to know my daily health status. | Serious notification problem. Cannot have notifications on my smartwatch (Xiaomi Watch 2). Prompts me to turn on app notifications every time i open the app. And every time i choose custom notifications, it goes back to sync all notifications. Which they dont work... | Best | Add calculator and more app | Please provide a full global firmware update in order to have full English description with Other Region syn not only China | Best | Easy to use. No complaints. | In app steps showing 5437 and in Xiaomi watch s1 active showing 4529 and kcal in app 518 and in watch 509 even after updated not fixed so what Xiaomi management doing there?????? | It's a really useful and helpful app | Lack of stability | Great | How to export reports in any other format than picture? | Ytut | Good | Perfect. Fits my requirements. | I haven't had any issues. Syncs well. No paywalls. Good features. Easy to use. | Good, but with a minus: Google Fit integration doesn't count intensity. App should sync with Google health connect not Google fit. | i take it every where i go | Easy and convenient. | Great app overall! Just wish messenger calls could also be answered. | Not accurate, differs when syncs with strava | Awesome app!! | accurate | V good | Amazing | Why does de ""discoverable"" function didn't appear in mi band 8? Also the app stops showing the ""band display"" now i can't change my diaplays :// | Good GPS positioning. Able to detect heart rate well. | Loosing connection, less options than the old one. | good this is awesome | I can't connect to my account on my samsung phone. Whatever I press in the app I get the white screen! | This app is great | Love the app, just wish it could link up to other apps that track calories etc, like my fitnesspal, then I would get much more accurate health data to accompany the sleep and exercise data | We want Google Fit data sync for China region! | It doesnt work with mi band 5 but works for mi band 4? | Good!!! | Good | Fix the sync issues asap. | It is not updating sleeping data from my band. One night it does, the next just skip and won't transfer, even manually. It is frustrating. Update: I rased from one to three stars because it works well with the watch ( but mot with the band). | No accuracy and stability | good just wish I could install different apps on my watch | So many options as compared to other same level competetors | Can't measure blood pressure | Without this app, i cant use my watch, but based on the reviews i might have to give it a 4 instead of a 5. | 👍 | Simple and powerful | excellent | Good Application | Good overall, but would like to see more band displays | Love it. Good app. | Es linda pero no funciona bien con la mi band 6 por ejemplo en un día que la estuve usando tuve problemas con la vinculación e hice un registro de actividad y no coincidía los datos de la band con la app me puso pasos de más en todo el día no tiene buena vinculación entre la mi band 6 y la app | The problem is the blood pleasure,how to put in my watch | I love the app | Good | nice | It doesn't show notifications on how many steps taken, and that's quite poor, this app should be able to remind one to complete their step target for each day but it doesn't do that. They should try to make their notification functional /active, the app is just dull. It doesn't have any form of motivation, you won't even remember it's in your phone. | Fantastic App. | Simple to use. Does what it says on the tin, to quote someone else. | I start use this app. It's new for me right now | Pouzdano | How about blood pressure check! | best app | Amazing amazing features | Great app I have ever used and very accurate | Worst map ever | What that app aa tu | Very good | Cannot connect my xiaomi phone to mi watch. Pls repair | Mi 5 not showing in this app. I cant pair my device. | When comparing exercises it seems the chart will only compare minutes of exercise. Pointless. Give us more comparisons for running between the different sessions to see progress. | it is hard to pair S1 watch, poor app | Nice | Excellent | Stoped receiving data from mi Band 6 and doesn't sync anymore | Very comfortable | کیری بود | not connecting with device after update | You will love the details | Fix google fit integration please. Step count doesn't sync and other problems with google fit. Add integration with Health Connect too. | Useful but too advanced for my economy model smart watch#3 hence distance measurement is wobbly n inaccurate due to smart watch's minimal GPS subs. But still enduring n exercising towards getting a more advanced smartwatch.... | ऐप्लिकेशन इस not सपोर्टिंग | Good | Comprehensive information | 21.3.2024 07:24 , Novi Sad, Serbia (local time) problem with synchronisation. Today temperature 0/18 degC on the watch (0 at the moment) but on the phone is 8 degC which is more realistic. | Mediocre GUI, terrible graph 📉 design. And get any worse with each update. Slaggish sync. Very limited devices support. | Give some motivation and give so useful motivation not like other apps | I cant change online watch face | всё работает только на ми бенд 8 не показывает погоду | it's really good | This app is the best💛 | App needs to support health connect or Google Fit export properly. Steps and heart rate are not synced correctly with Fit or any other application. | I constantly have to reset and scan my xiaomi smart band 7. I wish it would just stay connected. I have activated unlimited data and unrestricted battery to keep the app running but my smart band 7 disappears after a few minutes. Frustrating. | band does not vibrate during running activity on every kilometer... please do something | Still learning. | Perfect | It's a excellent fitness app | Wonderful","{""1"":56143,""2"":22849,""3"":36504,""4"":130838,""5"":484182}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co.,Ltd","Beijing+Xiaomi+Mobile+Software+Co.,Ltd","miot-xiaomiwear@xiaomi.com",,,"https://watch.iot.mi.com/html/privacy/index.html?locale=en_US&type=watch_privacy_policy&model=app#/","Beijing+Xiaomi+Mobile+Software+Co.,Ltd","Health & Fitness","HEALTH_AND_FITNESS","[{""name"":""Health & Fitness"",""id"":""HEALTH_AND_FITNESS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ckdy8xrXTjq9F9haFIiV-CNMAdRgGQlPGl6KJ2s38hDH3cXHKUPvXCRrGvjOt3UgbA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q96YSqAczGPovPgYrBeVr8B4smtzxLgWBCtRz1NXeR7j3pVkTWl5-ZltxkDjwkEs7vyV","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wTJN87AyUFNBPEU5ScNQP_bpzTlIHKc9b8RomUgIT3Y3UcVPThYdTQG4QQGUUuQZxPdh"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qpsbjNC3AH1FLAwXZ2bE6nVaIwhmyUHFK-e9NtsHoZqrWl6lOhmYqMSzvEEllo-umb8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hjPCrf71P068uPmd2RUmH0AbSNxOzHS8VpXJUmxOIrJNwU2Y9nK1Rc6MO3nGj76BzUA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JkUuP_vk-BD4uR53G6qcrVsIa7bIxOEgr5c9K-JbEUMOLkixp19EBZ-6xEmZ2zVRWP0""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jun 28, 2020",1710330742000,"3.27.0i"," Fix some bugs","[""Hello, as a perfectionist with some OCD I really dislike visually new update.

But the level of ignoring customers DMs, seems unbelievable. | My food is always missing. | nearly free beer on wolt market every week | A lot of issues with the deliveries, deliveries constantly get delayed, sometimes even for over an hour, or missing parts of the order, never once do I get a compensation. Customer service is non responsive. The delivery people always want me to get out of the house and meet them iout in the street (I live in the ground floor).

I saw a driver walking to my house with two bottles of drinks as ordered but when i met him he gave me only 1, i tried raising awareness but i guess giving credits and telling the costumer to shut up is easier than actually dealing with the problem.

I was too weak to go anywhere or do anything. Wolt, kind of, kept me alive with their quality products and their quick delivery. Thank you, Wolt 🙏🏾 | EVERYTHING IS DELIVERED PERFECT!!! | The best | the best application of delivery | 100%👌 | My courier is late for 15 mins. Moreover, My Cola cup is almost empty, my floor is dirty because leaking Cola cup, and my food is cold. Don't recommend it at all!!! | Amazing 🤩 | fast and proffesional.

Defenitally 5 star from me | When I saw that the dish it the restaurant cost almost 50% less than in Wolt my mind was blown up (22 lari in the restaurant and 40 lari in Wolt!!!). I've never seen such an crazy hidden fee (I thought that it was the actual restaurant price). Unbelievable!!! | Bad bad bad. Was a customer for the longest time but with the recent drop in quality of service and the totally useless customer support I've decided to delete my account and never use this garbage app again. | חייבים להרגע עם הפרסומות popup תוך כדי שימוש באפליקציה, אם פתחתי את האפליקציה אני כנראה הולך להזמין... לא צריך פרסומת כל 15 שניות | Wolt Delivery has been such a good convenience. I appreciate having this delivery service here in Tbilisi. | Prices are sky high. Smaller portions and higher prices than in a restaurant. In addition to that you pay delivery fee and service fee. Then you get cold food which looks nothing like in the pictures. False advertising. | Pregledno in funkcionalno. Trudijo se izboljšat uporabnikovo izkušnjo. Top | Great customer service that somehow always responds instantly? Friendly couriers, short delivery times, affordable prices. Wolt has it all! | I can't order anything below 25 GEL. I don't understand why I can't order exactly as much as I need?! | Disappointed experience | It's ok and the deliveri comes very fast! | Good app But make sure delivery time stays accurate by requiring restaurants to indicate accurate order completion times. | Convienient | The app asks me to login. When I choose to login my Gmail it prompts me to enter my number. When I enter my number it says ""this phone number is already in use""..... so then how do I login??? | 👍🏻 very nice | Charging a lot Some restorants are a really rubbish | ההתראה של התחפושות קופצת כל רגע | Amazing service, professional staff!

If you need a refund, you can easily ask for it. Deliveries are very easy and fun to order. There's an Easter egg game and I just love this app! | Tons of hidden fees, ETA for delivery changes midway without notice, missing items are replaced without asking. Basically a way to pay more and get less. | I like it | No delivery in my town. | Offers ""free delivery"" but the sign up process doesn't actually work so you can't order.

I ordered one meal that was stone cold, not even slightly warm I complained to customer services and was basically told I was lying, with no support or refund offered in anyway Bare in mind I placed hundreds of orders with Wolt, very rarely complained, the response and attitude from wolf was simply disgusting I will never use them again and I hope others see this before ordering | Perfect | Good service you can find what you need | Great first time experience. Easy to use and on time. | To put it shortly: horrible experinece. The support did not help me even a bit. Food came very cold previous 5 times I ordered, tried to give them a chance a lot but there was no point they could not right their wrongs. As long as they fit in their given estimate time wich shouldn't even be an estimate (in my opinion if you don't know the delivery time dont give them 10/15 minute difference estimates) they do this to get of the hook when you are not satisfied with the only job they have to do | I ordered a delivery. Courier called and ask to pick up order outside (well no problem). After that I was waiting for 30 minutes calling him 12 times trying to explain where I am including sending him location. He kept on saying 2 minutes... Eventually I had to apply the support. Surprisingly, they said to me that the order was damaged and they refund me the amount within 14 days. I sent the screenshots of about 12 calls but they disregarded this. Terrible! | Professionalism, great support team, and user-friendly application. | 2η φορα που κάνω παραγγελία και περιμενω και δεν την πήρε ποτε και εβγαλε ""βαλτε διεύθυνση"" ενω ειχα μπει κανονικα. | Wolt delivery is very quick. | It's the first time i used Wolt and i love it so much | Har inte beställt så många gånger men det är snabbt enkelt och i tid, inte sällan i god tid! Riktigt bra utbud! | Aplikaciju vec dva mjeseca steka pracenje kurira. Zadnji put je dostavljac jadan cekao 10min pred adreso. Jer je meni pokazivalo da nije niti pokupio narudzbu. | Please add the ability to comment on any item (a dish) in an order from restaurants. I have allergies and this feature will help me buy more dishes without certain ingredients. | Drivers dont read instructions and leave the food at the doorstep of the building on the street.. and customer service is not responsive, send generic messages and don't provide any assistance. I paid for an order that was never delivered. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. | Great app easy to use | Don't use this app. If someone gives you the wrong order, the customer service will not give you your money back. They will scam you. Try something else. Absolute scammers and criminals. Hopefully they will go bankrupt. Let's hoep so. Lots of better apps than this one. | Too often lately I'm getting the notorious ""restaurant is busier than we thought"" message from this otherwise excellent app | Wolt is the most rediculous low quality service company I know. | Amazing app very easy to use | Wolt simply the best! | Ostatnie zamówienia bardzo mnie zawiodły. Jedzenie przychodziło po długim czasie oczekiwania zimne i często zalane przez napój, który się wylał. Ostatnim razem kurier nie mógł znaleźć klatki (stojąc przed nią), pokręcił się wokół bloku, zaznaczył, że zamówienie dostarczone i odjechał, a tym razem stał pod blokiem i w końcu wyszłam przed blok i sama musiałam go znaleźć. Zaznaczę, że dostawcy innych aplikacji nigdy nie mieli takiego problemu. | By far the best | Odlično 👌 | Sorry - very disappointed in how the orders are handled. You got a promise on that an order will be delivered in 15 minutes and then it takes for over 2 hours when the promise of 15 gets extended over an over. It seems Wolt is not a vendor you can trust. If you want to have a meal in time just trust your order with alternatives... | Super Buggy app! Had issues right from signup to placing order. The customer support is not any helpful either. Certainly a big 'No' unless you wanna waste your time | I can't login with my accurate credentials, prefer to use other apps then this buggy piece of 💩 | Food | Худший сервис и для заказов, и для работы. Никогда не отвечают, вовремя не привозят, денег не возвращают. Зовут на работу и полгода рассматривают договор.

Paid 4k huf for a slice of bread. Upon contacting the support, we get a message that we try to improve next time. But we all know the next time never comes !! Not gona use it anymore!! Better to use other alternatives! | Good.. | Please tell your couriers to bring change when delivering our orders please even when I type exactly how much I have they still have nothing | Always delay the delivery and do not refund you. Be aware! Scammy! | Very good service | Great service | They charge the service fee for goods which I returned because the store sent the wrong product . Which means I paid for the mistake of the store. | Should be an option to split payment in order together | Used to be good, now you get your delivery X 3 of the originally presented time | Nice | Az elmúlt 1 hónapban szinte mindig dupla idő alatt szállítanak, mint a becslés, néha még ennél is tovább tart. A support pedig mindig ugyanazt a sablon üzenetet küldi 🥲 | Eddig bármilyen szolgáltatót használtam, ha az ingyenes próbaidőszakot lemondtam, akkor a promóció idejéig használhattam az extra szolgáltatásokat. Még volt 2 hetem az egy hónapos Wolt+ próbaidőszakból, de amikor lemondtam oda is lett. Sehol máshol nem tapasztaltam még ilyet, le is töröltem egyből az appot. Ennél azért több engedmény járna szerintem. | Food arrives late despite high delivery prices. It says up to 60 minutes but food arrive after 86 minutes. The dishes in delivery have poor quantity of food and is cold. Customer service not compensating for delivery nor food. App is deleted. | Vrlo bezobrazno, postavljen limit da je potreban narudžba iznad 12 eura ili Vam cijenu podignu na 12 eura bez obzira naručite li ispod te cijene. Katastrofa. | Good experience. If there are any issues they are swiftly resolved. 99.99% of the time there are no issues. Couriers on this app seem more professional than om competitors apps. | Delivery time is excellent. | Δεύτερη φορά μου κάνετε μαλακια.2η φορά είναι ότι απόψε έκανα παραγγελία και σας το τόνισα δύο φορές να κρατάτε το pos και το προσωπικό σας με παίρνει τηλέφωνο αφού έχει περάσει η μισή ώρα ότι δε διαθέτετε Pos .τι φάση πραγματικά?Το παιδί δε φταίει σε τπτ.@@@@@@@ | Great service | This is a great application for ordering food. And i'm very satisfied with how easy it is to use | Sose jó az érkezési számláló, az embert hülyének nézik ezzel, még a support is a késéseknek a reklamációját mellőzi és próbálja szép köntösbe öltöztetni, hogy nem is úgy van | estimated time. will order again through wolt. | You should add penalties for drivers that break the law and puts us all in danger and specifically one way | They have a vey good services and offers which is affecting very well on the customers satisfaction. 😊💙 | Najbrzi! | its feels like they realy wants me to enjoy my orders & their service, with my little experienc if you want to get what u paid for - only wolt!!! | Fljótlegt og þægilegt fyrir staði sem aha er eru ekki með eins og til dæmis KFC og Taco Bell, ég prufaði Wolt einu sinni í Danmörku og var bara núna að prufa það hérna heima og ég get sagt ég eindregið mæli með Wolt, ég mæli með að tippa sendlunum eitthvað smá fyrir að vera kurteis og faglegir með sendinguna þína, þeir eru frekar snöggir með sendinguna líka 🙂. | Always here when needed... | Works well, I am satisfied. | Horrible service | Amazing Good | Donesi je bio zakon. | Bad chat support, delivery time estimate, and service quality. | Ძაან კაია გენაცვალეეე😘❤ | Sovellus on erinomainen ja toimii hyvin | Good service, amazing timing 😄 | Сделайте бота как у BOLT, чтобы очевидные проблемы решались быстрее и автоматически | Wolt gave me the worst experience yesterday. I waited 90 minutes for food to hear from the delivery boy that he's cancelling my order, he will not be coming. Please, close your business or hire someone who knows how to use google maps. I still can not believe it. I hope my 15 euros will make you richer and grow your business. | 90% of the time the food either arrives cold, or something is missing. Most restaurants don't really care about the food quality either, because they know Wolt will compensate the client. | everything was good thanks 👍 | Exceptional thanks | Always great service | Supr. 🔥🔥🔥 | Perfection | Very nice delivery options in Georgia | Brzo jednostavno, full! | Ļoti ērti 😉🤙 | კარგია | Quick and efficient service. Plenty of choice | Great for ordering from a wide variety of restaurants | They really don't care about keeping loyal clients. I was paying for wolt Plus, and they had a promotion for 5 months free. I went to the customer service asking or they would give to me and they said no, it was just for new customers 🤡 I am a sole mother of two autistic kids recently divorced and trying my best to save money. And I used wolt to buy things from wolt market. So I just deleted the account, and now I buy from Bolt instead. No consideration for loyal customers. You lost me. | Waited 2 hours for delivery but order wasn't even sent to restaurant. Horrible. | Κάποτε, είχε τρομερό service και τρομερή υποστήριξη. Τώρα κάθε παραγγελία είναι και μια απογοήτευση. Καθυστερήσεις στις παραδόσεις, δεν βρίσκεις κάποιον εύκολα στο support και όταν γίνεται λάθος ούτε έκπτωση, ούτε κουπόνι. Δεν βρίσκω κάποιο λόγο να το χρησιμοποιώ πλέον. | Impossible to register. I never used the app. Tried 2 different emails. Magic link is just a link to open a new account which ends with ""error"" message | The best | One hour of waiting for courier to be assigned for the order, when the dish is already ready! This is the ""service"" Wolt provides in Hungary!! I am constantly complaining on that during two last years. And, of course, they are doing nothing with that! | Customer service time is appalling and the chat AI is ridiculously bad. The app is quite buggy overall. | Принесли еду ужасного качества. Поддержка ничем не помогла. Больше ничего через Вас не буду заказывать | Used to be good, now they are absolute garbage. Delivery times went from 25-35 min to usually an hour+ And when you contact them. A person with the mind of a bot will tell you that your delivery was on time and we hope you enjoy it. Cold food, mindless staff and they are yet the most expensive (for same food from same restaurants) absolute scam.

I'd have an easier time actually rooting the phone and hiding the root from this stupid app. EDIT: Please, stop bullshitting. PSD2 does NOT mandate consumer device scanning in any way.

Nepochopitelné. | Good | Does not work on rooted phones, using the excuse of ""regulations"". However, applications of other Czech banks work perfectly on rooted phones. | Nepochopil jsem, proč musím mít další aplikaci sloužící jen pro ověřování mých akcí jako je přihlášení do internetového bankovnictví či potvrzení odchozí platby, atd 🤦‍♂️. Ostatní banky, jmenovitě Air bank či Fio, mají vše zabudované v jedné aplikaci mobilního bankovnictví a je to tedy značně pohodlnější.

Nedoporučuji a varuji před tímto nebezpečným sledovacím softwarem. | Works (so far). Utterly lacking in security, even though you are forced to use it. You can choose to login with biometrics, which is laughably easy to misuse by a malicious party gaining possession of your phone, or a five(!) digit PIN. Five digits exactly, mind you, you can't even pick something longer and thus at least marginally more secure. The idea that all someone needs to steal my money is either a finger, or a simple five digit code is frankly terrifying. | Terrible product, really! Go back to Brussels! Hlavatý , | I will never use this app, please implement it into mobile banking in some nice way (e.g as AB has it), untill then I will pay with cards from other banks. Too low rating for banking app. Edit: should I consider CSOB Smart to be security risk just because it offers aroud 20 features which I do not want?

Ale i na SGS9 je to neuvěřitelně líná aplikace, což pro pouhé push notifikace a potvrzení akce nechápu. | Minimalistická. Funguje bezchybně. Oceňuji, že je oddělená od aplikace pro Smart Banking, kterou tak není nutné instalovat, pokud člověk mobilní bankovnictví nevyužívá a chce jen komfortně potvrzovat platby kartou a přihlášení a transakce z internetového bankovnictví. | just works as expected. reliability is the most important for such app | Haven't had any problems so far | Simply works | Aplikace je svižnější, než bývalá, i když stále otevření stálé chvíli trvá. Pět hvězd by si zasloužila, pokud by bylo možné potvrzovat z notifikace přes hodinky. | Urychluje přihlášení i platby 🙂 | Fixed problem with ""rooted device"" by uninstalling ""offending"" applications (IDK why this app dares to scan the phone for any applications. Is that not a violation of GDPR?). Approving works. But, after last transacion approval, it asked me whether I like the app - I don't hate it, but I answered No and then it wanted me to tell why, which just redirected me to choose from a set of messaging apps - this is confusing, because I can choose WhatsApp (or such), which I guess you don't have. Shame | Super, quick and safe service | Stopped working, complaining that my device is rooted, which is NOT. | Tvl, to si z lidi snad delaj srandu, co je to za silenou aktivaci, a proc neni jedna appka na vsechno, jako to maj normalni banky?!?

Please, improve it. | It works perfect! | Vůbec nefunguje na Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite (tablet), zatímco na jiných zařízeních funguje. Aplikace při přihlášení, po požadavku na potvrzení (zadání pinu) přesměruje na nějakou www ČSOB namísto toho, aby fungovala standardně jako například na Samsung Galaxy S21 FE.

I wish you had sent a notification. Disaster. | ""On break due to maintenance"" is horrible thing to see when you are trying to complete a purchase of items that are quick to sell out. Maybe including some notification that there is going to be a scheduled maintenance and when? | To je zase výmysl, jak mi zrušit přístup k mým financím, aniž bych mohla že zahraničí něco ovlivnit. Hlavně, že kvůli téhle aplikaci mám stále české číslo, abych si mohla potvrdit transakce, teď už to neplatí a protože tahle aplikace selhala s první aktivací, teď nemám možnost jak se dostat ke svým prostředkům. Nemůžu najít kartu, takže si musím místo toho požádat o vydání nové karty. Určitě nedoporučuji, pokud jste v zahraničí a potřebujete podporu. | It says ""Activation failed"" and ""Check the connection"" when attempting to activate. Tried factory reset, activation through ATM and Internet Banking options, still the same result. | This app crashes very frequnelty. Please fix! | couldn't open this app for 4 days straight | No je opravdu výbornej nápad mít 2 aplikace, při vstupu do čsob smart musim zadávat pin do druhý aplikace, která je jenom na psaní pinu? Trvale odcházím od čsob k jiný bance, páč tady nic nefunguje, ani lidi ani software, čus | negunguje. trvalo to 30 minut a nefunguje to | doesn't work | great | How can a provider switch off payment request approval for like 4-5 hrs?? CSOB promissed this app would be better than the former sms code approval, but Smart Key simply isn't. It's not even close and I don't want it. Why doesn't it have any history of approved reques?

Celý telefon jsem měl zkopírovaný z původního a nastavený za zlomek času, co mi zabralo nainstalovat a spustit tyto dvě ČSOB aplikace. Musel jsem je obě 2x přeinstalovat než to vůbec začalo fungovat.

Immediately when I try to approve any kind of a request I get an error, that my request expired. I can't pay via card online. The only possibilty on the internet is good old money transfer, which I must do with 'offline authorisation' only. Helpdesks advice was typical 'Have you try to reinstall it?' Yes I have, didn't help. My phone (realme) has Android (not some modification or anything) and should be compatible. | Podařilo se mi to zprovoznit a beztak se to v některý den rozhodne nefungovat, s příštím obnovením ať po nás chtějí abychom házeli kostkou, zda budeme moci něco koupit v internetu. | Absolutni fail ze vsech ceskych bank, hodne stesti kdyz se vam to uz jednou podari nahodou zprovoznit a pak se vam rozbije mobil | Aplikace jen v angličtině a po ukončení absolutně nepřehledné. Nechápu, proč ČSOB nemůže mít jen jednu chytrou aplikaci, jako to mají jiné banky, se kterou může klient pohodlně sledovat jak pohyby na svém kontu, tak s ní i potvrzovat platební transakce. Smart Key funguje jen pro potrzení indentity klienta, v ostatních sekcích tohoto appu se zobrazují jen černá pole. Vícestranou funkčnost bohužel postrádám. | Zapnout to je fakt bolest | Terrible application | Awful user experience trying to sign in | Great | Totaly useless. Been throu second time and couldnt get it into working! Stoopid. Im deff going to change the bank tommorow! | Po posledni aktualizaci aplikace pada, po reinstalovani chce povoleni z internet banking, prihlaseni vyzaduje potvrzeni v smart klic. Smart vyzaduje povoleni z internet bankingu. Zlaty potvrzovani sms klicem | Proč potřebuji tohle a není to ve smartbankingu? Máte vyloženě 9 aplikací a každá dělá to stejné, ale zároveň jinak. Doporučil bych vyvíjet jen JEDNU aplikaci ať si my, zákazníci, nemusíme stahovat takové šílené množství zbyečných aplikací...(Smartbanking je v nejlepším stavu, i když tam chybí mnoho věcí, jako jsou jednoduché push notifikace při transakcích, takže toho bych se držel a postupně vyvíjel) | The app is working fine but notifications are displayed too late...even after I have already confirmed the transaction. | Aplikácia padá, nedá sa spustiť. Pred pár týždňami fungovalo všetko normálne. Nemôžem potvrdzovať platby, najhoršia aplikácia medzi bankami | Aplikace se rozbila po aktualizaci, jediný způsob jak znovu nastavit smartklíč a zrušit starý je přes zavolání do banky nebo cesta na bankomat/pobočku. Příšerný systém v době kdy každá 2fA služba má způsob jak v takové situaci zrušit aktuální zabezpečení. Jak se může vůbec stát že projde aktualizace co zablokuje tolika lidem přístup k internetovému bankovnictví. No katastrofa. | Otisk nefunguje spolehlivě. Přihlášení do telefonu misto pin funguje skvěle, ale v aplikaci otisk nefunguje. (Přihlášení trvá dlouho.. cca na potřetí vezme otisk) | Při potvrzení se objeví ""potvrzování"" aplikace spadne a platba neproběhne | Proč chce aplikace SU oprávnění, zvlášť když je podle ní root zařízení tak nebezpečný? | Dobrá, jednoduchá aplikace | Poprvé jsem potřeboval použít offline generování kódu a ani jednou mi jej to nevygenerovalo, aplikace se zasekne. K čemu něco, co neumí ani tak elementární funkce? Proč je aplikace tak těžkopádná a proč není integrovaná ve Smartbankingu? Vážně přemýšlím o přechodu k jiné bance čistě z důvodu uživatelského komfortu. | It keeps rejecting my payment. Retarded system compared to the SMS system they used to have. | Unable to pair it with app or internet banking without personal visit of ATM or local bank. Of course unable to log into internet banking without smart key... Very anoying loop... | MUCH more secure, than SMS and you never have to enter your bank credentials to pair this app. As someone with some experience with information security, I say ""get it"". | Už asi 5. pokus nainstalovat a po „stažení” píše chybu že musím zkusit aplikaci nainstalovat znova.. | Aplikace na nekolika zarizenich hlasi, ze je offline a aktivaci nelze provest, prestoze wifi funguje, jak ma... | Aplikace nefunguje, a to i přesto, že mám Android 8. Jen se zobrazí logo ČSOB a poté celý mobil zamrzne. Díky nynější povinnosti tuto aplikaci používat je pro mě teď nemožné platit na internetu. | This app should be part of the mobile banking app. Why are there two? The map based feature for finding atms is obsolete - other very basic apps do it better. Please don't add features just because you can. I rly feel like this app is just wasting my mobile phone space 😕 | Fast, secure and convenient. | Why do we need two apps! It's utter rubbish. | Why does this app request root access every 10 seconds ❓❓❓ | Quick and easy to use. | Works as expected, no hiccups. | very easy to use and secure | Appka docela v pohodě, ale nechápu proč to není integrované do jedné aplikace (smart banking) jako to má třeba Airbank. | why is this separate app to smart banking? poor design laggy and another useless aplication that should be included in main app | Keeps crashing when settings tab is opened! Peace of junk! | Aplikace padá. Aktivovala jsem, založila, spadla. Volala do ČSOB, obnovila jsem znovu klíč, zase spadla. Můžete mi poradit co s tím? Nebudu pořád obnovovat klíč, každou hodinu? Kdy bude nějaký fix? :( | Aplikace úplně k hovnu.. Mohlo být součástí normálního smartbankingu jako to má třeba airbank. Navíc když jsem si potřeboval změnit heslo... musel jsem přejít zpět na smsky neboť s touhle kravinou to nešlo. | Hooray! Finally I can confirm the card payments on the internet without hassle with sms 💪 | 120MB aplikace na potvrzování SMS kódů. 🙄 Prosím, dělejte s tím něco. | It worked well in the beginning. But soon an update came. To update I had to remove some other applications, but SKey still needed 48 mb for update. I had only 36 mb, so could not get to my bank account, now I have to change Smart Key for better way of operating my account. Very bad experience. | Prečo je potrebná ďalšia aplikácia a nie je možné potvrdzovať prostredníctvom hlavnej smartbanking aplikácie? K čomu to je, keď na zmenu limitu v IB mi na potvrdenie dôjde SMS? | Pouze 5 mistni PIN beru jako velkou nevyhodu, vzhledem k faktu ze vetsina aplikaci vyzaduje bud 4 nebo 6 mistni PIN | Lepší než SMS, ale nechápu proč to musí být jiná aplikace než co už mám pro bankovnictví. Další věc je že čekám na nějakou notifikaci, upozornění když dělám platbu ale ono ho..o. Musite aplikaci otevrit aby se vůbec něco objevilo. Přihlášení do webového bankovnictví to stejné... Překlady obecně v ČSOB dělá někdo na koleně nebo za trest možná Google translate by bylo lepší a přesnější... | Nefunguje, nemožné použiť na prihlásenie sa. Na aktiváciu treba prihlásenie do IB, ale na prihlásenie do IB treba kľúč, demo verzia nefunguje, vypisuje správy o platbách v roku, keď som ani nemala účet a podobne. | Ta aktualizace je nezvladnuta. Dneska jsem nebyl schopen zaplatit jidlo u otesanek,eu, i kdyz jsem platbu pres smaratklic zdarne provedl. System u GoPay hlasil, ze transakce neprobehla... Zakaznik je totalne znejisten, kde je chyba, aktualizace klice, nebo GoPay vypadl, co bude priste.... Ne kazdy zakaznik ma cas na takoveto ""sluzby"". :-( | Not good | Donedávna funkční s potvrzením otiskem. Najednou chce jakýsi pin, který neznám. Takže znova aktivovat do bankomatu nebo na pobočku. A manuálně smazat data, protože UI to neumí. Jediná app, co děla takové zhovadilosti ve jménu ""bezpečnosti"". Příklad InfoSec hysterie. Mam sakra heslo, tohle je jen druhý faktor! Nejaký SMS fallback taky nic, co? Banka, kdy se jen kvůli aktualizace nedostanu do IB je výsměh! Ještě že mám root a obnova ze šifrované zálohy pomohla. Užijte si davy volání na podporu !! | Člověk musí mít extra aplikaci a ta po update nefunguje, chce to PIN kvůli nějaké migraci, ale po zadání to napíše, že error. Takže do bankovnictví se nedostanu, paráda. Přitom u Airbank, kde mám druhý účet, mi stačí jedna aplikace a nikdy se nestalo, že by nefungovala. | Qr code engine je rozbitej, dík že se nemůžu přihlásit | Po aktualizaci nefunguje. Takže se kvůli tomu nedostanu do internetového bankovnictví. Celkem na prd. Ale u ČSOB aplikací žádná novinka. Bohužel. edit jako odpověď na odpověď: dobre vedet, ze si muzu Smart Klíč znovu aktivovat v ban(K)omatu ČSOB. Akorat jsou vase instrukce trochu nejasne (nemusi se nejdriv smartklic deaktivovat? v IB, kam se momentalne nedostanu? Smart klíč se mi totiž jen načítá, načítá, ale před načtením appka crashne. takže ani nevím, jak bych v bankomatu novou aktivaci provedl. kazdopadne mi to pripomina dodgy a nečekané aktualizace za časů plateb aplikací NaNákupy... člověk vyrazil bez fyzických karet, a při placení mobilem na benzínce zjistil, že NaNákupy prošlo aktualizací a před dalším použitím je nutné stavit se u bankomatu čsob a provést opětovnou aktualizaci.... | Po updatu stale pada. U aplikaci CSOB celkem bezne. Nejen ze musite mit 3 aplikace misto jedne, nabic ani poradne nefunguji. U jine banky jsem takovehle diletantstvi fakt nezazil. EDIT: Hledat nekde bankomat kvuli reaktivaci zmrsene a v podstate zbytecne aplikace kterou vam banka v podstate vnuti, to je fakt super... Ani nepocitam kolikaty problem s nekterou z aplikaci CSOB to je... S touhle bankou koncim. Jinde mi staci jedna apka a funguje bez problemu a nemusim porad neco resit. | Never works, always crashes. | nedoporucuji. system funguje jak ma. ale nakonec to budete pouzivat jen na prihlaseni. stejne budete radsi psat sms. a pak jeste kdyby jste nahodou se dostali do situace, kde vam ukradli penezenku(s doklady) a mobil a mate novy mobil. tak SE NEDOSTANETE DO SMARTBANKINGU,PROTOZE SMARTKEY JE JEDINA MOZNOST JAK SE TAM DOSTAT! A SMARTKEY SI MUZETE UDELAT JEN PRES SMARBANKING ALE TAM SE NEDOSTANETE PROTOZE POTREBUJETE KOD A K TOMU NEMATE DOKLADY A K TOMU JE VIKEND. Budete se citit hrozne. nedoporucuji | why you don't use Google Authenticator? | Aplikace je jen k jedne veci - pro prihlasovani do bankovnictvi a veci 
okolo bankovnictvi. Vyvojari ale opomenuli fakt, ze pro potvrzeni 
internetovych plateb chodi taky potvrzovaci kody a musite opisovat 
nesmyslne dlouhe a slozite kody ze sms. Takze resi veci opet jen na pul. | Naprosto famozni! Zvlast po posledni aktualizaci. Skvela prace. Tohle mi strasne chybi u konkurence. Opisovat SMS kody je desna otrava.   Pouziva to hw-backed storage, takze zaloha /data oddilu nestaci. Nicmene aktivace pres bankomat je bezproblemova a rychla! Hodne dobre vymysleno.  EDIT: diky za podporu otisku  Dalsi kroky: pouziti aplikace v 3dsecure (platby kartou). | Quick, easy and working | Tankyou | Great app | Geniální. Po upgradu se mi aplikace deaktivovala a jelikož se teď nepřihlásím o internetového bankovnictví, můžu běžet na pobočku nebo do bankomatu (s kreditkou, ze které nevybírám)... | 1. Pozadavek na pin se neshoduje s pozadavky pro generovani pinu v bance. Nemuzu pouzit stejny pin, jakym se hlasim do bankovnictvi.  2. Nelze nastavit jazyk nezavisle na prostredi.  3. Nelze autentifikovat pomoci otisku prstu. | Pěkná aplikace, ale má několik chyb: 1. Nelze nijak pohodlně obnovit klíč, když třeba smažete data k aplikaci. Vzhledem k tomu, že mi stále stačí SMS k tomu, abych se dostal do mobilního Smartbankingu, nevidím důvod, proč by to nešlo obnovit pomocí SMS.  2. Naprosto chybí nastavení, především jazyka. Na anglickém systému z toho vyleze ošklivá míchanice jazyků. Ne, nebudu měnit jazyk telefonu, tohle patří ke standardním funkcím aplikací.  3. Na Androidu 7.1.2 není dostupná nová verze. | Chybí možnost změny jazyka...podobne jako u na nákupy... Docela elementární věc, ale stále s tím problémy :/ Ad odpověď: ano, to jsem pochopil. A to je snad důvod, aby to nebylo uživatelsky měnítelné? Telefon stejně jako PC používám v En, ale u aplikace české banky, kde celou dobu vše mám v češtině bych uvítal toto. | Po přešlapu zrušením několika funkcí webu přechodem na nové ""moderní"" stránky, pozitivní krok.

Takže nemocný a silně infekční člověk (pominu že by měl být v izolaci) je tečkou/čtečkou neodhalitelný a klidně po jejím zkontrolování může do restaurací a jinam mezi lidi... | Nefunkční nlze se přihlásit furt jen otevírá další webové stránky | Ještě 2 dny mám nařízenou izolaci kvůli pozitivnímu testu (před 12 dny). Přesto aplikace ukazuje zelený (platný) certifikát o prodělání, který je validní i po načtení čtečkou. | Edit: Díky za reakci, přidávám hvězdu. Ale opravdu myslím jazyk aplikace, nikoliv certifikace. Aplikace používá jazyk telefonu a nelze to změnit. Můžete prosím umožnit uživatelům zvolit jazyk aplikace? Tato možnost tu není a v žádném případě nehodlám měnit jazyk telefonu kvůli ignoranci vývojářů. | Showing certificate as invalid even it is valid. App is useless (as developer confirmed in reply). | Proč není možné změnit jazyk aplikace? | Po updatu nezobrazuje do kolikateho a od kolikateho je certifikat platny a ani nejsou na vyber vsechny clenske zeme EU (Presne ted myslim Dansko ale chybi jich vice). Jinac dela co ma. | Totální sracka vládo polib si prdel | Opravdu skvělá aplikace, gratuluji vývojářům | Zeme ze kterych se ockovani uznava nejsou kontrolovane (alespon ke dni 29/11) - z nejakeho duvodu zmizelo Svedsko (jako cast EU by skoro jiste v seznamu byt melo) a pribylo Togo (jako jedina africka zeme v seznamu). Vypada to ze kdyz nekdo zadaval do seznamu zeme odkud se ockovani uznava, tak vybral ze scrollbaru proste spatne, a nikomu to vubec nevadi, protoze se aplikace nejspis ani netestuje. Pro me (ockovaneho ve svedsku) to ale znamena ze muj certifikat se tvari jako neplatny! Vrcholny amaterismus a totalni QA nedostatek. | Aplikace zatím funguje skvěle :) | nejde změnit jazyk, musím měnit jazyk systému (android) | Odebírám hvězdu, nevím zda za to může aplikace, ale testy u dětí se nahrají (pokud vůbec, u jednoho dítěte se nenahralo do teď) se spozdenim 24 hodin oproti výsledkům z laboratoře. Úplně likvidujete jakoukoliv kredibilitu opatření a ministerstva zdravotnictví. Z prvníma verzema se to dalo pochopit, ale teď je třeba to s tím technickým týmem začít řešit. Není to technická hračka, ovlivňuje to životy!!!! Pokud to nechápou, je třeba najít někoho kdo tomu rozumí. | EDIT: menim hodnoceni, protoze i po systemem rozpoznane a evidovane nakaze mi to porad ukazuje, ze jsem bezinfekcni. Takze u lidi, kteri to neresi (a je jich bohuzel mnoho), kdyz jsou ockovani, tak se vsude muzou prokazat platnou zelenou Teckou, i kdyz jsou covid pozitivni. To je fakt ulet:-/ Jednoduche, srozumitelne, funkcni - to od ministerstvem zadavane apky fakt ocenuji, pac je to velky krok vpred:) | Besides that the application does not work the purpose of it is to illegally discriminate against citizens. Such applications which support dictatorship regimes should not be allowed in appstore. 0/5 | App now finally works, but deletion of invalid tests doesn't (swiping right the test result). Why is the ""feature"" there? ... And PLEASE, if a review is in English and you wanna respond to it, you should respond in English. I know some people are Czech and write English reviews, but that doesn't apply to everyone. | Přes občasné zádrhely, nyní funguje jak má. | Po pondělím zmatku s aktualizacemi je vše opět funkční. | Aplikace, zničila certifikát jako nevalidni, ještě že jsem v Čechách tento týden. Doporučuji dát další vyznamenání | Píše mi to že očkovanie už nie je platné. Nemôžem aktualizovať parametre. V odpovediach na iné recenzie píšete ze sa zmenili podmienky na území v ČR ale nepamätám si žeby bolo rozhodnuté o tom že očkovanie neplatí. Hrozne načasovanie bez upozornenia, veľa ľudí na túto appku spolieha a nenosí certifikát fyzicky. Edit: už to funguje | We can't open our Tecka for cruise traveling.....disgusting | I cannot update the bloody thing since a month. A good old paper with the printed QR code is more reliable. | Od změny propozic prokázání se nelze načíst. I kdyxbych se uklikala na aktualizaci parametrů. Pochybuji, že tato chyba se objevuje u několika případů... spíš si jí ty 4 miliony uživatelů nevšimli... | Po změně parametrů totální zásek, aktualizaci dle návodu nelze provést, aplikace nic nedělá... K vaší odpovědi: nucena údržba asi těžko probíhá celý den. Papírové certifikáty z důvodu nedostupnosti vašeho serveru nejde jednak vytisknout a jednak ani ověřit aplikací čTečka. | Not working today 22.11. Nemohl jsem se dostat do PL pri letu z Frankfurtu do Katowic Really good job 😖 Edit: Diky za odpoved. Pro priste jsem si uz samozrejme vytiskl starou dobrou papirovou verzi. Bohuzel jsem v stejnem kroku smazal aplikaci, na kterou se neda spolehnout, ze bude fungovat. Tudiz zrejme zbytecna prace a to mi apka prisla prakticka a proto jsem ji veril.... Diskuzi co jsem dneska mel ve Frankfurtu s nemeckym policistou (co vyznava skutecny ordnung a uplne nejde ukecavat) nepreji ani nepriteli, co tohle zpusobil. Dost dlouho to vypadalo na vynuceny PCR test a 10dni karanteny nekde v D. | Nefunguje | 21.11.2021 app is totally unusable! Shame to CZ. | Worked quite fine, but from today all certificates are 'red' and with message: 'Last update of parameters is older than 24 hours'. When I click on 'update parameters' nothing happens... | Nefunkční šmejd. Testuje to i váš někdo? Zátěžový test je u vás sprostý slovo, že? NESCHOPNÍ IDIOTI. | Nejde update, nefunguje | terrible and not working now | Mrdka, ukazuje invalid certifikat ockovani :) skvela prace 0/5 | Neplatné certifikáty.. Ani update parametrů nepomáhá | Validation rule does not exist. Pretty useless right now. | My vaccination is displayed as invalid because ""Validation rule does not exist""... I tried to update validation rules but nothing happened, even after application is reinstalled... | Po poslední aktualizaci se nedaří aktualizovat parametry. Android 11 | Po spravnem zobrazeni certifikatu dnes nefunguje, vlastne od 19.11 neukazuje certifikat spravne. Lze jej ovsem pres tecku stahnout v poradku. Co stale nejde v anglicke verzi ""aktualizovat parametry"". UPDATE : ted vsechno jde jak ma | aplikace zobrazuje validny certifikat cervene | Dnešní aktualizace (22.11.2021) katastrofa. Všechny certifikáty neplatné. Oficiální vyjadrení NAKIT jak problém odstranit (aktualizace parametrů) nefunguje. Komunikace k uživatelům zoufalá (jak postupovat pokud problém trva, za jak dlouho bude problém odstraněn atd.). | Po zavedení nových pravidel nefunkční. | Dobrý den, mám platné očkování, přesto v aplikaci je uvedeno invalid. Našla jsem si návod, že mám kliknout na tlačítko aktualizovat. V mé appce není tlačítko aktualizovat... Jsem na služební cestě, děkuji za zpříjemní... | Nefunguje vám to. Nedaří se aktualizovat parametry, po manuálním kliknutí se nic neděje | Platné očkování ukazuje jako neplatné. Aktualizace parametrů nefunguje. Problém přetrvává i po opětovné instalaci. | fails to update status, I appear to be unvaccinated | Přestalo fungovat. Platný certifikát o očkování je nyní červený. Tohle se zase někomu nepovedlo. | Nemám tady žádné testy | Unreliable. Validation rule does not exist. | Dnes, při kontrole v restauraci jsem přišla na to, že Tečka vyhazuje chybovou hlášku, že data nebyla updatovana v posledních 24 hodinácha ukazuje všechny certifikáty (včetně očkování) jako neplatné. Telefon mám připojený na datech 24/7 a stejná hláška vyskočila i kolegům, takže předpokládám, že se jedná o chybu na straně aplikace a bude doručen rychlý fix. | Ukazuje ""Poslední aktualizace parametrů starší než 24 hodin"" i po několika vypnutích a zapnutích, tlačítko ""aktualizovat parametry"" nedělá nic, telefon je přitom připojen k internetu. Od takto důležité aplikace jsem očekávala větší spolehlivost. | Nefunguje aktualizace certifikátů | Příšerné. Po aktualizaci mi chybné ukazuje stav po očkování jako neplatný. Zákaznická linka hovor automaticky položí a není možné čekat na volného operátora, prvně se ukazuje podsvícení s QR kódem, které výpis oči, i když se chci podívat na info o očkování... Hodně špatné. Kdybych mohl jinak, nikdy bych nepoužíval. | Banda tupych neschopnych idiotu... Kdyz uz vyzadujete, ze se MUSIM prokazat ockovanim vsude kam jdu, zaridte at tenhle nesmysl funguje. Aktualizace cerifikatu selhala, pri pokusu o relogin na me vyskoci za probiha udrzba... Vazne? V pondeli v 11 dopoledne? Nemit nahodou u sebe papir o ockovani, nepusti me na certifikaci za nekolik set dolaru! | Můj platný očkovací certifikát ukazuje jako neplatný. Aktualizace parametrů nefunguje - poslední aktualizace parametrů proběhla před 2 dny, ať dělám co dělám. Odinstalováno, budu ukazovat jen pdfko. | Nelze do aplikace nahrát platný certifikát přes SMS. Po dvou pokusech bohužel nic. Podotýkám, že platný certifikát mám a je dostupný na centrální adrese ocko.uzis.cz (mám jej i stažený ve formátu PDF). | Česko Česko Česko🙄 | The app is all in the Czech language and very difficult to navigate. I gave up and printed my document. I have now given the app a 5 star rating as instructions appeared in English... thank you! | Tak jsem prave zjistil, ze tu slavnou aplikaci ""tecka"" muzu pouzit na prokazani bezinfekcnosti a jit do kina. A to prestoze ma aktualni (pro jistotu rucne i aktualizovana) data, pozitivni 4 dni stary test ze soboty zavedeny do systemu a narizena izolace tomu vubec nevadi. Elektronicka online pripojena aplikace, ktera se chova stejne ""aktualne"" jako papir. | Appka propagovana dezinformacni kampaní veřejnými médii. | Freedom app! | It works | Jako systémový jazyk Androidu mám angličtinu, a proto se i Tečka zobrazuje anglicky. Nevím, jak mám detail certifikátu přepnout do češtiny. I když je EN škrtnuté, jsou detaily stále anglicky. Když někde ukazuji na mobilu detail certifikátu, je obsluha z anglického jazyka zmatena. Přitom by stačilo přidat možnost změnit si jazyk (cz/en) v nastavení aplikace (texty už přeložené máte). | Hello, I got the certificate and now I forgot my password to enter to the app Tečka.  How can I reset the password? Or do I need to delete the app and do it again? | Good system. | Nějak nechápu, proč se v aplikaci čtečka komukoliv kdo ""kontroluje"" zobrazuje moje jméno a datum narození. Obsluhu ( v jakémkoliv podniku ) tato informace absolutně nezajímá a nedokáže ji ani ověřit. Tohle se mi opravdu nelíbí. | Funguje tak jak má. | Kde jsou moje testy? | Nelze se přihlásit. | Funguje dobře, všudy kudy chodím mám najednou 5G | Aplikace nefunguje. V momentě, kdy musím tečku ukazovat všude, se rozhodne, že potřebuji aktualizaci. Aktualizace nejde stáhnout. Po odinstalaci nejde ani stáhnout zpět. Super. | Dnes jsem vyzkoušel a zatím funguje. | App whose only purpose is to show picture requires update to work. | Impossible to load my certificate. I'm able to go till the SMS step, but after that, the page shows error. Same for NIA page - The option to sign in with electronics ID, never loads. | Neni mozne obnovit zapomenuty pin 👎 | Přidat přes SMS certifikát tak jednoduše nejde.. je to velice neintuitivní.. odkáže vás to na ocko.uzis kde si musíte stáhnout certifikát v PDF formě do mobilu, vrátit se do aplikace a přidat certifikát ve skutečnosti přes QR kód kde se otevře kamera tam je potřeba kliknout na ikonku souboru s lupou jež vás odkáže do adresáře fotek. Ten je potřeba přepnout na stažené soubory kam se stáhnul certifikát a z něj si aplikace ověří QR a přidá certifikát do aplikace.. moje máti by to nezvládla. Děs | Chcete si přečíst info o podmínkách použití a sběru osobních údajů? Smůla. Stránka na toto téma neexistuje :-p Tvárnice a vládní aplikace nebrat! | Pracuje jak má | Tak tohle musel navrhovat někdo pod vlivem.Nejsem IT specialista , nicméně nejsem IT negramota , ale tohle je absolutně nanic apka. | Forced updates. | Not really usable if you use a VPN (for example to bee safe at a foreign airport wifi), as uzis.cz considers it an attack and blocks access. | I have no sms service abroad, just email, how can i get an id code.. | Nejdebilnejsi apka co existuje. Vůbec mi nechce nic normalne udělát. Bože s tím je ***ni | Won't show my test results when attempting through SMS. Claims that ""I attempted to many logins"" with no other Information. What's the point of doing a test when I cannot even access my results and a certificate when I need to travel? Can't believe tax money actually goes to this. | Doesnt even download | Slozita registrace. Nekdy priste to zkusim znovu. Zatim jsem odinstalival, aby to neprekazelo v telefonu. | Od nainstalování a nastavení byla apka otevřená přesně 0 krát. | Je to na nic | Mamka má telefon (Samsung, ne žádný noname) z r. 2015 a aplikace jí nejde stáhnout, že zařízení není podporováno. Stejně tak když si otevře ocko.uzis, tak je stránka rozházená a nejde na nic kliknout (ostatní stránky se načítají úplně normálně). Super motivace pro lidi, aby aplikaci používali. :))) | Obecně asi fajn. Přihlášení přes NIA funguje krásně a zobrazuje se co má. ALE bylo by u očkování fajn mít v detailech vypsaná data jednotlivých dávek. Na některých letištích to po mně chtěli. EDIT: Díky za odpověď, ale s prominutím, buď jste nečetli mé hodnocení nebo nevíte, o čem mluvíte. Data jednotlivých dávek v aplikaci nejsou. | Nejde validace pro jiné země. Z toho důvodu je to pro mě k ničemu. A kdy ta nova verze bude? Tohle neni nic sloziteho na vyvoj. Nechapu co vam na tom trva tak dlouho. | Certifikáty s prošlou platnosti označovat jako nevalidní (invalid vs expired)? Jako srsly? | After installation and some firewall tunning everything works fine. | Nefunkcni, registrace pres sms nefunguje Ani jedna varianta... | Why are you making it so hard to get vaccination certificates? I tried to log in via SMS code SO MANY TIMES until it finally worked. When I logged in, it didn't update my certificates. Very frustrating. | Dumpsterfire. Too many login attempts error while desperately trying to add my wife's and a child's test results. There is no way of adding my child - I tried all possible combinations of phone number and date of birth or rodne cislo. So no vacation for us. I hope nobody violently smashed his phone through a computer display while using this. | The qr code scanner did very much not work, even tho my normal app on scanning qr codes scanned the code just fine. This app... No. | App stops working while abroad because ""I no longer have the latest version"" - thanks for stalling me at the border, stupid developers | 6-ti místný pin, to dělal nějaký výmaz? Chci jméno, nebuďte slušnej | Terrible | As usual with state projects. Fail. Wrong order of item highlight mode (scanning mode) and detail mode. Language change not possible from menu (only locale from system). Cannot be used for inspection abroad (even not within EU). Cannot delete old expired certificates/tests. | Když zapomenete pin, musíte celou aplikaci odinstalovat a začít znovu. Až po několikátém jednorázovém kódu začala aplikace fungovat. Jinak je vcelku jednoduchá a bez problémů,ale tyto dvě věci jsou zásadní. | So much bad. | Celkem funguje, ale dá se nějak vyresetovat PIN? Bohužel jsem PIN zapomněl. Naštěstí jsem zapl i přihlášení pomocí otisku prstu, ale ne vždy se takto přihlásit povede (asi rozpraskane prsty) nebo až na x-tý pokus. No a pokud jsem v aplikaci už přihlášený a chci ten PIN změnit, tak to chce zadat ten starý, který si nepomatuju. Navíc proč, když už jsem ověřený otiskem? Ani odinstalace aplikace nepomohla - drží si starý PIN. Tohle není úplně domyšlené. Třeba reset s sms ověřením by stačil. | ocko.uzis.cz is currently unable to handle this request. | I had a antigen test on Friday, 13.08. around 18 o'clock in order to load the test result into the app to have it ready for travel abroad via plane, planned for Saturday morning, 14.08. I received the sms which stated that I'm negative, after that I went on and wanted to load the result into the app, but i haven't managed to do so till saturday eve, so I have lost my flight, because I wasn't accepted to board which was the result of the test not loading on time. I will complain further. | Reakce na odpoved: Nejde o jazyk certifikatu, ale cele appky. A to spatne hodnoceni je hlavne za to, ze zdrojovy kod neni otevreny. Nechapu proc Prosle certifikaty jsou nahore nad platnymi. Nejde prehodit jazyk na jiny nez systemovy. Jaktoze tahle sranda z mych dani neni opensource... | Nefunguje přihlášení | Vůbec mi nefunguje přihlášení viz SMS | Aplikace je celkem pěkně funkční. Některé UI/UX části aplikace jsou každopádně strašné frustrující. Zejména mě otravuje spodní oranžový panel, který nejde zavřít. Je u něho tlačítko, u kterého by jste čekali, že to udělá, ale ono naprosto nelogicky otevře celou novou stránku?? Takhle ta tlačítka fungovat nemají... Zároveň přidat nějakou lehčí animaci, aby ten pocit z té aplikace byl plynulejší, by vývojáře určitě nazabilo. | Works as it should | Jestliže nějaká aplikace nemá dark mode (tmavý režim). tak už je jasné že je špatná | Nedaří se mi přidat osobu. Vyberu přihlášení přes SMS kód, přesměruje mě to na web, tam se přihlásím, povolím stáhnout certifikát, hodí mě to zpátky do aplikace a nic. Nejsem přihlášený a po kliknutí na SMS kód mě to zase hodí na web, kde už jsem přihlášený. | Nelze, nefunguje | Opravdu potřebujeme aplikaci na to, aby ukázala QR kód? Navíc otravnou? Ze které už je problém i odejít, protože se vrátí na novinky? Neuvěřitelné. | Vyžadování PINu aplikace mi připadá nadbytečné, zvlášť u telefonů s nastaveným zámkem obrazovky. Mělo by být volitelné. Je dobré, že aplikace ukazuje primárně pouze QR kód bez hodnocení platnosti a odlišuje certifikáty načtené pomocí QR kódu, které se neaktualizují. Bylo by ale dobré, aby aplikace také ukazovala platnost podpisu takového QR kódu. Rovněž by se hodily notifikace, když se v aplikaci objeví nový certifikát nebo když některý certifikát přestane být platný. | Udělal jsem 2 vaccine, a v certifikátu uviděl jsem že udělali chybu ve měsíce narození. Nevím jak to upraví!! | Výborná aplikace pro svůj účel. Vývojáři aktivně zlepšují a doplňují chybějící funkce. Skoro se nechce věřit, že je to aplikace pro státní správu :) | Very useful if u wanna travel around EU countries. | Přihlašování je totální katastrofa! Mně se to nějakým zázrakem povedlo, přítelkyni vůbec, SMS s kódem vůbec nepřišla, hrůza! | Doesn't work with QR-code. | I forgot my PIN and can't reset it. What's up with that? Lots of apps have the PIN sign-in option but the other apps allow me to reset it when I forget it. Can you add the reset option? | Hi I got Vaccinated yesterday(02 August) but can't see my Certificate yet? Is that normal? Only can see my old test. Ahoj Včera (2. srpna) jsem byl očkován, ale zatím nevidím svůj certifikát? Je to normální? Vidíte pouze můj starý test. | Works as intended. Very convenient and extraordinarily reliable for a government app. I'm pleasantly shocked, good job. | To many submenus, could have been all the info in one page, made by amator programer. | Takové mrhání penězi daňových poplatníků... | Autentizace přes eIdentitu byla jednoduchá. Od té chvíle se v aplikaci objeví jakákoliv změna (nový test atp.) u mě i manželky. Myslím, že je to velmi pěkně zvládnuté. Jediná (velmi minoritní) výtka je k přepínání jazyků. Mám telefon v angličtině a tudíž jde certifikát přepínat mezi angličtinou a angličtinou. | App doesn't read QR code. Useless. | I would suggest following improvements: A) Valid status of certificates in this app is pretty useless (14 days since the last vaccionation shot was applied). Well, it relies on phone's date so everyone can change phone's date manually and the status is green even 14 days period was not satisfied. Better to relay on network time. B) Built-in QR code reader is too sensitive. It's really hard to scan vaccination certificate into the app. | works fine | Dobře fungující aplikace. Jen by bylo dobré mít možnost změnit jazyk. Jelikož mám telefon v Angličtině, ale zrovna tuto aplikaci bych chtěl mít v Češtině. A tato možnost v aplikaci není. Takže kvůli tomu jen 4 hvězdičky. | Doesn't work. /Nefunguje. | Změna nastavení jazyku nefunguje. | Works perfectly by scanning paper QR code which I previously downloaded as web page and printed to PDF and then to printer. That was easies for me. Thanks. | Pokud to má být aplikace pro cestování do zahraničí bylo by fajn kdyby měla snadné přepnutí do angličtiny zároveň by bylo super kdyby se dokázala řídit pravidly dané země uvedu příklad odjedu do země kde stačí první dávka vakcíny ale když by to chtěl ukázat QR kód tak my bude svítit červený rámeček s tím že je to nedostaciji a ještě český | Nejnovější antigenní test se mi vůbec nenahrál a v aplikaci se to nedá ani nahlásit. QR kód certifikátu nešel (z jasné vytištěné kopie) načíst, musela jsem se přihlašovat přes web. Rozhraní je neuvěřitelně primitivní, ale čekala jsem, že aspoň základ bude fungovat. | QR scan does not function. | Very useful | Zatím aplikace funguje tak jak má. A jedna celku podstatná věc. Jakožto člověk co se orientuje v oblasti IT mi přijde jako celku velká chyba nekontrovat datum na zařízení přijímací data o certifikátech (například datum očkování a druh použité vakcíny) s datem na serveru. Důvod proč to píšu je jednoduchý. Běžný uživatel po provedeném očkování by měl mít certifikát platný až po 2 týdnech od data vakcinace. Nic uživateli nebrání si změnit datum na zařízení a tak systém obelstít. | Dnes jsem byl očkován druhou dávkou. Aplikace píše, že certifikát je nevalidní. Neukazuje ale, kdy začne platit. | Doesn't work.... | Everything works fine | Hrůza a děs! Nepřehledné, nelogické. Určitě to ale stálo milióny. | Když je telefon v angličtině, tlačítko pro přepínání jazyka certifikátu nic nedělá - není možné certifikát zobrazit česky.","{""1"":3292,""2"":418,""3"":746,""4"":735,""5"":2801}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Ministerstvo zdravotnictví České republiky","6973241785916756870","podpora.ict@nakit.cz",,"Palackého náměstí 375/4

Все на польській:( | I know that you can connect Fit with it. But why does it only count walking or excersise calories? Why not calories in the day? When i go to fit, it tells me at the end of the day that i burned, i dont know, 1600 calories, but thats because it counts the non movement calories, like during sleeping. Why not add that? Then i could see that i have to eat like 1200 calories and just walk for 30 mins fast and boom, around 1600 calories down. Im sure its unrealistic to excersise this much in a day | всюди тільки чеська мова і я не бачу де це можна змінити | super, ale chýba mi tam lokalizácia do sk. V ios verzii to problém nie je. | super appka | App looks good, but is there a way how to add products, which are not available in the database? Other apps usually allow you to create new products. | Very ugly, non-intuitive and clogged interface! Extremely annoying ""ad"" to buy the premium version. Doesn't show summary of the meals per day. The only really useful thing is the rich DB with lots of local (CZ) products and meals. That DB added 1 star to my review. Otherwise nutrionix is much, much better, and is fully FREE! | The app is not working properly, very often lagging and its problem to write down and save your meals - due to the ""sorry we currently have problem. Try it in 15 minutes"" | Application is not working perodically each day in the evening. It's starting to be quite annoying | App seems to be great and amazing, but the interesting fact that the app does not have an English language and unfortunately if I want to use it in Ukrainian, I have to switch my system language to Ukrainian, and then I'll be able to find the option to change the language. | The agressive adds in free app. Quite high price for full version. | Aplikácia je dobra. Nový widget je pre mňa zbytočne veľký. Mohli ste ponechať na výber aj pôvodný. | Very good app, easy to use has many products mainly from heart of Europe. 700kc per year is not overpriced since you are the one who has to do the work filling up | I got it!!! | App is useful, but quite often a connection to your cloud service fails (app reports ""something wrong""), regardless of my internet provider | Načítavanie čohokoľvek trvá 200 rokov. | What a language?

Celkom sikovne je rozoznavanie hodnot z odfotenej etikety, co uľahčuje pridávanie chybajucich potravin. Dost nestastny je sposob pocitania dennej bilancie - clovek nevidi vysledny kaloricky deficit. Jediny vacsi minus je ze nie je k dispozicii system aby pouzivatelia mohli zadavat/opravovat potraviny pridane inymi ludmi (napr. doplnenie hmotnosti 1ks, 1 balenia a pod). | HOOOW TO CHANGE LANGUAGE HELP PLS🙏 I LOVE THIS APP BUT HOW TO CHANGE LANGUAGE | Would be a really nice and clean app, but lack of localization and language change is frustrating and could be an easy fix | I have the same problem.when I turned on English on my phone and everything in your app changed to some obscure language, and I couldn't find the settings where I could change it, and that's why the app is good. I would like you to fix this quickly. | It's definitely 5 stars. I am from Ukraine, and I have analysed and tried more then 10 different apps, which could help me with counting calories and other stuff, and i was really suprised, that this app has so many free features, that are available in the paid version from competitors. Barcode scanner works so good, the database is large, and adding meals, food is so easy an intuitive. Thx you guys for your work, i am going to buy the paid version and will support you futher. | App crash when editing weight of eated product. | For some reason default language is Czech, whilst the phone language is English. I don't know how to change language in the app | Defaulted to foreign language interface even though phone language is set to English and no straight forward way to fix. This is not a problem on the Apple version so why is this a problem on the Android version?? | Great app!

I was wondering if there is a possibility to add ""folders"" option to My meals section. I have added few meals there and it is already a mess. I can imagine to structure the list using folders like ""Breakfast"", ""Lunch"", ""Snacks"", basically for user to split the list into sections | Користувалася цим застосунком вже 4 роки, але після оновлення - мова автоматично змінилася, і немає де змінити на відому мені англійську/українську.

Predtym to bolo super kompaktne.Keby viem,ze toto pride, tak si znemoznim update :( | Omg how ca I change the language | Ako jazyk mi dalo automaticky cestinu aj ked som na Slovensku a nemam moznost si to zmenit. Co je trosku problem pri hladani niektorych jedal. | It has really long loading times. When I add a meal, it loads like 7seconds. | There is no proper translation for Ukrainian language. It does not worth to pay. | Bohužel aplikace nerozlišuje rostlinné a živočišné bílkoviny, vysvětlím. Pokud sním balení celozrnného večerního chlebu Penam, aplikace přičte 70g bílkovin, což je samozřejmě správně, ale mým cílem není sníst 150g bílkovin, ale 150g bílkovin s plným spektrem, což si stejně musím dopočítat sám. Teoreticky by šlo tyto bílkoviny přičítat do sacharidů, energetická hodnota je stejná a nemuseli byste přidávat další číslo do aplikace. | Some terms should be explained when pressing (i) button, e.g., PHE... | Don't download this app if you actually care about counting calories.

našla ♥♥ | Nechci premium, přestaňte mi ho pořád strkat pod nos! Tu aplikaci mám asi tři minuty a už jsem asi 20x byla upozorněna že nemám premium.

Also, when searching food I'd like to see first the meals i previously searched. | Чи можу я змінити мову на українську? | Fantastic | Нет русского языка | How is it come that the app had Ukrainian interface and now only Czech and no other languages? Contact me, if you need assistance with localisation | The app looks pretty good, BUT I CAN'T USE IT BECAUE I CAN'T CHANGE THE LANGUAGE!!! Can somebody please tell me how to change it | Aplikace počítá úplně špatné denní příjmy. Jezení podle hodnot vypočítaných aplikací může vést k poruchám příjmu potravy a je opravdu nebezpečné. | Величезний рекламний банер на головній сторінці, який навіть неможливо прибрати. Назва додатку на іноземній мові, навіть після зміни мови додатка. | Ok I found out how to change language. Now I pretty like this app. It has many dishes and foods, which not available in other apps, like banosh. But still, the language problem has to be resolved. And I saw that in past, there wasn't a premium banner, and now there is. Shame | Toto BOLA najlepšia aplikácia svojho druhu. To čo sa s ňou v poslednej dobe stalo je naozaj smutné. Reklamy chápem, ale v tomto prípade je to absolútne prehnané. O čo viac pridali reklám o to viac aplikácia blbne, je plná bugov a nefunguje ako má. Zaspamovať aplikáciu reklamami a pýtať od ľudí peniaze za prémium za aplikáciu, ktorá je v takomto stave mi príde až drzé.

Přidávat do seznamu potravin lze až po měsíci užívání apky, přitom jídla lze ukládat jen z potravin v seznamu, nikoliv vlastních.

Aj keby som nad premium niekedy uvazoval, teraz vam nedam ani korunu. Skutocne napad aky vo svete nema obdobu. A vy napriek tomu tvrdohlavo to tam nechate a na spatnu vazbu od zakaznikov uplne serete. Gratulujem... | Stále bez Premia? Ano. Akorát, že reklamy jsou mnohem méně otravné než vaše oznámení, ještě navíc s rakovinou, jakou jsou emotikony. Aplikace při spouštění často padá. | Why is it only in Czech? | Disturbing ads | Asi si najdu něco jiného upřímně. Reklama doslova blokuje celou stránku. Ne děkuji | In theory this app is very good. In praxis not so much. I am perfectly fine with ads (devs need to eat too, go premium to remove them) but it's unfortunate that adding HUGE push for premium that covers half of the screen gets higher prio than separating apps language from system default (not supperted languages=cz). You can still do it via phone language settings in app languages section (slk, hun, pol, etc) but it's annoying you need to. Calorie part of the app 4*, user interface part 1* | Jestli si myslite, ze si koupim predplatny jen kvuli ty ""otravny reklame"", jak sami rikate, tak ne, presne kvuli tomu si ho nekoupim. | Why is it not possible to change the language? I don't understand Czech | Было тличное приложение. Потом перешло на чешский. Смог вернуть русский, но некоторые пункты меню-всеравно на чешском.. Если бы не это -приложение -супер | Je super, ze aplikace dokaze sledovat i prijem tekutin a ne jenom kalorii z jidla. Je mozne nejakym zpusobem vyhodnocovat kolik tekutin/vody prijmam z potravin?

Support very bad | Chcel by som aby vaša app ešte komunikovala akúkoľvek bluetooth vahou by bolo velmi užitočné | I have the entire program in Polish, and I cannot translate it. How to do it? | Po třech letech nepřetržitého zapisování jsem nucen skončit a hledat jinou aplikaci. Neustále se teď zobrazuje reklama na premium, která je naprosto obstrukční a nejde přes ní vidět ani co zapisuji.. pardon jako nebudu váš rukojmí vy mamlasove, to si radši najdu něco jiného. Navíc ještě s těmi odpornými smajlíky. Nehledě na to že jsem premium měl nejednou, a teď když ho náhodou nemám, tak mě to otravuje permanentně. Reklama v nějakém banneru nahoře nebo dole budiž ale tohle je na zbliti. | Už pár měsíců aplikace při každém spuštění spadne. Nutno spouštět dvakrát. Nyní přibyla otravná reklama na premium přes půlku displeje. | Can you just remove the huge ""buy premium"" banner that takes LITERALLY half of both the main screens? I would consider buying it after a few weeks of usage if I'm satisfied, but this way the app is almost unusable when I have to scroll to see anything meaningful. It's a shame, otherwise looks promising. | V aplikacii neexistuju nastavenia jazyka, aplikacia takisto z nejakeho dovodu neobsahuje niektore potraviny a jedla, ktore na strankach su....ozaj tomu nerozumiem | App is great but current state with non removable add to get premium is so annoying - blocking half of the screen. Add at least button to remove offer if one doesnt want it. So bad and invasive. | After the last update, I suppose, a language of product is automatically changing to Czech after adding to a list. Also, it is always resetting to the top of list after adding a product. | Language problems , ""my meals"" doesn't work , also gives an exaption when I try to edit the daily food. Also I emailed the support , all they could say is to reinstall the app or change my phone language which didn't hel at all , also broken translation not visible in web version at all | App is only in Czech language despite being used in Slovakia. ""My meals"" don't work in the app. Everything, however, works in website interface so I really don't understand why the app can not work the same. I can't even change the app language! Really, no point of using this app as it only frustrates you enough to log into the website anyway. | Become unusable. Cannot add custom food. Language setting works only from start. After reinstalling can't login. Switched to simple link to web app on mobile. Works much more stable | Good application | Great way of tracking my eating habits | We have premium subscription. I always have issues with the language. Despite I have set up the app in Ukrainian it always has Czech language when I browse through some sections of the menu. It is very frustrating, as I can not add any meal then, doesn't fing anything. It is a shame for the devs to have these kind of ridiculous issues unresolved. | После переезда в Канаду поменялся язык приложения на чешский, к сожалению теперь не могу им пользоваться, очень жаль. | Now I know, why am I so fat | Как измерить язык на русский | I have a premium subscription, but the application language suddenly changed to Czech.

To není možné aby to bolo takto komplikovane | Pěkná aplikace. Nerozumím však tomu, proč v grafu ""celkem"" není zahrnuta energie spotřebovává pohybovými aktivitami. Často se tak stává, že hodnoty makroergních fosfátů jsou např. 80%, ale hodnota celkem je záporná, např. -130%. To je samozřejmě jak z matematického, tak z věcného pohledu nesmysl :) Nemohl jsem přijmout -130% kcal :) Jinak celkem spokojenost. | Aplikace je ok, ale pri kazdem prvnim spusteni spadne hned po startu. Druhe spusteni uz funguje. | Абсолютно зіпсований додаток. Немає можливості пошуку продуктів українською. Неможливо змінити більшість описів на укр. Безкоштовна версія лише 7 днів.

UI nie je friendly at all | Is it supposed English? How to switch on English or Ukrainian manually? P.s. found. | Приложение на польском и невозможно поменять язык. | Appka wygląda ładnie. Jeżeli chcecie mogę pomóc z tłumaczeniem w języki polski oraz ukraiński. | Nefunguje bez registrace. | Super aplikacia, jednoducha a bez problemova.

Inak ok. | -11 kg za trištvrteroka. čo treba povedať viac? | Application is great. Nothing fancy but supports almost all cz/sk market. It can be used also for free. However, I lack improvements, transparent changelogs and some vision. For invested money I would like to see something more than only maintainance. | 🌮🍲🤞💪🤸👍🙋🏽‍♂️ | App several times a day switched to Czech language, helps only restart. Android 11, system language is English, app language is Ukrainian. | Я из России, но у меня почему-то приложение отображается на казахстком.

Отличная тех.поддржка, спасибо 💪🏻 | This app is the starter pack for an eating disorder. | Apku jsem používal před několika lety. Byla super. Teď jsem ji chtěl zase používat, ale... Otevírání aplikace je pomale, přihlášení je na několik pokusu. Vyhledání potraviny je také pomalé, ne vždy se podaří na první pokus. Používám android one na Nokia 4.2. | After years the app is getting bloated and databse declines. Now theyintroduce meaningless.notifications that pop up. | Really helpful app. Easy to use for tracking your meals. Few bugs (like searching food in database - it doesn't work properly) and few features might be more UI friendly (copying meals, adding your own meals). But I lost weight. So I guess it works :) I consider updating to the full paid version. | Что с языком?

A po aktualizacii system pridavania jedla este viac komplikovany, zbytocne ste pridali jeden krok navyse len to spomaluje. | Very slow aplication, connection to database stuck on packets so each time when you looking for some food to add you have to wait at least 10 sec and I aam on wifi 6 with 1Gb/s network ... horrible wrote code of aplication | Nice app, I used to like it, but nowdays it became painfully slow. | Incredibly slow! | Dnes stale dostavam empty white window, suroviny najizdeji opravdu pomalu - mam nejnovejsi aktualizaci, android rebootovany, je to opet lednovym provozem? Pokud ano bylo by mozne s timto problemem neco do budoucna udelat? Dekuji | Pěkné UI ale s každou aktualizací horší a horší UX. Při jenom trochu slabším signálu trvá neskutečně dlouho než se cokoli načte. | Po nacitani ciaroveho kodu chybaju produkty v databaze, ktore v Myfitnesspal bezne nacita (to teraz hovorim o Slovensku, v zahranici nenacita ani najbeznejsiu znacku mlieka). Reklamy cez celu obrazovku, ktore vam bloknu mobil na 5 sekund!!! (v tomto smere najhorsia appka aku som kedy mal). Reklamy sa daju vypnut kupou premium, ale to by museli mat dostatok potravin v databaze aby to vobec davalo zmysel. 1* za peknu grafiku a 1* za rychlo reagujuci support aj cez vikend, mile prekvapenie. | Колись була суперова програма. Зараз же ви швидше загнетесь якщо будете їй вірити.

Tried use different languages as the main for UI, but result was the same. Maybe it is some Android version's problem, because my wife hasn't such problem with the app. She has Xiomi Redmi Note 9Pro and I have Meizu Pro 7. | Слабо. Начал использовать, и сразу споткнулся об баги локализации, изменил язык в настройках приложения, только после смены системных настроек. Но потом он снова поменялся на мне не понятный, причем не везде, а только в части приложения. Нельзя добавить свой ингредиент, по крайней мере я за потоком рекламы не нашёл этой возможности. Использовать для себя не готов, не говоря уже о подписке | Terrible service, the language switches itself to Czech. Connection with the database periodically falls at the most inopportune moment. I don't recommend it! | K čemu je funkce oblíbené, když si je stejně pak nemohu zobrazit (nebo jen prvních několik)? | How to change Czech language? This language option is available? | Невозможно пользоваться приложением, разработчики вы чем занимаетесь вообще? может вы исправите проблемы?! почему язык меняется сам по себе?что это такое?!

Gimme this app in English or Polish | Spravte vo widgete tie tlačidlá väčšie (aspoň ich reakčný priestor) a zaplatím si aj Premium na rok | Language issue for Android | Tabulky mi zabírají 12GB z paměti, o místo mi nejde, ale některým lidem by to mohlo znepříjemnit život :) Fotky potravin jsou super nápad, ale ne takto provedené, vždyť je každá fotka jiná, kvůli tomu vypadá celá appka otřesně. | Some random language, I dont know how to change it. Sorry | Problémy s predplatnym během pár dní vyřešeny. | V jednom kuse len reklama.

I've searched for ""таблиця калорійності"" in Play Store and only version I could find was... Czech one (obvious, right?) 3. I've downloaded Czech version and spent 15 minutes to find how to switch languages. The setting was in the least intuitive place. 4. I finally have the Ukrainian version and the app itself is awesome! The process of getting it not so much:) | Cesky, prehledne, skenovani kodu, zatim super, predchozi padani opraveno | I'd like this app. but when I changed my phone language from Russian to English app's language changer to another and I don't know how to return app's language to russian | Super appka, od ciela ma deli uz iba 1 kg ! | Nelze nic vytknout.

Love you Ali Express. | Scam...They do not send items and refused refund for no proof. How cand I send proof for an item I did not get. | Good | Not a bad app, but it can be misleading with the prices when they advertize an item. They will advertise a low price for an item but when you go on it is the accessories for the item the low cost is for and not the item advertised. Just ensure to confirm what you order before you check out. | I like AliExpress but I don't like the app I do not like to get messages on my phone I have to keep blocking AliExpress on my phone to stop the messages I don't like having to do that otherwise shopping wise is okay very good but I guess I'll just have to keep blocking them after I surf the app block it | My first order is so fast delivery to my door step. | Takes to long to get my order | Fast and cool | It good and authentic | Unexpected service 10days delivery to srilanka.i m so happy thx | Delivery is too late | Nice | Los envíos son rápidos | Nice to shop | Superb app | Never any glitches or issues works great.

Hopefully it'll keep it up :) | Very good app | Nice app with budget friendly products | Very good | Love this app well made items for low prices and great shipping discounts | My Tia (aunt) Almost bought over 30 items and each one item had to be paid for shipping, thats really not that bad but the thing is nothing came. Only about 9 or so items came and we tried contacting the useless shops and each one just refused to give refunds. Don't buy all at once I guess but really be careful about the shops who just dip after you pay them because it's common. | excellent Mind-blowing | long travel time | එක්සලනටි | One of the best and fast platform for online shopping | Good & safe trust 100% | I shop with confidence here, as I feel Aliexpress protects my interests. As per other sites, one finds well designed, quality items, but also crappy stuff. One should always do one's research before a purchase, especially when buying items that cost a lot. Not all sellers on the site are genuine. For example, some sell at a low price... but then charge exorbitant prices for delivery. Always be cautious. | Shipping good | Wow | Good, not best | They steal the money, the package does not arrive but they are not ready to return the money, their warranty is worth nothing!!! | It's really important application | Great merchandise! | The prices are nice and cheap, but you cannot pay upon receipt | Decent shopping app, easy to use. | Good experience and they ship very fast to South Africa, some sellers respond quickly and they give you as much info you need on the unit your interested in. Besides the custom or clearance tax for every item u buy on AliExpress- the app is user friendly and very easy to use. Stores should pay for such taxes or 50% of the tax. I was going to rate it 5 stars but because of that, i will give it a 4 which is still good. | Top | Best app | Yes good app real order | Good app | Was n pleasure shopping and received what I was looking for and going to order more thanks | App looks promising. Problem is it crashed twice in the 20 minutes I had it open. | ❤️❤️ | Superb app to use always. Keep it up | Good experience | Very good | Gut shop | Very fast and good qality product | Ali express is a great place to find things for less, I definitely always look on this app before any other place for my items im lookin for. | AMAZING | Experience very 😞😞😞😞😔 | Nice application | Don't use AliExpress anything from AliExpress unless you have no other option, it is full of scams and there is high chance to loose your money or pay a lot for a very low quality product | Not bad 🧿😘 | Bad customer support refusing to refund a package stuck in another part of the country for almost a month. Keep my money but u lost a loyal customer for good. Even the pricing of items is different from user to user. I am getting higher prices than other users. Same items on other platforms like Temu are much cheapher and same quality tested myself. | it does what it should | Customer support is useless. If any seller sends an item that is not as described, don't expect AliExpress customer support to be of any help. All disputes are settled in favour of the sellers, even if the buyer brings concrete evidence supporting his case. | Good | Well | Good | 😀😃😄😁 | Good products,fast delivery comfort to shopping | Great | pretty decent app | I always get what I ordered from this app,and the communication is great | Excellent and can rely on | Good app and fast delivery | very good 💯 and easy to buy things | Search bar did not show what I am searching for, ony similar items from my last orders. Useless if I am unable to find almost anything | No shipping for Indonesia | Nice 🙂 | Some of my items have been delivered in a timely fashion others have not even showing up or say that they're going to refund me | Useful App | Best shopping app for me, algorythm finds what I need in 99% of times. Also can filter by price or popularity. Every month big sales events I get very excited. Also good functionality for wishlists and easy to manage. This app has antidepressant effect on me. | Easily access search for items. Intuitive processes to find and purchase products. Easy payment methods. | Do NOT order on aliexpress. They do not stand behind the item if not received. I got ripped off and they deemed the request invalid and said to contact carrier. DO NOT ORDER ON ALIEXPRESS. | Seems like it's going to be faster shipping than other online companies | Good app Iam kantri sl | Very nice app I really like it | Very proud | Thx Ali Express | I uninstalled the app, unsubscribed to the emails and their still spamming me daily with emails. | Some pages keep loading indefinitely. | Very genuine app..

The delivery price can be x2 than the item price, but the sorting feature doesn't care. 2. The picture of the item and the price don't match when I search.

Free delivery tick doest work well, it shows \""free from xxx dollars\"", I don't want spent more, why you show it's free then?"",""I recently purchased 11 items and 3 of them never arrived and I had trouble getting the refund. The refund process is complicated, confusing and takes too long. Amazon maybe more expensive but at least it doesn't take 4 weeks for delivery and I can track the purchase all the way to my door. It's also alot easier to do refund/returns w Amazon. 3 out of 11 items not showing up is too high of a failure rate for me."",""My items arrive with no problems so far. However, I'm aware of dodgy salesmen in the app too. I doubt you can avoid them in any shopping app like AliExpress. If something sounds technologically impossible, please avoid buying it because it usually is dodgy. Another tip is to read the reviews so you can have an idea of what to expect in terms of quality, shipping & salesmen integrity. I try to go for the shops whose track history is mostly good.

After waiting for two hours, I get an email saying that the courier couldn't reach me. I immediately reached out to foodora through their help center as they say on their website is that they can retry the deliver.

However, they did not inform me that coupon can be used only once. According to support I should have been going myself and see the rules before accepting the coupon. Yeah, sure, on the phone, also I wasn't given any choice. I would prefer money if course. I used half of the coupon, and I thought I will use the other half later. But of course, no. So they simply got 495czk from me for nothing. | Works well enough but when browsing the menu of a restaurant sometimes the content jumps under your fingers because the header ads change (even when they are not visible on the screen). | Uz opet funkcni a prijde mi, ze se i slutba zlepsila. | Na karte udelali double charge a nejdou kontaktovat.

Live support je absolutni must have u donasky. | Had an unpleasant experience with the delivery of my food. I ordered donuts to a reception at my office. During the arrival of the courier I was at a meeting, could not pickup the goods and the courier left with my food. I was told this was unrefundable. | They can easily take your money and time of delivery will constantly grow. Once you ask what's going on they say that courier is unassigned – so they're simply faking delays while not paying enough for stuff. Asked to claim & report and issue – got ""I can't influence the situation"", no idea what they get their salaries for | Kdyz vam neco chybi v objednavce, dostanete voucher, ale kdyz ho vyuzijete, ze si znovu objednate to co vam neprislo, tak vam to pekne nauctujou. | Very poor service You cancelled my order and No REFUND of my money, im always order at the same address and easily find that address ...😒 | App is ""OK"", but the amount of forced adds for discounts etc., kills the user experience. Also sad you need to ""tip"" the driver to be in ""priority delievery"" ... WTH is that? Delivery already adds ""service fee"" for that no? ... Redo app to give tips after delivery not prior to it, esp. when drivers can deliver food spilled, cold, etc. Switching to other delivery app soon I guess. | Podvodná aplikace. Dříve dáme jídlo. Pozor na ně, snaží se vás dostat! Speciálně ten trik s novým zákazníkem je nepříjemný! | Please outsource your mobile IT services to someone competent. About one in three of your ads freeze, requiring restart of the app from which the ad ran. Super annoying. I'm definitely not using your app any more - who knows what eldritch horrors lurk within? Edit: The ads freeze in all apps where they appear. No other companies' ads do this on my phone. | Quality of deliveries going down, good customer support otherwise totally terrible experience, after years deleted ACC and don't trust to return... | Fakt mě štve, že jste ABSOLUTNĚ nespolehliví, co se týká času doručení. Přece není možný, že si člověk objedná jídlo, vy tvrdí že že u nás bude za 45 minut, uběhne 55 munut a vy ještě ani nepotvrdíte objednávku, nedáte vědět,nic ? To jste se snad zbláznili tvl, fakt. Doručujete to snad v kočáře Popelky nebo co???? | I disabled promo notfications but this app keeps spamming me with offers several times a day | The app is great there is a lot of discounts and promocodes but I hate it cause I can't use them because if you have a promocode or if the food have a discount you need to pay by card (put your card information) you can't choose to buy by cash it doesn't show up and if you shop without discounts you can pay by cash but it will cost you a lot why did they make it like that horrible desicion😔😔😔 | Snadná registrace, nechce to po vás 60 různých ověření když se prihlašujete na jiném zařízení, oproti WOLTu kde jsem si pro to jídlo nakonec radši došel sám. | just a scam, careful, they trying to steal from you, prices raised about 100 % more in selected restaurants, how these criminals are allowed in app store | Značka foodora hodně pozvedla standard. | Easy to use, very handy. | it is nearly impossible to receive a food. Waited for 2.5 hours for my delivery. And it's not the first time I have such an issue. But when I ordered the food - delivery time was 50 min, not even close to real delivery time | They stopped accepting electronic meal vouchers. Now they just take the money, cancel the order, and never refund anything. Support doesn't do anything. Electronic meal vouchers were the only reason I was using this garbage. | Vynikajicí | The worth delivery service. Order are always late. Often not complete. | Edit: Tak jsem zase 2x objednával - dodací doba 90 minut u obou. Rebrand špatné službě nemůže pomoci....Původní verze: Fakt naposled co jsem si tady objednával. Čekací doba 2x delší než u konkurence. Nejde zrušit objednávku minutu po zadání. Moje adresa podle nich neexistuje. | Good | -5 stars, the worst food ordering app ever, thanks to them competition have extra job. Hungry spend 2times over 1 hour trying to order, either didn't work or the checkout price allmost double out of nowhere. | neslo zaplatit zadanou kartou, duvod neuveden, pred Ggl pay to slo 🤪 casto nejde objednat z Wokin, jsem smutny ... nesel update, neslo tedy objednat, iz je to davno -Update neproběhne 1.4.2022 🤨 | Huraaqaa | K čemu mi je odhad casu když dopředu víte že ho nedokážete splnit. Je to prostě příšerný. ""Vaši příští objednávku vyřídíme lépe"" - ne já si už nic neobjednam, protože já si cením svůj čas. Kdybyste aspoň vrátili čast peněz... Ceny vyšší v nabídce než při checkoutu. Prostě celkově je to trash. | В последнее время постоянно держат заказ неподтверждённым по часу, а потом отменяют | Jídlo cca za 1000 jsem objednal v 17:30. V 18:30 aplikace tvrdí dalších 90 minut. Přes hodinu se snažím objednávku zrušit. Centrum pomocí nefunguje a stále se mě to snažilo připojit do nějakého chatu. V 19:40 mi přijde email že jídlo bylo doručeno a tak už nic zrušit nejde. Asi v půl jedenácté zvoní kurýr u baráku. Už asi týden mám požadavek na zákaznické podpoře, ale nikdo nereaguje :-(. Super služba fakt :-(. | Why not translate the text to English?? | Za stejnou objednávku ve Foodora 441 Kč a v KFC rozvoz 300. Jejich premium s dopravou zdarma se nevztahuje na většinu restauraci ale to se dozvíte až po zaplacení (určitě to je někde schované malými písmenky). Pokud máte možnost, tak ruce pryč a radši objednat napřímo. | Fairly easy to use | Pro subscription is very useless. Do not buy it. | Byla by to fajn aplikace když by šla s dobou a když by tam byly nějaké normální způsoby platby. Třeba bitcoin, takhle vám to nabídne nějaký kupón a platba jen zastaralou kartou ( ani nenabídne hotově ), takže v dnešní době nepoužitelné. Lepší tedy zajít přímo do restaurace a zaplatit tam bitcoinem, v dnešní době už cca 1000 restaurací přes QRko v ČR toto umožňuje. Snad Foodora půjde časem s dobou a nabídne tuto možnost také | V aplikaci se dá zobrazit čas doručení, ale ne čas objednání, tím pádem nelze zjistit zákazníkovi, kolik trvalo dodání objednávky. Trošku nefér přístup. | Odhady časů rozvozu neodpovídají realitě. I když mají problémy s rozvozem, stále klamou nereslistickym odhadem při objednávce. Po zaplacení jsou odhady dosti náhodné, 10-20min, 30-40, 10-20, 50-60 a pořád dokola, až to trvá přes 2h tj 3x tak dlouho než úvodní odhad. Není to poprvé, kdy s nimi mám problém. Zatím jsem používal jen Foodoru k dovážení jídla a tak je čas se rozloučit a zkusit nějakou novou službu. Nespolehlivost a klamání zákazníků jsou pro mě stopkou. | It takes 90 minutes to deliver order for 2 kms, two orders twice in a row same result. They will ruin your day with useless support that knows only how to give you BS voucher or cancel your order. THEY DO NOTHING TO IMPROVE THEIR MISTAKES SO THEY DO NOT APPEAR AGAIN. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU. DO NOT RECOMMEND, SAVE YOUR TIME EVADING THIS USELESS OVERPRICED SERVICE | I was waiting 3 hours for the delivery. Shops were canceling order after 1-2 hours of waiting. | Až moc pop-upu (výběr adresy, blesková sleva, vyhřej iPhone a td.) - dejte mi už konečně objednat jídlo. No, a ještě nějaká reklama po objednávce. | Jidlo sice dovezou, ale kazdy den otravuji s recenzi na stejnou restauraci i ba jidlo, ktere jsem mel uz mnohokrat. Vyhledavani jidel nefunguje, vysledky jsou restaurace, ktere jidlo nemaji (placena reklama, aby se objevili v kazdem hledani?). | When this was still Dáme Jídlo the experience was great but since the acquisition they introduced more and more extra charges. The last one is ridiculous. If you don't pay extra to guarantee the courier goes directly from restaurant to your home, he actually picks up the food and then drives it around for more than half an hour when delivering to other customers (more than 3). It also doubled the estimated delivery time. That's it. I will use any other food delivery service than this one. | vždy pozdě, vždy studené | Verification doesnt work, i cant finish my order. App cant verify 4-digit code correctly. | Dáme jídlo bylo pilířem pro dovoz jídla v Praze, první z prvních. Neustále slevy a nabídky, rychlý rozvoz, jedinečný výběr restaurace. Update 2023: Foodora je horší a horší, a je to opravdu jídlo, dovozy z restaurací jsou delší a delší. Předražené ceny, kopírování systému z jiných aplikací a špatný servis (žádná fungující podpora). Dnes objednávka v 19:18 z restaurace, 20-30 minut odhadované doručení. Trvalo 1 a půl hodiny nyní je 20:42 :) Fakt prosím o zřízení lepšího systému. | One delivery missing 70% of order (support refused to deliver missing items), next order 40 minutes delayed (food cold and soggy, support refused to return money), useless helpline (returning ""credits"" at 10 pm means hungry customer). Would give 0 *s. Brutal. Cancelling my account and never using again. | Exceptional | Nejhorší donášková služba v ČR. Nehodnotím aplikaci ale službu, naprosto otřesné, podpora pomalá a neschopná. Nikomu nedoporučuji 🤙 Edit: Už přes týden to s vámi řeším ale vy mi stále odmítáte vrátit peníze. Nehorázné, jen čekám až to konečně nějak čestně vyřešíte abych si tu vaší zpatlaninu mohl odinstalovat. | Good enough to use by tourist. It has english functions and easy to use | They stole 1000 czk from me 🤬🤬🤬 | The estimate was 25–35 minutes; real delivery took over an hour. Apparently too many customers and too little honesty. I can report one customer less, though. | Looong waiting time. | Had to wait 2 hours for a delivery from McDonald's that's less than 1km away. | User friendly and fast | Aplikace pro mě funguje v pořádku, nikdy jsem s ní neměl problém. Taková malá drobnost by byla aktualizace adres, ale pokud to bere z Google map, tak je vše v pořádku.( Moje adresa není na Google mapách, tak proto). Správnou adresu mám v poznámce a nikdy jsem problém s doručením neměl. | Čekání na objednávku 2 hod, nelze zrušit, mrtvá podpora | easy to use and good variety of restaurants with nice offers :) | Delivery arrived casually 3 HOURS LATE. NO APOLOGY, NO COMMUNICATION, NO CUSTUMOR SERVICE. IN THE END NO FOOD DELIVERED AT ALL!!!!! | Recommended | Good app | Odhad casu kdy jidlo dorazi je extremne nespolehlivy. Opakovane (ca v 30% pripadu) uz se mi stalo ze jidlo dorazilo o pul hodiny pozdeji nez bylo avizovano. | Zákaznická podpora po doruceni spatne objednávky otresna. Mapa v aplikaci ukazuje nereálné polohy. | Good app with good services and wide variety of restaurants/stores to order from. P.S. Thank you for the Foodora PRO free monthly :) | Bad | The prices advertised before placing the order are completely different from the ones at the checkout. The app shows free delivery when you choose, but adds up the delivery cost at checkout, which I consider to be false advertising. The app also adds up ""service fees"". The final price (food and delivery) ends up higher than the same order placed with the competitors despite the same food price and the seemingly better ""initial offer"" that is advertised before the order is actually placed. | Skvela aplikace, nicmene poslednich par dni me to otravuje se zadavanim adresy pri kazdem otevreni aplikace. Uz nekolik let mam vsechny adresy ulozene, neni duvod proc prudit s kazdym otevrenim. Je to tak neuveritelne otravne, ze si kolikrat rozmyslim objednat uz jen kvuli frustraci. | Aplikece je zcela funkční, ale snad se mi nestalo že bych dostal obědnané jídlo načas. Místo 25-30 min dostanu objednávku většinou do 45-70 min. | Just bad | Nejdou vypnout otravné reklamy v notifikacích. Jedině vypnout všechny notifikace, ale pak se zase nedozvím, že mi brzy dorazí jídlo. | Služba na nic. První objednávka bez vysvětlení zrušená. Druhá spíš předkrm než inzerované hlavní jídlo, třetí o 30 minut zpožděná snídaně, navíc úplně studená. Fakt to nemá cenu, ani se slevami, natož bez nich. Radši si zajděte někam poblíž sami. | Great app | Dal bych 4* ale hvězda dolů, dnes opět problém... Objednal jsem si jídlo... 30 min doručení, oki pohoda po 25 mi napsali že nic nebude že je objednávka zrušena protože prodejna nestíhá... Ok stane se dostal jsem kupon jako omluvu... A ejhle on nejde použít pri platbě v hotovosti.. takže nahovno ... Díky takže hodina a čtvrt čekání na jídlo za plnou cenu ... Pohoda | I like ordering food from time to time but recently the app has become really annoying by constantly pushing promotions that are not relevant to me. I tried to turn off the ""Special offers and promotions"" notification category but the notification spam continues | perfekt | One complaint... there is a bonus 150Kč for selected restaurants each day or so. But if the restaurant closes or you add something to the order and then you change your mind in favor of other restaurant then you're losing that bonus. I usually opt for different food delivery app for that day. Edit: This time I couldn't complete my order ""Unknown error, try again later"". Tried different card etc., no success. Restarting app, losing bonus, and voila, I could proceed basically paying 150Kč extra | Giving one start cause I can't give 0. I swapped the language so I could understand and still all the menus and important things are in the original language (great!) Also I was promised discount for first costumers and I haven't seen any discount on my first order... Disappointed with it. Not using it anymore. | Works well once you triple your delivery time. Sad story. 3 stars down... | Such a scam, so expensive. Bolt food is better. | Vyhledávání je katastrofa. Aplikace najde spoustu restaurací, z nichž ani jedna(!!!) nenabízí vyhledávanou položku. | Very well designed! Great service too | Good application to have on the phone . Easy and fast delivery. | After years of semi-daily ordering, it is time to drop the app. Courier can ""eliminate"" your food if you fail to catch him on time for whatever reason. Your food won't be dropped by your first locked door, because that is not a couriers responsibility - Customer support. No refunds. | Nice app | 13 kč poplatek za objednávku, dámejídlo bylo lepší | Bugs everywhere. Seriously, how can an app like this be so broken and inconvenient to use. Even when the app wanted me to rated, it just opened an empty email form, with no address to send to! Food selection is nice though. | Funguje výborně, poskytuje všechny potřebné informace, výběr jídel je fajn, platba bezproblémová, prostě pět hvězdiček jako vyšitých! | Sometimes it is confusing to get to the list of all restaurants | Could not login to google account to check my delivery status I made on the web | You guys are amazing, I'm only giving you 4 stars because your sales aren't great | They advertise to me in English but their app only works in Czech. | No customer service. How many times have not brought my goods, even now when I ordered only polozhki in the store, I brought only 1 of 3. Support does not help in any way, you can say that it does not work at all. It's horrible. I've never seen anything like this and I don't recommend it. It's so exhausting it already makes me want to cry. I'm sorry, but I'm paying for the service as well. This is just Scam and deception. | Super expensive, they are losing track of what it means to be a delivery service and provide premium services and other nonsense. Packaging for 25 czk?? For that 1 cardboard box? And a service fee and other fees... suddenly 1 egg fried rice costs you 300czk Shady business - uninstalled. And no, it is not the same with wolt or bolt food, your deliceries are always 60czk more expensive | I don't like the customer support at all. I received wrong order and they didn't offer me to send me the correct order! Unprofessional approach... | Bohuzel neda se platit bitcoinem, takze v 21. Stoleti k nicemu | Good app, does what you expect from it, user friendly, intuitive and stable so far, no crashes for me. One idea for improvement, after an order, put a status panel for the active order on the app home page. | Too much fees on the customers. Restaurant owners should be paying the delivery fees and ""service fees"". Total service fees are more expesive than the meal itself sometimes which doesnt make any sense to order a meal. | Zrušené, opožděné objednávky - žádný compensation... Několikrát mi restaurace zrušila objednávku po cca 30 min, a od Foodory jen omluva v SMS 🤬. No compensation for the delayed, cancelled orders for the restaurants' side. It happened to me several times, that restaurant has just cancelled my order 30 minutes after, so I had to start with new order from another restaurant. Delayed delivery is every 2nd order... They don't even ask for feedback, how was your order etc.. | Terrible experience with this new company! My wife ordered and asked them to come up using the elevator as it is late and she is alone with 2 babies and can't get down. They were nop we dont come up come down. She had to get with 2 babies ! . We order almost 4 times a week and we give tips to the riders as an apprciation. We won't use this service any more. Using wolt is much better | Can't view reviews in latest update. | Servis je v pořádku, ale když vidím reklamy na foodoru na každém kroku, který udělám na internetu, už se mi ta appka spíš znechutila a raději objednám z jiné, kterou mi nikdo necpe. Nejsem nový zákazník, nemám nárok na objednávky zdarma, nepotřebuji vidět tyto reklamy. | Podvodné promokody v aplikaci a neschopní pracovníci centru podpůry. Aplikace možná funguje dobře, ale nemám rád když se mi někdo snaží podvest. | The application ordered items for me. And payed for me Re: to dev i did And didn't solve anything re: i don't give a freck about your app anymore. And f you if you ask evidence months later. May review will be one star until you have an app. Enjoy | The app is stupid - suggesting a tip for the delivery person before the delivery is completed. If there's a tip option, it should come as a separate (optional) transaction after delivery completed without delay or other problems. Tipping beforehand is simply bad. | The delivery system is the worst, as it usually experiences delays of 7 - 15 minutes. During lunchtime, the delays can extend beyond 1 hour. Moreover, the customer support is also unsatisfactory. | Horrible experiemce, ordered food from restaurant 100m from us (Karlin) and delivery guy went around us(!) To Zizkov, Florenc etc... adding odd 30min for pizza (!) delivery... Application doesn't say anything about how many stops he has remaining etc... | Naprosto mizerná služba. Jídlo objednáno, zaplaceno a 10 minut před doručením objednávka zrušena. Podpora problematická. Dostat z nich peníze je na dlouho. Problemy se opakuji. Nedoporučuji používat. | My delivery was cancelled three times in a row after waiting full estimated time | Chci pochvalit technickou podporu Foodory. Velmi promptne zabezpecili duplikat uctenky. Dobra prace! | Nejotravnejsi aplikace co mam. 3 notifikace za hodinu. | Doesn't work at all. Says no delivery to my address in the city center. Of course there is delivery, but I have to order using the web interface. | My pizza was over 2 hours late and no compensation. Won't even bother with this app or trying to get compensation. | Firma se postupně dosti zhoršila, pasivně agresivní zákaznická podpora v případě stížnosti na kvalitu doručení nebývala za doby Damejidlo zvykem. Pamatujeme lepší časy. | Aplikace je funkční a celkem normální. Otravné jsou velmi časté propagační notifikace. Služba, jako taková, je, nicméně, jako vystřižená z devadesátých let - skryté poplatky, slevy, které jsou ve skutečnosti spíše přirážkami, vše zcela bez záruky. Vaše jídlo bude zpravidla jezdit hodinu po městě, aby vám ho nezletilý kurýr, který nemluví vaším jazykem, zcela studené a zapařené podal okýnkem z auta, ke kterému si musíte dojít přes půl bloku. Bezkonkurenčně nejhorší rozvozová služba ve městě. | The worst possible. Your advertisement is annoying. When trying to close, most of the time the stupid thing opens play store or web page. Therefore I don't want to see your advertising. I dont a i will not use your services as they are unavailable anyway. Do something. | Pořád ruší objednávky, předražený dovoz a neustále problémy s aplikací. Doporučuji Wolt👍🏻 | Delivery fee may say one thing, but right before you order, it can be increased because of busy time - like 0 czk to 110 czk. Very sneaky. Ordered at 11:42 and delivery time said 60 minutes. Received delivery at 13:42. 2 hours later. The app displayed, and the agent wrote continuously only 10 more minutes. To bad I can't tell my hunger that! Offered 200czk vouchure as an appeasement, but we decided to delete the app and let Foodora keep the 200czk. They'll need it at this rate. | Za tu extrémně hlasitou a agresivní reklamu | What even? The inability to sort restaurants by ""open"" is dumb. What even is ""order for later"", did anyone ever use that feature? (I'd be surprised if yes...) The new app is confusing and unintuitive, especially when drunk, the restaurant options also seem to have shrunk... | Podpora je hrozná kupón 200 kč za referall nefungoval ani mě ani kamarádovy pak jsme napsali na podporu po několika hodinách jsme dostali nový kupón ten nefungoval tak jsme napsali na podporu restaurace se už zavřeli a kupón opravili ale dali aby vypršel ten den tak jsem psala znovu na podporu nastavili to na měsíc ale jsem bez jídla a nulová kompenzace také když se podpora zeptá ještě něco a něco připíšu tak si to nepřečtou často a ukončí chat také některé restaurace vůbec nečtou poznámky | Chtěl jsem si koupit PRO, a appka crashuje vždy při přidání platební karty. Po novém updatu mi jen zmizel celý košík (bez žádné historie), appka stále padá při placení. Chtěl jsem zaplatit, ale nejde to. Nové jméno, software ještě horší než předtím, a to už je co říct. Jo a ještě to, že se mi ukazovala reklama po objednání jídla? To je fakt žumpa. EDIT: Jasně, to, aby vám moje platba dorazila, o to se staráte, zbytek je vám ""líto"". Dokud neodstraníte ty hrozné reklamy *po zaplacení*(!), 1🌟👎 | Totally not functioning app. Tried to log in for first time (had a damejidlo account before) had to reset password. When resseting and log in demanding additional stupid email or sms authentication did not work no email no sms. After few tries... Uninstall and take your services to .... Uff tried to look for some food in your app without login in. What a hell is that totally unfriendly, confusing and frustrating to get to any order. Never ever will use you for sure. | I'm sad I cannot attach screenshots of our dialogs with them.. if you are ready to swallow the humiliation when you will be brain***d for two weeks, waiting for them to stop pretending that they are working on a refund for an unfulfilled order, then use it, they deliver food even at night, it's cool. In CZ: Pokud jste připraveni spolknout to ponížení, když vám budou dva týdny vymývat mozek a tvářit se, že se pracuje na vrácení peněz za nesplněnou objednávku, tak toho využijte, jídlo je i v noci | Great service dude, love Daniil. If I could tip the service guy, I would. He solved our problem with wrong order coming in very well. This is a formal thank you to Daniil! Keep being amazing my guy! | Aplikace nutici minimalni castku je pro jednotlivce k nicemu. Polevka se do toho proste nevejde, ani pripadne jeden smart od kfc, takze nezbejva nez nemocny risknout a porusit karantenu a zaject si sam, nebo si objednat neco, co nechci. | You can pay by cash, good offer | The stupid payment gateway doesn't work... I cannot even redeem my coupon | Please | Pozor, mnoho věcí je v aplikaci podvod! U některých restaurací píši doprava zdarma, ale po proklikání je vám doprava naúčtována!! | Nonsensual promise of time delivery thats the main reason why i rate this 1 star. Never ever i recieved my food on time. It is the only thing that matters. Its a food delivery company... What else matters? How can Foodora expalin this? There are no valid excuse to explain this poor customer service. It would take much less time and certainly it would even be cheaper to just drive to any of these restaurant that foodora provides service for yourself.

Na toto tema by bylo skvele bajecne a bozi mit moznost nastaveni zvuku notifikace zvlast pro prichozi a odchozi platby. Prichozi platba vesely zvuk a odchozi smutny jak uz to v zivote byva. Jinak aplikace i banka funguje perfektne. | I v roce 2024 nelze dělat screenshot. A argument bezpečnosti je nesmysl s kterým se uživatelům jen vysmíváte, a zpochybňujete jejich svéprávnost. Již roky neadresovaná problematika interních zpráv a nemožnosti jejich exportu, či kopírování textu byla, a je, také hrozná. | English? All other banks offer their app in English. It's neither complicated or too long... I really dont understand why this reluctance... I guess I'm not the only one.... | Skvělá aplikace. Intuitivní ovládání. Super na připojení účtů z jiných bank | Konečně intuitivní aplikace, která funguje. Díky AirBanko. | Podnikatelská sekce aplikace by potřebovala více odladit. V menu se občas zobrazují neúspěšné platby z osobního účtu. Dále bych chtěl možnost neuvádět na faktuře reklamní sdělení airbank a poslední asi nereálný požadavek je propojení s podnikatelským účtem v jiné bance. | No English option, it's been years, when are you going to swallow your nationalistic pride and make the app more accessible? | New review: Coming back to this review after years. I have tried them and after two weeks of using their bank account I had to call my lawyer to help me out cancel this bank. Fraud and anti-human approach. Previous review: Haven't even tried yet but as I see the fckoff in their replies I wouldn't recommend it either. Replying to english comments in czech language (while saying in czech that communication in English is not a problem) is just freaking rude. | zalozeni uctu pomoci bankovni identity? zapomente, nefunguje na strane airbank (zkouseno ze dvou ruznych bank) ... okamzia aktivace uctu zaslanim 1 Kc z jineho uctu pomoci qr kodu ... zapomente, penize odesly, ucet je mrtvy ... jestli to takhle pujde dal ... | Always accessible, easy to use | Myslím, že to v poslední aktualizaci už trochu přeháníte s tou obří nabídkou dalších produktů na hlavní stránce. Námět: uvítal bych možnost vidět v grafech porovnání mezi roky (kolik jsem měl loni v lednu zůstatek/příjem/výdej vs totéž letos) jinak prima appka. | Lot of promotions of bank services on main screen. But overall nice app with good user experience. I find everything within seconds. | Good job guys! Keep doing what you are doing. The security measurements are spot on and not as ""dumb"" as other reviewers claim. To be honest, I switched to this bank because my primary bank repeating ""for security"" mantra that totally destroyed their app. AirBank is not at this stage yet. And doesn't seem like they'll ever be. Dear dev team, keep going and stay strong. | I have had several czech bank accounts and this is without the doubt the worst experience! Customer support is zero, the app is full of errors, nothing works in this bank. | Perfektni aplikace. | Funguje skvele | Skvela. Hned po ruce. Snadny zachazeni. | Z te aplikace se stava pekny brajgl. Drive jednoducha aplikace s funkcemi po ruce je dnes plna balastu a neprehledna. Sdileni dat se tretimy stranami je uz jen posledni hrebicek do rakve. | Je to dobrý. | Poslední dobou aplikace většinu času nefunguje a píše ""Pracujeme na vylepšení nebo důležité opravě"" toto se děje i několikrát do týdne. Chápu, že je na aplikaci potřeba něco opravit nebo vylepšit, ale už je to příliš často. | Why it doesn't support english language? I have no idea how to work with it! The App shall suport both cesky and anglesky at the same time! I even can refer a good android/apple application developer to add this feature for you! | Easy and safe app. | Moderní a přehledná apka. Tak má internetové bankovnictví vypadat | Vse funguje jak ma. | Intuitive, easy. | Yippeeee | Works like a banking application. Good. | Fakt jsou nejlepší.. :) (y) | Nice and easy | Taky nejsem moc příznivcem doplňků jako Slevomat, Rohlík apod. Podle mě to nemá v aplikaci co dělat. | Very user friendly app | Perfect. | So far soo good | Uživatelský nejpříjemnější bankovní aplikace, vyzkoušel jsem aplikace KB, UniCredit, mBank a ČSOB a rozhodně doporučuji tuto od AirBank. Vše je jednoduché a intuitivní. | Aplikace je sice intuitivní, ale několikrát týdně celý večer až do rána nepoužitelná kvůli výpadkům a údržbám. Je sice fajn, když je o bankovnictví staráno a řeší se různé zabezpečení atd, ale k čemu to je, když je to na úkor toho, že několikrát týdne nezaplatím vůbec nic. Tohle mě nutí uvažovat o změně banky, protože jsem kvůli tomu několikrát nemohl platit přes bankovnictví důležité platby a to klidně i v 7 večer. | Sadly not available in English | It can be even better if they add English language as like in other Czech bank apps | So far everything has been perfectly smooth. | Excellent application, responsive, and very well designed. Quite a few changes to the layout as well, constantly getting upgrades. 10/10 | Aplikace funguje skvěle, pro uživatele velmi přehledná a vše je tam kde má, jen mi zamrzelo, že není možnost screenshotu a přes to, že vlastním Galaxy S23 Ultra se zabezpečením Knox. Rozumím, že je to kvůli bezpečnosti, ale myslím si, že na takové telefony by to mohlo být přístupné, ale jinak můžu airbank a aplikaci My Air jen doporučit. | Mám porovnání mezi čtyřmi bankovními appkami a tahle je nejjednodušší, nejelegantnější a nejintuitivnější! Funguje skvěle. A nevím proč a jak, ale na Pixelu mi funguje Face unlock i fingerprint. | Would you mind returning indicator of 5 required payments on saving account, please. It was user friendly and disappear after some update. | That's great | Ok | intuitive | it will be more better to have english language in the app | dobrý | Pog | Sdílení čehokoliv s třetí stranou v bankovní aplikaci je prasárna, lépe se to popsat nedá. Nechápu jak může být toto zaběhlá praxe. | 11/10/2023 latest fun, Ive opened my own account, changed my phone and got blocked to approve payments. BS looking for new bank for whole family | Při provedení platby (energie, internet), appka mele dokola banner že platba probíhá, minutu se nic neděje, pak hodí chybnou hlášku že ""v tuto chvíli nevíme zda platba proběhla"". Clear cache nepomohl. Převody peněz mezi spořákem a běžným jsou instantní, ale platby na jiný cizí účet zablokuje pokaždé telefon na 2 minuty. Nevěřil jsem že to kdy napíšu, ale zlatá ....ČNÍ banka. | Super | Wonderful | easy, straightforward | Great | Jsem spokojeny.Doufam, ze spolu s Fio vytvori Duopol.Posilam uprimne pozdravy na Alijasku.Diky a majte sa decka,""ale te lipy se nevzdam"". | Yeah | Apka funguje perfektne, s každým update nové funkce pomalu nestíhám sledovat. Spokojenost 😁 | Very good very nice | Velmi dobrá a praktická aplikace. Vím že to s tímhle nesouvisí, ale internetové bankovnictví na webu by si zasloužilo trochu péče. | Zatím výborná zkušenost při použivání aplikace😀👍 | The app is good but i wish it has support for english language | Looking good but help needs a lot more attention hard to find answers to simple actions like transfer money between accounts | zalozeni uctu online je fajn, ale zastarale ceske banky neberou v potaz globalni svet, 6 let ziju v asii, takze tezko tam zadam ceske tel cislo, tezko tam zadam cislo OP kdyz mam jen pas, tezko odeslu overovaci platbu z jineho cesk bank uctu atd..pritom jsem cech a muzu legalne udelat KYC vertifikaci, tak proc je to tak komplikovane | Funguje skvele. Ocenil bych, kdyby pri prevodu mezi obalkami slo doplnit komentar k transakci. Ten uz castecne podpuruje webova verze. | Nefunguje čtení QR kódů. Neostří. | Easily access | Easy to use. Very good app. (Velmi přehldná aplikace). | Stupid and excessive security measures which are difficult to use and conform to. The new ""follow your eye"" feature is beyond assanine and doesn't work. Frustrated as hell. Despite knowing ALL information, cannot register my new phone without traveling 3,000 miles to Prague to a branch. Airbank keeps parroting ""security"" as the reason, but NO OTHER BANK in the world does this nonsense!!!! REPLY: even using Internet banking, the device STILL insists on using follow the eye feature. | Musím říct, že to je dobře zpracovaná aplikace. Možná ještě jedna věc by se hodila - při výpočtu zbývajících peněz po odečtení trvalých plateb přidat možnost něco jako ""virtuálních trvalých plateb"" - tzn. Když vím, že se mi měsíčně automaticky strhávají peníze za službu XYZ, tak abych si mohl nastavit, že se v ten den nejspíš strhne daná platba, a tudíž by se pak tyto platby mohly taky odečíst od zbývajících peněz. | Very intuitive interface | Very happy | Málo intuitivní, uživatelsky velmi nepřívětivá app - nejčastěji používané funkce a info má být na jeden klik, místo toho vám na hlavní stránce nacpou prodejní prostor pro hypotéky, pojištění a další služby (i ty které od nich už máte). Onboarding proces pro disponenta šílenej, nula info servis. | Intuitive and easy to use | All good | It's unbelievable that in the 21st century there is an application that does not support English, despite, having a lot of foreign customers. | Skvěle přehledná | Cobse týká UI, skvela aplikace. Co se týká soukromi a toho co o me zjistuje je uz jina. | Nice app. Would be great if supported also an English version. | Perfect | Pri posledni instalaci do mobilu jsem byl nucen prehodnotit pocet hvezdicek. Prvni prihlaseni se mi na Moto G32 zacyklilo v overeni obliceje, ktere jsem nikdy nemel aktivni a kvuli nemu jsem nedokaz dokoncit pridani noveho telefonu bez navstevy pobocky. Spolu s aktivni reklamou na vsechny sluzby primo v bankovnictvi se aplikace zaradila mezi ostatni, hned vedle CS, CSOB, nebo komercky. Horsi na tom, ze jsem byval spokojen, ale rozvoj jiz tahnou jini. | složitý | Líbí se mi, že na rozdíl od nejmenované banky, od které jsem odešel, je aplikace My Air intuitivní. | Údržba aplikace probíhá teď už několikrát týdně. Člověk si chce udělat pořádek ve financích a nemůže na 6 hodin ke svému účtu, během pracovního týdne. Navíc jste dneska přes noc nepřijímali ani okamžité platby, zkoušeno odeslat z Creditas, RB a Monety. Aplikace je navíc plná balastu jako nevýhodné investice, zbytečné odměny, čti reklamy, pojištění..kéž by to šlo přeorganizovat jako umí Moneta nebo RB, a vše nepotřebné schovat. Kdybych na tenhle účet nebral výplatu, už jsem utekl. | Great app, all paymens details visible and easy to use. Only missing English version 😊 | So secure not even the users can log in and so complex to make the simplest changes... | i would like to have an overview of last payments on the home screen, not links to insurence and mortage -_- but otherwise, app is good | We need English version. Pls | Good app for promotional offers. | Po každom spustení sa vypne so správou že si mám odinštalovať aplikáciu Anydesk. Aplikáciu som si nainštaloval sám a potrebujem ju k práci. | Funguje velmi dobře. Jako jedinou výtku bych viděl to, že si nemůžu přidat předplatné (např. Hbo, netflix) do pravidelných plateb a tudíž se mi nepočítají do budoucích výdajů. | Jedna s nejlepších bankovních aplikací jaké jsem kdy viděl. Naprosto super!! Jednoduchá, intuitivní, ale se všemi funkcemi. | Skvěle fungující, propracovaná a moderní aplikace. | Velmi dobrá appka. Používám na jak na ovládání účtu, potvrzení transakcí. Zároveň nakupuji zahraniční pojištění pro sebe a blízké. Vše velmi jednoduše. | Přešel jsem z nejmenované údajně ""klientsky nepřívětivější žluté banky, která pokračuje služby v Rusku"", se kterou jsem měl léta problémy. Aplikace jako samotná je v mnoha ohledech lepší, banku bych tu hodnotil neměl, avšak prozatím si nemohu stěžovat. | Po změně telefonu na ROG Phone 6 nezaostří QR kód. Jinak super appka. | Po několika měsících útrap s nepřehlednou aplikací Raiffky poté, co mi zrušili Equabank, kde jsem byla spokojená, mě aplikace Air bank naprosto nadchla. Chválím dark mode jako výchozí nastavení a celkově krásně intuitivní ovládání, kdy jsem už první den byla schopná s novým mobilním bankovnictvím bez problému fungovat. Díky za skvěle odvedenou práci :) | Easy | Pěkná aplikace, ale na dětské verzi nefunguje detail karty, aplikace spadne. Odzkoušeno u dvou dětských účtů na dvou různých zařízeních. Už je vše ok 👍 | Need English language. | Aplikace prohledává uložiště telefonu i přes výslovný zákaz. Škoda, dříve jsem byl spokojený, dokonce i reklamy v aplikaci jsem překousl, chápu, musí se vydělávat a toto je jedna z cest. Ale to co dělá teď, je brutálně přes čáru. Základní důvěra mezi bankou a zákazníkem byla porušena=důvod pro změnu banky. Co je vám do toho co za aplikace si instaluju do telefonu? Vidím vaše reakce u ostatních komentářů, chápu že tu jsou ""podvodníci"" atd.. ale vy snad děláte služby jen pro bezsvéprávné lidi? | Katastrofická sprosťárna po poslední aktualizaci: Nevypnutelné vnucování toho co smím mít na svém mobilu. Bylo přidáno vyhledání aplikací v mobilním telefonu, které by mohly být škodlivé při použití MyAir. Nalezené podezřelé aplikace jsou opakovaně oznamovány na všech nárožích a vnucována je jejich odinstalace. Opakování této nabídky a notifikaci nelze vypnout. Skenování telefonu proběhne bez svolení uživatele. Prostě sprosťárna. MyAir začínám používat minimálně. Odmítám opakovanou buzeraci. | User friendly | Nepřehledná. Hlavní stránka je jedna velká reklama která mě nezajímá a nejde odstranit. | Zatím dobrý | Je to spyware | Spolehlivá, přehledná aplikace, mám 2 výhrady: 1) Po přihlášení se hodně těžko hledá mapa bankomatů, nejrychlejší je se odhlásit a otevřít ji z přihlašovací stránky. 2) Hodila by se mi možnost nastavit více upozornění. Většinu financí si nenechávám na běžném účtu a nehlídám ho denně, takže bych využila upozornění typu ""zůstatek klesne pod"". Zároveň se mi ale hodí i upozornění na příchozí platby nad X Kč, když někdo zaplatí fakturu. | Great and easy to use app | zkoušel jsem hodně bank a tato appka je top | App is not working anymore, my money is still in your bank, now i have to travel 100 km to nearest branch... | Ok, it does the job. | Přehledná aplikace | Missing English mutation | I like it 😊 | Nejlepší banka :) Jen pár připomínek k mobilní aplikaci. 1) Chybí uložení stavu před automatickým odhlášením. Například při delším psaní důvodu při uplatnění záruky spokojenosti, se aplikace odhlásí a text se bohužel ztratí. 2) Registrace obličeje by měla být umožněna i v manuálním režimu, tzn. zmáčknutím spouště. Taktéž by mělo být vypnuto zrcadlení fotografie. Kvůli těmto dvoum nedostatkům je proces zdlouhavý a nepříjemný, s mnoha pokusy. 3) Mapa poboček a ATM by měla být rychle přístupná. | Chyba byla opravena. Asi něco s android 13. | Working very well, only thing I miss is the Sepa pay order, it should be automatically included, for example, we are using only sepa in Austria, even for domestic payments and works like a charm 🙂 | Hezká banka | The best bank service in CZ | Please, add English language as an option! | Super easy | Great | Banga | They don't speak English in the bank branches, but mobile app My Air is the best. easy to use even in Czech and i am using it more then 4 years. | Does not have English, but otherwise, very good. | It would be great if the app could support English! Otherwise it's very easy and handy | Try to give English version | Application works fine. Doesn't hang up. Only problem for me personally is lack of English language as option, however with icons I am able to work with it. There are some less friendly functions but it's not app fault, like 3h wait time after registering phone. Nicely made app. Never had issues with it. The design is pretty nice. You can save templates. Coupons are in there and auto apply to your card. You can login easily with fingerprint. QR code work miracles. Just please English. :-) | Nemožnost udělat screenshot, ale na iPhonu tato možnost je. Tudíž nechápu výmluvy o bezpečnosti. | Úžasné, rozhodně lepší jako Raiffeisenbank a jiné velké banky. | Potvrzení platby v internetovém bankovnictví potřebuje trochu doladit | Cool, thanks!!! | The app is very intuitive and it is easy to use. And I really like the dark theme. So much better than the white one which made my eyes hurt. Great app, keep it up. :) | Appka je prehledna a ma vse potrebne funkce. Nicmene AirBank casto vypina sluzby Internetoveho bankovnictvi a appku behem noci az do rana. Takze nemuzete platit ani kartou online, protoze 3D Secure vyzaduje potvrzeni pres appku. Na me opakovane prosby varovat o odstavkach predem alespon emailem, mi rekli, ze to neni mozne a ze to nechteji ani resit. Byl jsem klientem pres 10 let, ale ted odchazim kvuli teto lhostejnosti z jejich strany. | Probíhá ještě vývoj mobilní aplikace? NFC platby nefungují alespoň půl roku, přidání účtu jiné banky ani po 3 měsících z mobilu stále nejde. Připadám si jako tester a podle komentářů nejsem sám. Ani potvrzeni plateb nevyskakuje,, nerozumim k cemu je ta aplikace dobra | V porovnání s aplikacemi jiných bank je to prostě top | I am satisfied | Absolutely clear and easy to use. | Co jste to zase provedli. Po akrualizaci se není možné přihlásit prstem. Skvělé, tohle není poprvé... | user friendly, easy, simple | Nejlepší appka ever. | I do like the app and all available functionality. As non-Czech speaker I do find my way around. But I would give it 5/5 if they make it in EN version available. I recommend airbank to everyone I know and as expat,it includes a lot of foreigners who would then struggle with the app. | Ok | No support for english | Rychlé, přehledně, hodně informací na malém prostoru. Hvězda dolů za odměny, proč musím všechny zapínat manuálně, některé o opakovaně, navrch bez informace o vypnutí odměny. Značení výdajů do skupin si také zaslouží upgrade - pokaždé, když přeznačim výdaj se vrátím na začátek výčtu a pak musím znovu scrolovat dolů abych přeznačil další. Ocenil bych i možnost značení příchozích plateb (např když na dovolené řeším společné výdaje a kamarád mi pošle platbu zpět, toto už není zohledněno v přehledu) | Easy to use, fast and intuitive overview. | Nemám co vytknout. No complaints. | Aplikácia sa mi páči ale kategorizácia jednotlivých platieb nefunguje správne. Po rozkliknuti platby je možné kategóriu zmeniť, neskôr ale v grafoch je zobrazovaná pôvodná kategória, čím sa stávajú pre mňa grafy nepoužiteľné. Prosím o opravu | Great app, I have question please how to allow the screenshot on the app I can't make screenshot. | Nejvšestrannější bankovní appka | Oproti internetovému bankovnictví je mobilní AirBank mnohem modernější a použitelnější. Hodně mi ale chybí detailnější analýza historie. Například průměrné měsíční náklady seskupeny podle kategorií za zvolené období. Mít přehled o tom, kolik průměrně měsíčně zaplatím například za kategorii jídlo je podle mě jeden z nejdůležitějších údajů. Bohužel toto se z historie a grafů bez dodatečných výpočtů vyčíst nedá (lze vidět pouze jednotlivé měsíce zvlášť a nebo pak celkové náklady za rok) | Hezký aplikace. | 1) Extremely aggressive automatic logging off! I have hard time to create a payment with copying data from another app. Or writing a message to support is always a two step process with copy&paste. Very annoying! Nothing to do with security. 2) Half a year old app refuses to open and requests to be updated. That can be very inconvenient! There's no good reason and it's got nothing to do with security either. 3) No english support in the app. Very dumb. Excuses posted here by support sound silly. | Velmi dobrá aplikace přehledná jednoduchá ale funkcni | Používám aplikaci zatím jen chvíli, ale hned od začátku naprostá spokojenost. Aplikace je svižná a intuitivní a zvládám v ní dělat vše, co se svým bankovním účtem potřebuji. | Perfect, no problem at all. | Kdybych byla možnost angličtiny bylo b to nejlepší internetový bankovníctvi | Good bank, nice app. | Maximální spokojenost. | They need an English version. | Best mobile app on the market | Nafejovane,bumpnute reviews 5timi hviezdickami anonymnych userov (dnes lahko zistitelne - hamba vam). Apka je prezleceny AddWare bez anglickej podpory v 21 storoci.. Proste tragicke a nechutne obchodne praktiky. Naopak vas internet banking je jeden z najlepsich co je na trhu. Dcerska spolocnost pod ktorou to bezi vizera z tohto pohladu len ako pracka na prachy... | Výborná aplikace, rychlá podpora a zapracování připomínky do aplikace. Chybí jen možnost povolit/zakázat screenshoty v Nastavení (konkurence umí). | Super app | Aplikace je super splňuje mé očekávání. | Love it | Po resetování telefonu do továrního nastavení už mi nejde aplikace znovu nainstalovat na telefon, i když předtím jsem ji tam měla a normálně fungovala. Telefon je aktualizovaný a nikde se nedá dohledat v čem je problém. Teď jsem na internetu dohledala, že ta nová ""super verze"" je to pro android 4.4, já mám 4.3. Dá se někde stáhnout i starší funkční verze aplikace? V bankovnictví jsem fungovala především přes aplikaci... | July 2018: I opened ""small tariff"" accout, no monthly fees, about $5 fee for each international transfer. Just what I need for my trips between USA - CZ. Knowledgeable banker in Pilsen Republic Square branch, helped me to choose suitable account for me, no stress dealing - thank you. Smooth and pleasant experience. UPDATE 28.8.22 downgraded to 1 star.Personal don't care at Americka branch in Pilsen, messed up documents.Phone customer service is useless. | Hello, please translate the app into English or Ukrainian at least. It's a shame not to have any other language options than Czech. Surely, your clients are not just and only Czechs. And you are a bank so you can get some money and find professional translator(s) for the translation of this app without problems. | The ads are really stepping over the line in the latest update. QA is getting worse and worse - some animations look bad, colors are wrong... Also, English would be nice. Update: By ads I mean discounts for Albert, promoting your loans etc. Don't expect me to improve my star rating in foreseeable future then. 🙂 | Uzivatelsky prijemna aplikace | Žádné chyby nenalezeny. | Nelze nemít lock screen a jen aplikaci odemknout otiskem. Možná nedostatek v systému Android ale uživatelsky nepřijatelné. | Nejlepší bana . | All I need is at my fingertips | Absolutely love it, but would be great to have it in other languages too | Need English language for foreigners | Nejvíc a trvale mi vadí, že mě apka skoro vždy odhlásí, než stihnu něco dořešit, 2min timeout nelze změnit → proto jediná ★. Nelze zobrazit číslo účtu (pošli mi peníze) před přihlášením do aplikace. Banka nehlásí nedostupnost aplikace (při údržbě) předem formou notifikace, takže občas máte smůlu a nelze se chvíli přihlásit. EDIT: Nahrání PDF do šanonu apka nabízí, ale při nahrávání spadne. Crash report i zprávu z apky jsem poslal. Bylo: Neumí nahrát do šanonu PDF. Chybí vám čárka před „a to“. | velmi neuspokojivá zkušenost, je zřejmé, že vývojáři měli eminentní nezájem o kvalitu finálního produktu nebo zákaznickou zkušenost. Nikdy to vůbec nedoporučuji. | Add language change for the app. At least add English... | Nedaří se mi zapnout přihlašování otiskem prstu. Kliknu na přepínač, aplikace mě vyzve k přiložení prstu na čtečku, prst přiložím, dialog zmizí, ale přepínač zůstane vypnutý. | Šíleně složité propojení aplikace s účtem. V jiné bance jsem se přihlásila hned, zde je to zatím na X pokusů neúspěšné | Posledni dva updaty a aplikace pada a ani nenabehne. EDIT: zrejme to dela presun na SD kartu.

Opravdu děs. Takto by žádná ostrá aplikace opravdu fungovat neměla. | No English language in Czech Republic for foreigners.. | one click modification of already paid order without any confirmation, just why?.... | Apka nebere číslo ISIC karty (ve skutečnosti číslo příkazu ISIC - ano jsou to dvě rozdílné věci a Alza je popletla).

No clue about the app. But our experience was not good at all. Bought a washingmachine also paid for it on the spot. Its been 10 days since ordered and every two days they change the delivery time.

Restarting my phone or re-installing the app does not help. I have to go to the website and empty the shopping cart there. Very annoying. | Easy to use and sufficient | Neprehladne možnosti dopravy a platby. V košíku sa mi alza snaží k objednávke predať toľko vecí že ani nevidím čo v košíku vlastne mám.

Ešte treba na aplikácii trochu popracovať. | Bohužel stále vidim minimálně jeden produkt i přes snahu je skrýt skrze tlačítka filtru chatu a šipky.

Unacceptable for me | Extremely slow and buggy. I'm getting a message ""Error occured, please try again later"" which is totally unhelpful and cannot proceed with my purchase. | I will give you zero, I tried to reset my password because I wanted to return some goods. I do not know if it's only me but every time I get an item , it comes with fault. So, I am not able to reset it. It sucks!! switching to DATART | Gazilion bugs, unusable | Sice mám Alza+, ale zásadně nakupuji přes webový eshop. Aplikace se chová divně i na S22 ultra... Kromě občasné chyby při placení mě nejvíce štve neplynulé skrolování... Nedá se na to koukat... | Teljes házhozszállítást kértem, régi készülék elszállításával, kicsomagolással, beszereléssel és csomagolás elszállításával. (7.990 Ft, mindkét opció ki lett pipálva!!) Kizárólag ezen szolgáltatás miatt választottam az Alzát. A régi gépet elvitték, de a szolgáltatás többi része nem valósult meg. A futár cég és az Alza egymásra mutogat, az ügyfél meg szív. | Excellent app | Maximální nespokojenost s podporou v kontaktním centru a službou alza +. Zkrátka přišla jsem o možnost zaplatit při vyzvednutí a hodnocení služeb a výrobků po nákupu tyto služby. Reklamovat taky nějde, kontaktní centrum zájem o prověření nemá ani hovor s operátorem nejde ohodnotit. Výsměch. | Couldn't able to login | Good | Fast, no lugs so far. Recommend | After updating to ver 9.37.0, the app became useless, cannot login at all, error ""AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED, Identity server is down or no internet - Try again""! | Momentalne už nejaký čas nefunguje prihlásenie (aplikácia spadne vždy pri pokuse), takže je nepouziteľná, ale kým fungovala, tak bola skvelá. | Favourites don't work. Open menu shows loading error. Google pay works occasionally. | Nejhorší appka a obchod v ČR. Už se mi stalo tolikrát, že jsem měl všechno v košíku, jim se nepovedla platba a všechno z košíku letělo pryč na /dev/null a musel jsem všechno hledat od začátku. Tolikrát nešlo zboží zaplatit, vyzvednout, schválit... To jsou za ty roky hodiny a dny práce. Smazal jsem účet, odinstalovat appku a už se hned cítím líp. | 🤮 | Vtipné, najít teď kolik recenzí produktů, které byly bezdůvodně zamítnuty... | Nice app | Aplikace často se odhlásí | Aplikace ze začátku byla úžasná s širokým výběrem sortimentu. Ale teď třeba už to tak není, zároveň se aplikace seká, není to nic jako CZC, ale seká se a někdy nejdou načíst samotné produkty. Vždycky jsem byl za to, že Alza je lepší než CZC. Teď je to vyrovnané a možná CZC je lepší, jen kvůli tomu, že byl změněn sortiment zboží a někdy jsou zbytečně předražený ceny u produktů (jako třeba FERA 5 chladič od SPC za 19000KČ). Budu aplikaci nadále využívat, ale jsem zklamán. | Stopped work after last update!!!!! | Pozitivni: Vetsina funkci co je na webu je i v aplikaci, vcetne reklamaci. Negativni: automaticke odhlasovani je opravdu, ale opravdu velmi otravne! Aspon pred nim varujte, at uzivatel nemusi resit prihlasovani, kdyz chce zrovna vyzvednout objednavku. zdrzuje to v nejnevhodnejsi chvili, nove prihlaseni by melo byt jednodussi, treba na jeden otisk prstu, ne to jeste cekat na sms, kterou jsem v nastaveni pred par dny vypnul a dnes byla 2fa znovu zapnuta | Aplikace je povětšinou dobrá ale už podruhé se mi stalo že se aplikace zasekla a má jen genetickou hlášku o zpracování požadavků. restart telefonu změna připojení internetu nic nepomáhá. | Není možnost změnit způsob reklamace z možnosti ""dobropis"", I když reklamujete do šesti měsíců. Když napíšete do komentáře že vyloženě žádáte výměnu, Alza Vám jen vrátí peníze a vyloženě se s Vámi hádá, že jste žádal dobropis a tím pádem je reklamace vyřízená řádně. Tímto jsem přišla o TV a nyní i o hodinky. | Works as expected, or even better :) | Package late, sending annoying messages with deliver date change. I'll never order again. 🤮 | Nutnost stáhnout si pokaždé 40 MB aplikaci pro výdej - proč nelze zahájit výdej přes internet? A když už se chce člověk vyhnout čekání, nemělo by po 15 min 'Ještě chvíli' trvat dalších 20+ minut čekání. A rozhodně ne poprvé. | Keep getting Errors in the app and terrible customer service. No one is there to assist you. | orders can not be paid and also pick up is not working to much often | Bola to veľmi dobre fungujúca aplikácia ale v priebehu posledného polroka ju komplet dosrali. Dark mode nepoužiteľný. V zozname produktov sú náhľadové obrázky strašne malé. Nerozumiem prečo si robíte zo zákazníkov testerov. Nedá sa prihlásiť na viacero účtov naraz, napríklad súkromný a firemný. Vyzdvihnutie cez telefón je pre firmu nepoužiteľné. | Nepracuje při zapnuté VPN. I při vypnuté neustále hlásí infantilní hlášky ""jejda, něco se pokazilo"". | Worst eshop ever. For these guys, delivery date is clearly just a way of attracting customers. Absolute unprofessional. | Very poor services. | Zobrazit v 3D prostoru nefunguje, píše chybovou hlášku: Nepodařilo se najít aplikaci pro otevření | Nice | A lot of times error: something gone wrong | Nejlepší česká appka | Very easy to use, the UI behaves as expected.

Hat megnezte a rendszerben es az elozovel ellentetben mar idopontot sem kamuzott be, hogy mikor meltoztatnak keresni | Very laggy, unable to use. Cart is unresponsive | Have you even opened the app yourself? White text on gray background? Pathetic... | Posledních pár měsíců je aplikace nepoužitelná. Neustále mne odhlašuje a 2FA lze pouze přes smsku. Nerozumím, proč si aplikace nepamatuje uživatelské jméno a nelze se přihlašovat biometricky. | Easy to use. Easy navigation, precise search, fast loading, nice interface. Products have such great category/ subcategories overview that I am always finding what I need. I love ""save for later"" option, and making my own folders for things I am often buying. I am using Alza app for almost everything I need for my family, home, car.. There is also good description of products. | I am trying to choose Hungary as shipping country but it says error so I cannot use the app at all. | App doesn't work. Search results are always blank | Best Shopping app on the market | Zrušil jsem dva dny zpožděnou objednávku. Objevilo se potvrzení, že objednávka je zrušena. Za hodinu mi přišel mail, že má objednávka přijde o něco dříve. Otevřel jsem aplikaci a hle: objednávka zrušena není a běží dál. To zavání nekalostí, že? Zrušil jsem znovu, uvidíme... Aplikace (a vlastně celý obchod) se snaží vnutit člověku rozbalené zboží (za které občas vydáváte i zboží značně používané). Nativně spouští spoustu otravných notifikací a má sklony neustále běžet na pozadí... Celkem děs. | App itself is fine however the dark mode has a split personality. Sometimes you get light mode, sometimes dark, sometimes both at once which is a problem because you get a white background with a white dark mode text so it's unreadable. I would suggest fixing the dark mode or at least make an option to choose between light and dark modes. | Quick and Great service | In the name of al that is unholy, why have you pushed out a dark theme without proper testing? The filter menu is basically invisible, especially the sliders are unreadable (length of cables for example) come on people, you're a serious company! Don't you fire the person responsible for this, just kick them in the shin because I'm half thankful that you brought dark mode. Half, because it's half baked | No login option. Cant change color settings. I was standing front of the Alza Box to get my order. I can't login my account. Can't pay my order because the Alza Box pin terminal was death such this app | Pro Alzu funguje App dobre. Ale uplne jste se vykaslali na dodatkove moznosti prepravy, ktere delate. Aukro mi poslalo zasilku pres Zasilkovnu, ale do AlzaBoxu. Indikace v jejich App byla silne nekonsistentni a jen se zobrazilo Heslo. Ale nebylo jasne, co se s nim ma delat! U nas stoji oba 2 ty boxy vedle sebe. Pritom by stacilo, kdyby App Alza laskave zasilku registrovala, a rekla, ze zde mam i vec ze Zasilkovny. Stal jsem tam 30min, zkousel ruzne metody a Googlil jsem, ale pak musel jit domu. | S22 Ultra, Android 12: I get a lot of black artifacts in product pages in dark mode. I'm unable to see text and sometimes it's just pure black page. You'd might to look into that. | Poor performance, plus currently due to unfortunate choice color theme (unable to modify on the user side) titles and texts are barely readable (gray text on white tiles).

It's perfect for users who have limited storage space or slower internet connections. FB Lite retains the most essential features of the main Facebook app, such as posting updates, sharing photos and videos, and staying connected with friends and family. It has a simpler interface and consumes less data, allowing for smoother browsing even in low network conditions. Overall, FB Lite"",""I have Lite because the original used a lot of data in the background, which was messing with my conmection. Notifications rarely work for me; it doesn't let me share (repost) statuses unless I go to their profile and find it; and the app refreshes randomly for no reason (I recommend using a separate app for long statuses/comments so you don't lose what you wrote). Messenger does works in here without needing a separate app, which is great news after the discontinuation of Messenger Lite."",""Since updating yesterday to v. 398.13.0.0.113, it's been repeatedly crashing at random - not fully crashing with the usual toast, just minimised without warning, randomly - then when I switch back to the app it's wiped the draft whatever I was halfway through typing. I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook anyway, given that it's Meta... but I stay because of the supportive and, yes, in some cases life-enhancing groups. Which cannot function when the buggy app steals our words like this."",""Bad experience. Even if you block a page it will still display it in your news feed. You want to see less of the type of suggested page yet it shows more of it when you use show less of this suggestion. You block a page it will temporarily stop showing. After 2 days itvwill appear again in your news feed. It os just annoying that they are not considering their user's preferences."",""I don't like the \""Basic mode plus\"" thingy when I run out of data cause the fb lite won't open if I have no data and I can't use it. And the \""Basic mode plus\"" has 20 mb so it's not a good thing for me. I hope you remove that in the app but overall, it's nice and accessable for those who don't have a wifi or data.

Not only does the Android app keep trying to get me to download a whole bunch of old apps that aren't compatible with my device (or most new devices), the overall service (especially the customer service chat-which is the ONLY way to leave feedback) is just godawful. I keep trying to report the fact that their app for Roku simply does not work the majority of the time, and they keep giving me the same help article despite the fact I reported it's N/A! | Household option is silly - what about divorced parents etc? Just makes me not want to buy my own subscription. Gives the idea about being money hungry and not at all caring about customers. | I wanted cancel auto renewal..and it was possible few years ago..and tasked to cancel and restart .nd as i don't use it but my parents di..i don't want to go into all that ..just wanted the cancel auto renewal and would have activated next month ...but the chat process is so pathetic..that they cut offed me and blocked me.and the Netflix does not have a complaint team. It was strange. Akram the supervisor, then Nikhil and then Aditi .they all told me same things and then cut me off.. | My household has devices now so the app is worthless | Price went way too high | Good apps en good video ang update your video thank you Netflix | Not good aap | Really good can watch all you favorite Netflix shows without any trouble doing so and you can also download things to watch offinle | 2024 Netflix Oscars | Enough is enough. No more price rising please. | I cannot add my phone number as a payment option | I can't cast to my TV if I don't pay more?!?! This made me cancel my subscription entirely, SAD! | best app ever created | had to go back and change my review. this brightness control sucks! some movies ade too dark even with that on. | Doesn't work on my PS4 and since they added this ad plan garbage nothing I want to watch is available and I can no longer use my chromecast. I only have it because it's free on my tmobile plan. I would never pay for such a greedy company and I do not recommend Netflix to anyone who would have to pay. The selection is weak at best past the 6 good shows they offer. I have a better variety on Tubi and they let me use my chromecast and it's free. Netflix is a major disappointment. | Esta nala | They've got to be deleting bad reviews lol. No way this train wreck of an app is 4+ stars lmao | I like it because I watch what I like anytime but I hate when you debit my money before my pay date | Love 😍 it | Pay for a service which you are only allowed to use at one establishment. Disgraceful, will terminate my subscription. | Excellent | Fantastic | Why There is no different types of Font styles are there? | Programming has deteriorated over past few years. | I loved Netflix, back when you and your family could all use your different profiles across all your devices without issues. Yeah that's not happening anymore. Oh, and the add free part that was the main reason you watched here over Hulu? That's gone. Now you have to pay extra for no ads, as if the price hadn't been going up consistently already, pay more for certain movies, and if you have more than one device you have to go through a process to use it cause they don't want people sharing. | Whole day i can't connect on my cell phone app ?!?!?

Keep up the good work guys 😉 | Blocking content on ads plan. Another Price Increase. Also I think it's the only service I have that charges extra for hd and 4k. Only reason I still have Netflix is because I get a price discount from T-MOBILE. | Netflix is the dumbest service ever. App is sluggish at best, service is worst than 5 years ago, house hold rules on ip that are easy bypassed by a home proxy tunneling, show cancelations without any conclusion. Everything is worst than before at a higher price. Let's invest money in a 60 year old fighting a 25 year old influencer idiot that for sure will resolve retention issues. | Good | Not working | If I download any movie or web series from Netflix and keep the monthly plan after eating it, I cannot watch my downloaded movie or web series, this is very wrong, I have to recharge and watch my downloaded movie, please fix it, this is very wrong. | Watch Temporarily forever! I just want to login and watch shows, but they keep asking for temporary codes cuz I've been traveling alot. Garbage!!! | So good that you my friend's | App is not opening | Goodexperience | So excited 😍 I really love Netflix 😊💐 | You know what to do with your household features. | Netflix keep on rejecting my pament method, although my cards still have sufficient funds. When i try to use telco billing also still keep rejected. | App doesn't want to go any further than the startup.

Now I can't even cast to any Chromecast device without going through a convuluted process. It seems like you can only Chromecast easily at home but why do you need to use that when the TV has Netflix app? I will just downgrade the subscription to the lowest tier instead.

I am now trying to get my money back with Google Pay. Don't risk buying anything expensive on Notino. | I've been using Notino for a long time - vide choice and good prices.

LOST CHF 200!!!!!! I ordered online on Dec 5, 2023. I received an empty box. I contacted the customer service when I received the box (all proof recorded). I sent them the photos and videos of the box. I asked them to find me a solution. They're not responding to me with a proper solution. I paid an insurance upon purchasing from their website. That is apparently another waste of money. A piece of advice: do not waste your money on their website / app. You won't receive your items. | O aplicatie foarte utila, intuitivă și ai extra discount dacă comanzi direct din ea. | Absolutely love to shop on this page 😍 | Good app! Great products I recommend. | 👍 | great prices and a very easy ordering experience. I love Notino! | easy to order | Get perfume at bargain price recommend. | the app is fine. the problem is that it is only in Hungarian. You have already developed the same app in English, why not add the option to choose the language regardless of the location? | top company, well recommended | love the price of fragrances you can almost always choose the bottle size | Great offers on some but can get others cheaper elsewhere. Also, not sure if this is due to the app but there isn't a 'pay by Klarna/clearpay' option?... That would've helped:/ | Great selection of perfumes.

Hope one day your product team will make this app useful!"",""This app is honestly horrible. Browsing through the products is annoying, because it constantly shows the same products, over and over again. On top of that when you install it (for example on a new phone) or you sign in again it deletes all the products in your favorites. It happened to me 3 times already and I'm done."",""unclear pricing -overnight changes to pricing without clarity which price you are billed at the end - especially in case of using coupons. coupons not added automatically, you have to search for them and make sure they don't disappear from the basket before you finish shopping. especially during sales they adjust base prices several times a week."",""App works great. I got free delivery when ordering using the app. I hope more promotions like that will be available."",""Soo the app works good , the return system if you respect the requirments for return works very good to,the shipping of products works good in 90% to (only when they are overcrowded in online orders might appear small delays 1-2 days) I wish they could implement ONEY or any system for bank rates so you can go and try different high priced perfumes from brands like Marly,Creed etc... . But 99% of time good services.""]",false,false,false,"com.pragonauts.notino","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pragonauts.notino&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Biggy app. The whole day spent in writing e-mails to customer support who cannot sum two simple digits. | please allow english language choice, we don't all live in places where we speak the local language. This makes navigating through the app more cumbersome than a browser. Edit: Thank you for making the app match and exceed the browser experience | Friday, March 22: I am updating the rating to 4 stars from 1 star. Reason is the app developers team response. Eng is supported language now. (Let's see if I will update again). --- Unhappy with the lack of English language support :( | Option for english missing. LE: Finally ! Maybe next is zalando lounge? | Finally, I can use it in English! It took you 3 years, but still great to see this important improvement! | Excellent returns process, refunded very quickly. | Should have a language option no ONLY a region option. Sometimes English speakers live in a non-English speaking country and visa versa. Edit: they added the option of having English in the app while in a non-English speaking region. 5 stars for listening to their customers! | Sinnlose App. Installiert - gelöscht. Was soll man mit einer Mode App, die keine Bilder lädt? Google Pixel 7 Pro. | What happened to the ecological responsibility filter? Zalando was my favourite shopping app because of this particular filter and now it's gone. Just as the comments on the sellings, where are they? They used to be so helpful when it came to sizing and quality. And the favourites section could be better too - if one could make categories for the articles... I hope you take the feedback into account! | Unable to select language or currency, which is just automatically chosen for you based on your location. In 2024. Yikes. | love it 🫂🤍 | good | Hatte bis jetzt nie Probleme, doch nach einer Aktualisierung hat Zalando all meine Zahlmöglichkeiten gelöscht. Kann aus dem Nichts nur noch per Überweisung zahlen!? Obwohl ich die Kundenservice mehrere Male kontaktiert habe, hat mir niemand weitergeholfen. Sehr enttäuschend. | Very practical but I wish there was a dark mode | Order never sent - No refund possible Simple order. Says ""dispatched"" and ""delayed' in my account so impossible to cancel. The item has not been given to the elivery company. Because its ""dispatched"" you cannot cancel. This is just a fake status as its soon a month since order. This is a big SCAM in my view... I guess some orders work but if you have any issue then you lost your money... | Salen camisetas en oferta ,y cuando vas a elegir la talla resulta que está en oferta solo la XXXL es publicidad engañosa S 140 M 140 L. 140 Xl. 140 XXL 70 € %50 | good👍👍👍 | Happy to see the app being offered in English language, no matter the region. Thanks to the devs for addressing the reviews. | gute Firma | very good nice app .for shop is parfact | I'm think your return features on the app....are poor. There is no way of tracking my return parcel and when I'll receive my refund. | love shopping at Zalando , varitey of petite collection also at reasonable price with quality . return is very easy. | Überteuerte Klamotten, die billige Material-Qualität darstellen. Einmal gekauft, aber niemals wiederholt! | I paid for a Zalando Plus and I still have to pay for 9.9 CHF for Verpackung & Bearbeitung, so it basically has no advantages for me, but on top of it I got an error when I tried to log in | Good opportunity to choose and it has an option to show similar models. | goed | Fast and reliable. Good quality clothes | les prix bas attirent votre attention, puis l'effet kisscool quand vous vous rendez compte que votre taille est souvent plus cher que le prix conseillé. | Facile, beaucoup de choix, et livraison rapide | App doesn't launch | ok | Great shopping the civilised way. | my favorite for 7 years now I really enjoyed shopping here because I get beautiful and quality stuffs | I can't buy!!! I'm told that I cannot pay with the bank card I have and I have to enter another card. This is very ridiculous and shameless from you. If we were rich, we would go and buy from expensive brand shops! | I ordered the Nike dunk low night sky and they sent me fake ones. Shame on you pepole | poor customer support (no free calls in Croatia, why?) and return policy | stress | works terribly on a tablet | pro: nice products, good filters, easy to use con: background could be nicer (more colour), details about current delivery status are barely viewable with icons being too small and not many details about what's next | spitze! | pretty easy to use. known company. | Please raise the salary of the genius minds who thought that not adding ""Change language"" option, and linking the language of the app with residence country was a good idea 👍🏻👍🏻 | KIKO Milano SMART FUSION LIPSTICK KIT - Sminkset - 01 all the must have | beautiful | Suddenly all notifications and mails are in a different language than configured in the app or online. Quite annoying regression bug. | they are the best out there zalando😇 | Very frustrating user experience | App is automatically logging u off every few days and changing language randomly | It has been so many years, but how come there is no option to change the app language. If you choose a country, the app only has the local language. Why not have it in English as well. For this particular reason, it is hard to develop any interest towards browsing products in the app. | No country. | App doesn't work for a few weeks now, always shows an Error Message and shuts down. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it repeatedly, but same problem. | There is issue with mesurement numbers of model height and chlothes | 👍 | I bought an item, but I don't receive a confirmation, I call and no one answer me. I buy again and it is no longer in stock ((( | zniknęły opinie o produktach | Helpful | Simply love it | good app | I used to love the app but now, it's in Croatian and I can't change it back to English! | Brak kategorii Sport dla mężczyzn. Dyskryminacja | Dope👌🏿 | cool | Bad services | App does not allow you to choose a delivery partner at checkout. Makes it quite a pain to arrange alternative delivery. | C'est scandaleux que le seul moyen de paiement possible ce soit des virements bancaires, en 2024.. j'ai écrit et appelé le service client depuis des mois et ça ne marche toujours pas, on m'a demandé de me déconnecter de réinstaller l'application, y a rien qui marche. Je dois faire un virement bancaire et attendre 3 jours pour que Zalando le voit et commence à préparer ma commande.. C'est vraiment dommage, Zalando était une bonne application y a quelques années, c'est devenu obsolète | 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿 | love it | I can't active | Funktioniert nicht mehr. | It was the worst mistake to remove customer reviews from the app. It's been a unique selling factor of Zalando, when compared to current other apps like Asos and Amazon. Now Zalando lost it's advantage and the massive data on customer preferences / size indications. | Awesome | I'm sad that the reviews are gone! Because the reviews helped me! | Fun shopping experience but please set a mode where you can change the side of the shopping beta assistant. As a left handed person it's quite horrible to scroll with having the icon exactly where you want to scroll. Other than that, I'm very happy. Ordering and delivery always work out. The product range is insanely huge and everything is structured so you can get well around | The app is not opening just after it's installed, on Pixel7pro | Nice | excellent | Brands landing pages are very confusing, they are all designed and structured in a different way and it makes really hard to navigate for particular brand. Why they can't be all structured in the same manner, why bother to make individual landing? Very frustrating to be honest. | GOOD | Delivery was maybe a day or two late. Everything was as described. | I wanted to buy a pair of trainers and can't as the browser check gives an error message. | this app is so good and the clothes have good quality 👌 | Slovenia app doesn't offer English | I literally can't pay, I put the card info in, press next and then it just refreshes and deletes my info. | Please do something to stick with language choose by the user, everytime I open the app I need to change back to french ... | good app | Had a previous positive experience on Zalando with orders. Was aware of a price matching policy,so I contacted Zalando as they had a jacket I was interested in purchasing. Contacted their customer service and provided links to the reputable sites as they requested. Declined to match prices multiple times. Was speaking to an agent on an online chat,and they immediately ended the chat after declining!!! An abrupt response and then ends the chat.Extremely rude and unprofessional. | Great site | Good shop, customer service is top notch,high level of professionalism regarding making purchases and returns | I really appreciate | You can't find promotions only products with very small size or extremely big .such a mess | Great to have English as a language option in the App now. Makes it so much easier to shop. However app notifications are still in German. Size guides are also essential for a good shopping experience. | Top Angebote | good for buying, terrible for contacting customer service | good | Z niakeho dôvodu nemôžem posielať svoje zásielky na Zásielkovňu ale inak super | very good 👍 | The color selection is horrible. You click one color, and then the page refreshes, and it's at the beginning of the selection again, and you completely lose the overview! | As a man, I tended to stear clear from fashion apps because of the dominant useage of women,The thought process was that this app caters primarily toward women, Which makes sense business wise. But after trying out Lounge, I wanted to give regular Zalando a try. Was not disappointed, You see, I cannot buy regular shoes because I have flat feet from birth, Which sucks hard but that's life, Zalando is carrying models and makes that other physical stores don't have the wide option.Highly recommend | Won't convert from Spanish to English | No version for tablets ! | good 👍👍😊 | bad | The app is good,and I think the prices are right but if you live in Switzerland and of course you want to shop here,the app only let's you use it in German/French or Italian ,I don't speak neither of these but I would like the be able to select English as an option...that s why I will put 2 stars only,making the app pretty much useless Edit: this function has sience been added,I gave it 5 stars! Good job Zalando! 👏 | Not bad, but there is only the possibility to choose the country and not the language (I live abroad and I'm still learning the local language so I'd like to have the app in English regardless the country). Update: now that it has English as default language it's perfect for me! Thanks! | app is great, just please add english support for the Netherlands | bravo | Great service so far. The only downside is that they're using DHL express which is the worst of the bunch. | 👍 | Great stuff | It was so so | Très belle application malgré les inconvénients dans quelques options comme l'annulation, aucun fenêtre ou informations affichées pour nous disons que l'argent n'est pas retenu comment ça ? Vs prenez tt l'argent en annulation et sans confirmation avec note que rien n'était retenu même la 50% c'est pas logique | Why dont you add language changing option in the app. Or atleast add english language. | sehr active | Aferistai!!! brokuotų daug prekių ir negražina pinigų. | 😍 | So super 😍💙 | Second time to return an item however still have to pay for it . Customer service is very poor that I can't complain and get my money back | good | Orders just don't arrive and customer service is completely useless | nice | I didn't have good experience in Sweden. Fake items with fake prices, looks available but when you buy, you never get it... Deleted! | I always recieve my orders in time ...products are real good deal. | I want to commend your effort and sincerity I goth exactly ohw it was shown on the app ,God bless zalando.guys please buy from them. | English not supported app is very simple like it's recent startup. looks not reliable at all. | Why removing the customer reviews??!😭 you're website is beside that great! | Foarte buna | Great app.! | zalando is an amazing website and so useful 👌 | the best legit online shopping in the world | A bunch of text and spacing doesn't work well. The app would not allow me to add letters to my postal code (it gave me a numeric keyboard to type on) and then wouldn't accept any postal code without letters (which -again- it wouldn't let me enter). Had to go through the desktop website, which was even worse. | loyal interesting quality | Pretty good apps. | danke | I live in Sweden, but speak English. Where language selection? | I am using it for a many years,was very satisfied..but I don't get it why now it's impossible only that when I do order something then in check out says Only Pre Transfer (Bank) available...???... first you have to pay for a things then it's will be shipped out....🙄...as Invoice Isn't available...I always paid by PayPal...and ist not impossible anymore... Very disappointed... | is actually excellent. | Zeleris was meant to deliver my parcel from you, over a week and apparently multiple attempts to deliver (I was at home everyday) my package was lost. Merry Christmas! Never use Zalando | Exellent service!!! | Im very dissapointed the customer reviews of the articles were removed, they were extremely useful since sometimes people would give advice regarding true size/true color or share other characteristics that are not visible in the pictures or shared in the description of the article. Also the ""My favorites"" section is not the best because if you have a long list of favorites it is not posible to categorize them. For the rest the app works really good and service has always been good. | No customer service when I've needed. Hard to see what is paid and what isnt,specially after returning items in an order. | Took my money and the item, been waiting for 3 months to get my refund | Foarte buna iar reducerile sunt senzaționale | Garbage, no option to change language separately from country, so I can't use the app. Super basic thing to not have, not sure why | no dark mode | The app itself is fine enough. The support the company gives is pretty awful, to put it nicely. | Can't put in postcode for address because it brings up a number-omly keyboard when UK postcodes are alphanumeric. | v good | good | Have to change country to change the language of the app. Then I cannot enter my adress. | Top | WORST APP! EL PEOR APLICACIÓN! It is like they planned to steal from people. This App is for online transactions. Why do you make it impossible to find a phone number to speak with customer service? I bought 5 items from zolando. I returned 3 items and all the 3 items were in the same box 📦. They refunded €70.30 for 2 items and I spent €87.87 for these 2 items. One of the 3 items I returned is not been refunded and the item is with them. I am trying to speak with someone but it is impossible. | The prices are more than every other apps and websites | just brilliant 👏 | Have loved all the items bought from here, always have great items in the sale which is a bonus. Highly recommended | UX is terrible! | You should provide an option to change language. It will only change if you select a different country, but it kicks you out from your local store. | snel en duidelijk | Quality products 👌 | Mi experiencia es: la ropa llega siempre perfecta, si tienes que devolver no hay dramas, los precios si eres paciente son excelentes. No conozco app mejor para comprar marcas, la recomiendo. | very nice | Satisfied | love it, whatever I bought from it was of brilliant quality. shipping didn't take too long and very convenient | Super 🙂 | good | Can you please expand your app to more countries | Good place for chopping | I bought a gift voucher and after this I discovered, only in FAQ, that I can't use it for all products on the app, but only for textile products. It's embarrassing, a real rip-off. | 😍😍😍 | Stupid . i orderd shoes & shirt 3 weeks ago but i didn't receive yet. Never going to buy anything | I've added an item to my shopping cart, returned to the app after a couple of hours to complete payment and guess what, shopping cart was empty!!! With other apps I have my items reserved for a minimum of 12 hours! | I have been a costumer since 2018 with this app. Sometimes i got order that is i think old stocks and got holes in it, for example in a tshirt or in a dress. Recently my purchase got lost and they didn't know where it is either. The chat service people are not of a big help either. This will be the last time i will be using this online shopping app. | Goed services | Buggy, my coupon looks like used even if it's not. | There's no possibility to copy order number so that I can pay for the order easily. Do I have to copy the number manually? | Bien. | it is a super shoping place .i am fully satisfied. | I have been a customer for years, consistently using the Plus account and always paying on time. However, it's ridiculous that I can no longer choose my payment method myself, and that I can't pick up my order at the post office, which is really annoying. The app itself has also undergone bad changes, for example, we can no longer filter by brands, and the color filter doesn't work either. I'm going to cancel my premium account and not recommend this app at all. | Very good! Thanks | Ordered size 44 shoes, you sent me 43 because ""you convert international sizes""? Great customer service. Do you change sizes on clothes too without asking customer first? Last pair of shoes I ordered from Zalando. Be warned. | so nice | Wäre auch schön wenn meine Bestellung mal komplett ankommen würde und nicht nur 4 von 13 Artikeln. Kundenservice auch minderwertig. Immer nur so autogenerierte Antworten und bei Problemen wird nicht geholfen und werden somit nicht gelöst. Noch nie etwas so Schlechtes erlebt. | Good | Fashion assistant is an annoying new feature with its button always on the shopping screen. The useful feature of customer ratings and comments for items are now gone as well. | 🤮 | Great app for easy shopping. However, it used to have the PayPal option in the payment section. Why was it removed? | good | NEVER BUY A GIFT CARD. They dont let you use it for the item you want to keep when you returned other orders. It is a money trap | Great app. Would give one star less as Belgium you don't have English as option (for expats it's easy ) | good app but could have english option | My last three orders never came imagine the wasted time and effort not to talk about the disappointment ... I was told logistic problem the first two times and now they are saying it's my fault because I chose a retrieving point that was too small so they refused to accept the delivery how the hell am i supposed to know which retrieving point is big or small, I called twice for the previous orders that never came and I wasn't told. It's a shame though. | Some of the items looks fake or they are just simply poor cheap material .I like the app an service provided . Prices sometimes are fair sometimes overpriced . | I had a good experience with the app (except for the occasional wrong size sent which can happen) until a few months ago, where two features have been removed which used to be determining in me making a purchase: product details (such as fit, material composition) and customer reviews. I haven't trusted buying anything on the app since. Will these ever be reinstated? | one of the best online store you can get quality t-shirts every type of dresses you want for men and women | it's a Best apps | It's been absolutely stressful the last 2 weeks just because I ordered.

What if i need only picture or message. | Attempting to use this to transfer ONLY my text messages (and their multimedia) does not work.

But for those of you Android fanboys(I'm one, too), you guys need to know when to shut up. iOS and Android are two different platforms. Get over it! And for the Apple fanboys out there, Android has security that's pretty advanced compared to iOS's security. The algorithms and all are very complex. Its the users themselves that make Android less secure. But, back to the app, it works :D | Do not buy iPhone. You will never be able to transfer chats from android to iPhone. | Seriously been stucked at ""about 5 minutes"" for centuries, why is it so difficult to move chat, multimillion dollar company with low end app, you guys couldn't care much I see. | Frustrated to the core..

I moved everything first time, including over 2000 photos and videos, in 3 hours, but photos were scattered. So I moved again everything without photos and uploaded photos from drive. WhatsApp didn't move, but I found a solution. I used old iPhone to move WhatsApp on it and upload it to icloud and then just installed it on my new iPhone. I can now say that I wish I had moved to an iPhone earlier. | I am lucky bc when i,m 13 I am not getting a iphone i saw 1 star so DO NOT GET THIS APP | Doesn't work at all unfortunately | Bad | It's bad! I've never faced such terrible slow service in transferring files from android to android. I tried more than 10 times to transfer the files from my android to iphone but all failed.

How can Apple possibly release a broken app onto the market. I have spent hours trying to get this to work, but it keeps on getting stuck on the 9 minutes left mark. | Maybe 20% of the apps moved | Not support | Awesome | تطبيق سئ لا يعمل. Bad app i don't recommend | I never had an iPhone. No idea where this app came from. | it doesnt work | Not effective | Apple needs to fix this app. There are too many complaints in the feedback of bad experiences.

Aber die Verbindung zwischen Tchibo-Konto und Tchibo-Mobil-Konto ist zumindest hakelig. Und es ist soooo nervig, dass man sich so ziemlich jedes Mal neu anmelden muss, wenn man die App öffnet, entweder für Tchibo-Mobil oder den Shop. Und die App merkt sich auch die Zugangsdaten nicht, um sie wenigstens vorzuschlagen. Man muss sie immer umständlich suchen und händisch eingeben, oder von anderswo kopieren.

Something for everyone | Just repackaged web pages wrapped in PhoneGap. Offers almost no benefits over the web site. | The app is a joke. I need to log in all the time. Besides its ugly and 2007 design it often doesn't work so the store card can not be accessed at all. AND LOOSE THAT GERMAN DESCRIPTIONS, IGNORANTS! | Complicated to use as it keeps on jumping back. could be easier to manage.

Android auto, it's so bright that you have to manually dim the screen which is rubbish. | A+++ The more you use it, the better routes it gives you. The best part about the app is the user base being in real time. All we need is a heads up to what's going on ahead of us, and you've executed that 100%. After Trapster, there really hasn't been a maps as helpful. You guys save lives. Actually, the user base saves lives. Thank you all who interact and use waze. We can only make it stronger (no subscription plz.) Seems like that's the direction companies are going. | Good app | Pls back the car option | Hi, ive recorded my wife voice but cannot use it..why ehhh??? Update ( fast response to solve the issue..lebiu gaiss lahh.. 👍👍👍👍) | This is osam app | Alishahg | Prior to the last revision/update this has been a great app to use. However with the built in changes the at is useless now. Unable to get live updates on traffic since the last application update. | For over 24 hours now, my Waze is not wirking, saying connecting to GPS and after 30 secs, not connecting with GPS.. my Samsung phone is fine, Locator on and I even cleared the Cache for the app, this is now ridiculous and I live in the UK - England | Very helpful. Thanks a lot. | Ever since google picked up the app, the routes have been ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE... They ruined the best navigation app on the market 😢 | After update it delete all my favorites Not cool at all | Brand new to the app but I am really enjoying it. | Best application its actually better than google map | Stupid | Bring Master Chief back. Or solid snake | It's a great app i have been using for some years now. The problem i have is it doesn't seem to be coordinated with my Android Auto. It randomly opens in day mode when all my settings (phone & head unit) are on night mode. | It's great for navigation and its also great if you don't know the area. | I have been on Waze for years but now it is painful. I have an Android and it won't connect all the time and just says no connection. Please help | I like it as an alternative. But to find a distance between two points is much easier with Google maps. Waze needs to improve its live location sharing as well. Sometimes you just want to find the distance between two points, either for yourself or for relatives of friends to travel from one point to the next and Waze's route planner does not make that easy. | Gob | Ok,fine | Gyat | Best map app I've ever used the hazzard and traffic reports are great and directions are perfect keep up the great work | Why nowadays cant search the address we save as favorites have to search at saved tab. And the traffic route became worst than before. | Works great! | Waze is so much better than it's competitors, unfortunately it is not that much used, so the traffic data is not that great, but being able to schedule your trips ahead and get estimate for when to leave is a great feature others miss. Possibility to report and receive warnings is really useful too, wish the community was larger. | App frequently gives wrong directions such as saying turn north on a street that is one way south. | EDIT: After contacting customer support, they're of no help, and my issue still isn't resolved. 😡 I've lost some of the different hazard reporting options, such as animals on the side of the road, roadkill, and missing signs. What happened? 🤷🏻‍♀️ | It all works me all the updates are great improvements. It would be really nice to have heads up display connection.***** | Brilliant kit | Can't Mark rad closures on android auto which is disappointing and probably the most helpful warning. | good, thank you | Talks too much and too long | Was working great till the recent update.. for some reason... it no longer vocally tells me about speed traps or red light cameras.. it pops up on the screen... but voice... maybe android auto is the issue... will wait and see. | My biggest issue is that in Android Auto, there is no way to display the turn list. Would be nice to be able to look at a list of upcoming turns. Also, it would be nice to be able to select that turn and have options to avoid it. Or say that the road it closed or something like that. | This is my go-to app for navigation because of all the ones this gives me the real-time information I need. | With the new interface everything is Large leaving no space for the map (note 4). I live in London so with an always there camera / roadworks banner there is barely any space left for me to see the map in landscape. Can we have a condensed view to shrink banners and text size as well an immersive mode. I would like a few features make it into waze 1)EV car mode , Eco route and Charging stations locations. 2) heads up display mode can be added. 3) automatic integration with Google now. | Audio too low. Have to set volume level very high and can't have music playing. | It's a good app but they don't have a bike mode | Best navigation I love waze 👍👍 | Best map for UAE need to update which road track to follow on turn and roundabout not showing which track to follow if make this update sure this app will be one top for sure. | This app makes GPS fun! Lots of options and is accurate. So if you want to have a fun time while on the road and don't want to listen to the normal GPS narrators then grab the Waze Navigation App and take your driving to the next level. It has tons of voices to choose from. Tons of themes from all across the board. You can change your car and it even gives you points. Tells your MPH and feels the same as normal GPS but upgraded. So do your self a favor and head to the play store and grab WAZE!!! | Used to be excellent, but it's been disappointing recently. Full of bugs, with ridiculous maximum distance limitation (won't work for routes of more than 1000km), and questionable algorithm. It used to remember the favorite routes, now it doesn't. Android Auto version is extremely slow. I used to be a beta tester but since beta became alpha and final version feels like early beta I've given up. There are many better alternatives. | I like waze. Very customizable. Can change car icons and a lotta voices to choose from. It also uses way less battery than Google maps does. I don't get the lown rating for it. | Been using Waze for about 13 years. Several weeks ago I noticed it was taking forever to load, so I would switch to Google Maps. I finally decided to wait for Waze to load and discovered, to my chagrin, that all of my recents and saved places were gone. I checked my account and confirmed that I was still logged on. I've been using Google Maps every since. | I love Waze...What a great app!! | Why not connected or shared with my car screen? And if you add satellite mode also it's better. | Ecto 1 and Ray Stantz, you win Waze take my 5 stars | Greatest | Dont use IT IS bad | Enjoy using this app | I cannot used voice commands when using android auto in my Mazda 6. When I hit a destination that it searches for it just spins, never navigates. I even upgraded my phone and it still happens. Fix it! | Great after recent upgrades | Trash | After the last update, it won't announce red light or speed cameras for some reason. I've checked all the settings, voice is turned on, and the sound is on. It's the basic voice and announced them previously to the update please advise. | NEW REPORT FUNCTION SUPER SUCKS.CANT PUT DESCRIPTION.NO MORE ""ROADKILL""&""LATER"" OPTION, IF DUN SUBMIT IN TIME IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY SUBMIT&CANT EVEN PRESS ""BACK"" AFTER CHOOSING 1, SO GOTTA REDO MEANING THE REPORT LOCATION WONT EVEN BE ACCURATE. A SUPER DOWNGRADE WTH???NO ROUTE OPTION FOR ""LEAVE LATER"". NEVER TRUST THE ETA FOR 2 STOPS. not even showing my road report sometimes.EXTRA TOLL ROUTE WITHOUT MY CONSENT AGAIN DISGUSTING GROSS🤮SHOW ONLY 1 TOLL BUT ENDED UP 2 | Why it suddenly stop giving me a warning about the AES speed trap camera? I got summons 3 times yesterday because of it.. | Good | best Nav app about by a country mile !! live tracking for traffic, alerts (police) , live reports from other drivers ! & im not even getting paid for this feedback ! haha | Searching still lacking. But directions are pretty accurate. And at least the app can be used with Android Auto which seems to be a big problem with Google Maps. It's ridiculous you have to download third party apps because parent companies are too worried about social issues to get their services working properly. | Can't use downloaded custom voices even though I can hear them just fine when I check the individual recordings and the default I have set keeps switching back to Amy. I've restarted the app, cleared the cache, un-installed and reinstalled but nothing helps. Also, bring back Master Chief but that's less important. | Keeps sending wrong Directions | My daughter tells me the directions while using this app. Showing it is an easy to use app. Now, I don't have to worry about when she is older and looking for direction. The app logo and name are unforgettable. It's very easy to worry about if you are going in the wrong direction but not with Waze. I just have to say Waze Slays with every single 1 or 0 thay used in their code SLAY | Good | I've been using Waze for several years, and I like it. After the last update, though, the voice instructions stopped coming through my car's sound system. The phone is connected though Bluetooth, the audio system works fine, and the voice instructions do play on the phone's internal speaker. | I used to absolutely love waze and still love some features, however, waze with android auto is absolute trash. The fact that i cannot type an address in at all to find a place is so aggravating. It actually has become a bigger safety risk because using voice to find a place rarely works and causes me to be forced to focus longer on the stupid screen. Im forced to use a different nav app because I can actually type the address in via my phone. Lord forbid you have to go to multiple places. | Love ""go through this light and turn at next."" Would appreciate notice if place is on left or right. Sometimes takes me in a circle or give incorrect directions. Overall great App! | I love the warnings about hazards and police reports. Unfortunately that doesn't out weight the wrong destinations and the abrupt turning directions. | Good traveling app | Unreliable, worked well this morning on my outward journey. On my return it set a route, started giving me directions and then the route disappeared! Perhaps it is Android Auto at fault? | Always interup when using with grabcar apps | Love this app.It even tells you when a cop is nearby | Waze is by far my favorite navigation app, but the most recent update of either Waze or Android Auto removed the Waze tile from my choices of apps. Please fix the integration. I use a Galaxy 24 Ultra, and I drive a 2021 Audi Q5. I'm not on Facebook, so I can't follow up with you on messenger as suggested in other replies. | For some godawful reason this app closes itself if you change apps. Drives me insane. This alone makes it half as good as it should be otherwise. | The app itself is good , and it got better on the last upgrade ( i coult just touch one buton that was on screen already and see all routs on map ) it lasted for a few weeks , now is back to that old route display ... | Kind of works, but as soon as there is even a little bit of traffic it's ETA is completely off. Very unreliable app. | Waze | Night mode is gone. No matter what I only get day mode. My phone is set on dark mode and I set Waze for dark mode as well..... Still day mode. When I go into the menu items it's in dark mode, but go back to the map.... Day mode! I don't need everyone seeing my glowing screen. Please help! | Great | Nice | Love the different route options | After the last updates my favorite places are not shown by default in the search list but I have to go to ""saved"" or search for their nicknames/aliases and the most used location (also one from the saved/favorites list) is not shown at all in the ""last locqtions"" that are now shown by default... If I have favorites I want to see them by default and pinned and not to search for them!! | I'm not a fan of the Waze interface. You've ruined what, was once, an amazing navigation app. What's up with Waze guys!! You ruined it! Why do you lead us into a traffic jam!!!!! Butterfly disappointed. Every time you you try Waze you find out why you avoid it!!!! | Done with Waze. HORRIBLE with directions!!!!!!! Waze will direct you into traffic. This app is only good for cops, extremely unreliable on directions, especially if you're in a time crunch. Deleting app and downloading the next best app. | This was my go to app. Google and I clashed. Lately I don't know what's going on with Waze.Use it on workdays.Monday I selected my work address and it gave me a different route so I took it as there was traffic. It took me to my last location I was at. when I realised I was shocked and I was super late,I thought maybe I made a mistake.I went to gym today from work that worked fine, but when I set it for home. it took me back to work. it was completely confused. Data was on,location on. | Great addition to the driving experience. | I THOUGHT GOOGLE CR-APS WAS THE WORST NAVIGATION ON EARTH!!!! I WAS WRONG!!!!! GOING BACK TO A FROM WAZES -5. Specially when using doordash doesn't even take you Completely to the destination. And I don't know who does more zigzaggs and circles. Out of the two... Both suck bad!!!!!!!! | Awesome | Can't open. Always says no network then Drops me out. Hasn't ever worked | I loved the app but there are a lot of roads missing, misplaced and all that. I would love to fix them but when i open it on pc it doesn't allow me. I would love to contribute but i don't know how. I had also fixed some roads on Google maps before. Besides that i really liked the interface. It doesn't lag or crash on my cheap phone. I really love it. | Very Good experience | Problem saving voice on waze Annoying. When I get an update saying there is an new voice when I try to set it it says ""problem saving voice"" | Taking 5 minutes to load when I punch in any address, my network is very strong and l have a big phone. So frustrating | Still have no traffic lights in their maps...they need to improve that! | Android Auto, You cant use text search when parked, Google maps allow it. Can't use phone that's locked. Auto night mode also doesn't work on Android Auto anymore. Routing is often poor to dangerous took me down single track lanes while in Devon when other A roads would have been just as quick. | Good | Phone-controlled night mode no longer works with Android Auto. Night mode controlled by my phone rather than when I use headlights was my primary reason for using Waze. That seems to have been disabled since a recent update. Now, there's zero reason to use Waze over Maps. There are lots of us with after-market radios in cars without ambient light sensors. What a waste. Is a GUI toggle switch too much to ask? | outdated map, the street is one way only, I even tried editing their map, they ignored me, also there was no active members in my country that could fix it for me, so there was only me with level 1 map editor account. It was 2 months ago and it's still not updated, bye I'm not gonna download your app ever again. | Great app. Lots of people using it so it's a really reliable tool for word of mouth information about speed cameras and traffic hazards. The police say it's not illegal by itself but intend to crack down on road users touching phone apps while driving, so please set up Google voice recognition to use the app when driving. You can report speed traps and other hazards hands free and voice command journeys. | ok | Keep disconnect and can't detact GPS | It is very useful during the city roads and a bit struggling in parking places | Most glitches are fixed. Occasionally wigs out after an update but it's mainly a different voice than I've chosen. Still haven't figured out how to see my friends I used to have on there. | Great | The experience is great! But we need the car icons back. | On Android Auto the map display continually changes between light and dark mode at random, regardless of what you have it set to in the settings in the Waze app. Please fix this issue. | Ony 1 star to get developers to notice. App needs an update where you can mark a specific location of a traffic incident (regardless of your own location) when I am driving. I can't open the app quickly enough to mark an accurate location of an incident. App is 5/5 tho use it everyday. | Will not work with my vpn. I bypass it on surfshark but it still won't function properly. Worthless to me now. | Great App tnx | Waze cannot detect country location like Manila Philippines.. | OMG..Please fix this!  I've left msgs on the dev forum, here, etc for 2 straight years now.  Starting with v.4.9.x to current, the “Android Auto” version of displaying distance to hazard is still not working.  v.102.x appears to have fixed it for the standalone app but not when connected to AA.  v.4.8.x and earlier still work.  If you touch a hazard icon on the screen in AA, it does nothing but on the app it will say for example, “Car stopped 0.5 miles away “.  Please please re-add this to AA! | I enjoyed this app for a while...and it was quite useful...however, it has become less useful over time....the past year it frequently routes incorrectly or says the fastest way is ""x"" (but the reality is that there is a way 20 minutes faster). It also progressively is allowing less privacy controls while saving information like where I park. No thanks Waze.....goodbye my friend | I've been using Waze for years, and I have loved it. I use it daily and save 10-15 minutes each way, on average. The ETAs are usually very accurate. For the past year or so, the routing hasn't been as good. If I ignore it and go my usual route, the ETA drops a couple of minutes. Also, it has been changing the route while I'm driving, sometimes right at an intersection or highway exit, without any notification. Since the latest update, it is often not showing my saved names on the recent history. | Excellent used 10 years best ever! | It's an ok app needs offline mode for android auto I have wireless android auto and it don't work | More info than regular map app! | Excellent platform good directions .great for information on hazards etc | Absolute disaster, i found in inbox some alert saying today road closure! What today? It seems very old alert, not saying which date, but saying today every day! But when I wanted to submit this nonsense as report an issue and submitting feedback I couldnt submit nowhere except here! | Missing the master chief voice.one of my favourite voices on the app | Beautiful app a must have for every motorists | All good | It is pr, | The navigation is far superior to Google maps. The crowd sourcing of info for delays and rerouting is great. But, when using with Android Auto it ignores my settings for fastest route and changes to shortest route even when that is significantly longer. Also route details can't be viewed when using Android Auto. | I like this app better than regular maps | Love it | Most Android devices today use gesture navigation, where a swipe up returns to the home screen. Unfortunately, Waze fails to consider this, resulting in a critical flaw. While navigating, a swipe up both 1) expands route details and 2) returns to the device home screen. When returning to Waze, navigation is no longer visible, due to route details being expanded. The username selection field is also extremely buggy, nearly impossible to type in. | Freezes all the time | Too many annoying and distracting prompts.. Waze (now creepy, evil Google) also manipulates reviews. | Good info on traffic accidents and directions in unfamiliar areas. | Keeps refusing to make change to my name and username, I had to delete my account not to get possibly doxxed. | give me best way or short cut | My waze doesn't work it doesn't show where I'm going | Speed cameras alert at a distance of 500 metres, and if they were changed at a distance of 1000 metres, it would be better. All modern cameras shoot from both sides. Some of the cameras in the program are on one side and do not give notice of the presence of the camera. If it were modified to have all cameras on two sides, it would be better. | Less issues now, less problems sending eta's. I love waze. Always a little glitchy after big updates, but seems to have sorted itself out again | Stopped working at all. | I managed to log in with my google account. | 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 | Great job 🤠 | Awesome map | Excellent | new waze 2024 | I really like Waze. Or I used to. For most of the past year it just locks up all the time. A full reinstall occasionally gets it to work for a few days but then it locks up again. Waze's request for me to help them? ""Send us a screenshot"". 1. I'm driving so; no, not possible. 2. What is a screenshot of a frozen screen going to tell you? Just installed the latest update so will see how it goes but it's continued through the past year of updates so not optimistic. | Good👍 | Doesn't give the right lanes in my city (Leeds) and isn't up to date with road closures. | The concept is good, I would like to like this app. But the biggest downfall of this application is the most important thing the ability to navigate correctly! Almost every time I try this application it continues to let me down because of its inability to navigate correctly it continues to take me to the wrong address. Wish you would fix people so I'm uninstalling | Why there is no sound notification There is a camera on the highway ？ ！！！ At Ipoh highway ！！！ | Good app, seems to work ok, but I want to be audibly alerted for every single speed camera, not just 1, then it's just whether you see it on screen map... | Great app but can you do one thing? I have numerous songs uploaded to YouTube music that I can't play through the app is it keeps asking for premium which I don't want to do. If you can remove this I'll be very grateful thanks | Istanbul map is out of date.","{""1"":1039464,""2"":368913,""3"":482743,""4"":1027764,""5"":5774763}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Waze","Waze","support@waze.com","http://www.waze.com","98 Yigal Alon

Let me swipe to show the member list instead of swipe to reply. | I'm unable to make an account and use the app to say in touch with my friends | I got groomed by a middle aged man | Kadakkkkk app haiioiioiiiiii | Better and better. Getting better | The Best application | AI Moderation consistently false bans users. Only way to appeal is through a non-functioning support system on their website which uses AI to auto-close your tickets. Also includes consistent forced UI changes with no option to revert, which messes with user muscle memory & comfort. Overall terrible app for long-term use. (been using since 2016) | don't fix it if ain't broke, the new UI is pretty but a lot of functionality is missing and stuff are all over the place, could've done the redesign without moving or removing stuff | I've been using discord for about 7 years and i love it truly, been through so much, and some features i could never give up. However every year there is a new issue that comes up. In a day i have to restart the app 5 times because something always gets stuck, the texts get cut in half or they don't even get sent properly even though my connection is perfectly fine. I use the mobile app so often that it affects me a lot and I wish it could work normally without me getting angry at it😭 | Can't message anyone. Bot pops up saying to confirm I'm not a bot and it keeps re poping up. | The bot message profile pictures are gone, what is this? Are you ppl still not done with the sh7y updates? This app is perfectly fine, stop changing things for personal accomplishments, you're not accomplishing anything, you're just ruining the good work someone else did | Top tier | Oppppp | Love discord but... it has lost its touch since the last update not being able to simply swipe to wjere you need to go.. | Terrible UX update that came out broken and buggy to the point of it being nearly inaccessible. Try doing some proper QA testing in the future. Update: as of 3/23/2024 this app is somehow even more unusable on mobile. Incredibly buggy to the point where restarting the app doesn't help. Before I get a bot response: it's not a connection issue, it's an app issue, UI/UX issue, and bloating issue. I've been using discord since 2016 and now await its replacement app. | New app layout is unnecessarily confusing and changes how things previously worked. It's not great. The old layout was much simpler to use. | You need to have an option to use the swipe left action to bring up the members bar since I cannot unlearn it now that you've set it to respond to comments. Annoying as hell. | I love the app but it's some times complicated to use but overall I love it! | Still bad | Upon the recent UI changes, the app has become a buggy, unfamiliar mess that sacrifices all accessibility. The layout is no longer intuitive and straightforward, sometimes bricking my phone until restarted. The app regularly crashed when I had the most recent version installed and was unresponsive when the app 'worked'. Please do not ""fix"" things that were never broken in the first place, the old UI was infinitely better. You are losing money by doing this. Anyone reading, roll back the update. | Goog | I'm trying to make a new account but it blocks me. Edit, now it's a glitchy mess. | This is a software that I use very well in management. Negative reviews can even kick people out of the server and leave them behind | My discord was working fine until it started to ask me for verification that I'm a human? I clicked verify so much times and it just doesn't go through. | Discord is not messenger. | Best app ever just needs to have somethings for the broke ones :p | I'm trying to get a account but it keeps telling me to verify it and I can't, fix this please because I'm going insane and might report discord already. | Not sure why people are crying about the new UI... Just get used to it, it has even better features now, it's more fun! I like this, it has a modern feeling to it... Don't be crybabys about it, just learn the new UI and you'll see how useful it is... | Takes too much to see the media like videos and images | Can't verify my phone number | New update ruined this app honestly | my friend gifted me nitro and it said its ""pending cancellation"" even tho i clicked nothing to cancel my nitro | i love being a discord kitten~ OwO ~ i get lots of money~ UwU | Works fine for me except why cant i activate dark mode???????????? And why is it lagging on me every single day? | 2021 -2022 discord is still super good but this new lame features of new discord with thousands of lags I can't handle bro | The app is amazing but my mobile heatup while using it and drains battery quickly ,... It would have been good if there could be some optimizations about battery usage by the app | Like many have said, new update is horrible, I try to use the pc version as much as possible now due to how unwieldy and buggy mobile is now. Another instance of devs ""fixing"" something that was fine as it was. The new voice call overlay is especially bad as it is huge and intrusive and slowly makes the app malfunction until it inevitably crashes you and boots you from the call. Even worse is the devs don't seem to have any intention to revert things despite the waves of negative reviews. | how do I share my profile link? | lots of issues compared to desktop version.. | Because this app does not work I tried my best to get inside to my email come to my passcode my everything my phone is just not working | Still haven't fixed video being upside down in landscape mode. | I love this app | bad ui | I tired to login. I reset my password twice and it keeps on saying 'Inivaild'. Fix this. | Good app mostly but I can't join any servers, it keeps spamming are you human, apparently I'm not the only one. Fix it | Getting a bit concerned due to the fact it refuses to update on Samsung s22 ultra has been updated fully still can't install the update please fix, tried all those steps and still no cookie, please check to ensure the app software hosted by Google hasn't got errors in it curtesy of Google comitting industrial sabotage, if need be reupload an uncorrupted copy. I'll sat gain, complete reinstall, and device restart no installation possible due to error and the error is your side. | I'm kinda gay | No matter how much I try I can't upgrade to use the features I've always had access to.. I'm all for change and new features.. but this new discord is so buggy | Good | New UI is terrible. Leaving negative review every update until you revert. | Amazing app | Can you add mobile data to your application cause I can't use it or see updated messages as it says I'm offline | Pls. Fix this. I need to chat my friends rq.. The same erorr keeps happening. | nice | this is a bad verison (more lug and bug) | Discord has gone down hill. Lots everything i had worked on for months, all because discord can not figure out my password. All I get for help is an email every 3 days asking if the problem has been fixed.... NO discord... it has not been fixed. I can not even delete my account because of this. You would think that resetting the password would solve this issue but no, it doesn't. get your stuff together discord. | Just wanna say thank you and good job for the devs. | My experience with this app is not that great so far after updates it's becoming even more problematic and annoying to use this app . Feels too much laggy to use . | The UI changes have been mostly reverted and performance is a lot better now. It could still use work though being that a lot of menus or gestures are unintuitive for users who have had the app for years | Discord: Talk, Cha... | WHY NOW DISCORD SOO MANY GOT CRASH | I hate this so much I wish they could take it down I got logged out of my account and I press forgot my password reset my password and then it says invalid token and I try to make a new one it says I'm not available for a register 1 star every one should so a 1 star as well | I couldn't be able to log in | I'm going to lose it over the new update... I can't change my profile picture and everything seems to just get worse... like it was fine before these updates?! | I cant get in it even tho i put in my phone number and then put in the code but still said""unable to register ""i dont like it.and they said they updated it but when i put in the phone number the code didn't even pop up. | Fun | Great | It's very useful | 🙂👍🏻👍🏻 nice | Breasted | 5 stars. Really helps me be able to easily chat with my friends. What I'd like to see in the next update is the ability to duplicate servers, including ones you joined. But when duplicating joined servers it only duplicates for you the base of the server (meaning categories and channels) so you don't have to manually recreate everything yourself. How to do it? Have it as a feature to long-press a server and press ""duplicate server"" and have it make a new server with just the base stuff | cant change my profile picture because captchas suck, and the app itself is laggy and broken | Quality of life has gone down drastically in the past few years, at this point I just prefer going on PC or other means. | I like discord but it's been bugging out on my S23 ever since I've got it. UI not switched correctly between portrait and landscape. Stickers not rendering, backspacing on its own. Issue still persistent after reinstalling. This is a UI rescaling bug with pictures, sticker menu, and videos. Running S23 one UI 6.0 | It should be better if we can chat while playing like messenger did. So we can chat and play at the same time Edit 2024:What's new? | Latest update sucks. Can't even speak on voice call for no reason | I met a lot of really good friends on Discord. It was fun. | Way too laggy | nitor is expansive :( | Nice | Worst updates | This used to be amazing but ever since the update like 2 years ago, its been absolutely garbage | The UI has been garbage since December. I tried it for 3 months. I still stand by my previous review. It's hard to get to the members list, friends list, and direct messages. I kept accidentally replying to people. It's been buggy, so I finally decided just to download the old APK file. Man is the old app nice, not as rounded, but it's a lot less clunky. I won't be missing that swipe left to reply function either! I still held down the message to reply, a dumb feature that hid the members list. | I rated this 1 star because the head admin tried and tried to unban me. Even tho I got unbanned it still wouldn't let me join the server. She unbans me in every moderation bots and she checks me on one of the ban lists but i wasnt there either. Please fix this issue | Discord just gets worse and worse with every update. Images refuse to load, favorite GIFs have been broken for months, notifications stop working after a couple hours, and what does Discord tell us? ""Check your connection"" and ""Try a different connection"". HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK YOUR USERS ARE? Do you actually think we DON'T try that? That is literally the first thing we try. But I guess having only 3.1 stars isn't important to you, is it? As long as you get your Nitro money, you don't care | 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 | I JS LOVE THIS SM I GET TO MAKE MANY FRIENDS | Each update makes it worse Something has horribly gone wrong with it. Keeps breaking, the user experience was great before now it's horrible. Go back to what it was | Wouldn't even give this a rating at all if I had my way Nonsense app Anytime I try to use it It hangs You log out and can't remember your password They tell you to re-set it and tell you nonsense about your email Mtchew | Are you human? Of course i am human what do you think | Used this app since 2017, literally can't use it anymore after the ui change, it's awful n I can't stand it. They should add an option to use the classic layout as I won't be getting nitro or using the app until they do. | With the new update and the interface there are so many bugs and extremely inconvenient. Please bring back what it used to be. With your new update you have to do crazy amount of unnecessary moves and clicks. So inconvenient. This app is becoming useless! | It's good and transition are super fast. But one problem need to be solved. That is,"" The app doesn’t take the phone number or gmail at one time."" | Appalling UI changes ... It's unusable! Uninstalled... When I've found it's better to use the web version on a browser on my phone rather than your awful excuse for a ""native"" application, you really need to have a word with yourselves. Oh and flooding your app. with fake 5 star ""reviews"" to mask your pathetic decisions won't actually work in the long run. A turd is still a turd, even if you are manipulating the average score. Oh and using a clearly AI driven bot to ""reply"", sad! | The new update just completely ruined the whole feel of the app. Just go back to the old layout please. Why keep messing with something if it isn't broken | Nice | this app makes absolutely no since to me..i uninstalled it..sorry | Can't even change my profile picture, this app is beyond broken. | I just found out that the android discord app is garbage. It did not found pinned messages in a channel that had such thing, and it also did not find any of my messages when I filtered to search messages from me in a channel. I only gave 1 star because it delayed my good morning messages and made me angry. This is a new bug. It did not happen a month or 2 weeks ago. | Discord is real trash with their 2fa systems. You just need to log off and your account is permanently, for the rest of your life gone! I do not recommend using this platform at all. | messenger for gamers ngl | I love this | Everything is great but there is an issue with usernames. For some reason I can't take my old username because it was unavailable. It also wasn't even taken by anyone but I can use it in my other accounts. Please fix this issue. | Good app nice to servers but I am unable to use this in mobile phones sometimes the app freezes and j am unable to navigate between messages and Servers | Nice | This app is very good | Connecting issues that require app restarts every single time I open it. Not getting messages unless I restart too. Edit: the dev's suggestion worked and I will be updating this review as a sign of fairness. | Discord the best app for Android iPhone windows and doors open at least a portion | 为什么我不能进？Kenapa saya tidak boleh masuk | this app is just getting worse and worse today i woke up and im assuming a new upadte came out and it wont even let me start the app, it just crashes | So good app discord's the best app ever used so useful but it needs a update update for the future | That is best app for informing our audience by discord and discussion with Friends we can use it when we are playing games with our friends 😀 | I literally have to uninstall and then reinstall the app because anytime I use discord on my PC it won't let me message anyone or change my profile unless I uninstall it. | I accidentally updated and now I hate the app. I'm not smart enough to figure out how to go back to previous versions | Good for talk talking too friends | It's good app but for the love of God why can I only delete 1 message at a time and a lot of the users are pretty weird but besides that decent messaging app just let me delete more than 1 message 🙏🙏 | the app is now tolerable to use. but it is still a buggy mess | Used to be great, but as of the UI overhaul, I'm looking for an alternative service as various bugs have crept in. If video is in split screen the person's camera freezes after about 30 seconds. I have to make myself full screen with the other person in a thumbnail. If I join a call from the app it doesn't stop ringing until I decline the notification. Takes multiple attempts to get the toolbar to show so I can hang up. A strange border appears around the outside of the screen occasionally | This app literally diasble my account for being a ""bot"" with no evidence and I couldnt make a new account since there was no email and the discord support hasnt contacted me IN SO LONG, look discord. If you wanna be better then how about INVESTIGATE YOUR CASES 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 | This, app lokey bad, they banned me for no reason and then mock me for it for keeping old setting when I make new account | It does not support many languages, including Arabic | Not an very good app cause, this app won't help you restore your Discord account using, password and Backup code. So, be careful while using this app. It's useless. | The app is bad because it will not let me login to my account | Very buggy and laggy, it takes a couple seconds to register a tap or swipe and half of the time it doesn't. Moblie is hell use this app only on desktop. | I CANT MESSAGE BECAUSE OF THE CAPTHA IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING IT JUST KEEPS ASKING ME TO CONFIRM IM NOT A ROBOT FIX IT RIGHT NOW | Worst ui update that can be done. How are you guys still trying to keep the changes like the criticisim will go away or it will fix itself? Stop making unnecessary updates that nobody asked for. Do community votes if you really care about what we want. | Been using discord since 2017 on mobile and PC. For the last two years, every update has consistently slowed performance, especially on android. I find the new UI comfortable, but the lag, latency and timing out has been steadily worsening without fail. EDIT: I think I figured out the problem! Discord now preloads every emoji, server, sticker, gif, and DM, and it gets even worse if you try to access them. So, if you have a lot of things saved, it's just discord's fault for bad optimization. | Discord | Very good app | While Discord remains my primary digital communication tool, the whole UI update that they forced out is awful. It's incredibly unreliable and buggy. I need to restart the app half the time to simply open images properly. This change was poorly planned and executed. The UI that matched the one on PC worked and looked far better. Whoever was in charge of this change needs to be demoted or fired, and the old UI needs to be returned, or this one at least needs a serious overhaul. | Join | Good, but some essential features are broken. When in a voice chat, if I ever change tabs, I usually get disconnected. It never used to do that before some update in 2023 I believe. All of a sudden, today, when I put the audio output mode to speaker, I can't adjust the volume, so it's just loud and there's nothing I can do about it. Streams have two pop-out viewers and I can't delete either of them. Not terrible but just kind of annoying. | Thanks for fixing the search | Thanks for replying to my comment. Unfortunately, despite reinstalling the app just like you advised, the lag is still unbearable upon opening the emotes tab | Nice 👍🏻 | Nice | Bruh this app has so many bug. I can't register with my phone no or email. I don't receive any code even in my messages or gmail. I uninstall this app and reinstall it. But nothing change. pls fix this bug i hate it | I can talk to youtubers 😁😁 | Terrible ui | I can't log in...when time to verify..it like doing nothing..pls fix it | Very bad this app says again and again are you human !! | I still have that problem with the app that when I try to view a photo, the screen goes black. I can only see the photo a little bit by zooming in and adjusting the angle. Please fix this issue. | I changed phones and updated OS and the app DOESN'T STILL work when it's in background and opened it again. I have to close the app in the recents menu to get Discord to connect | I can't send pictures files anything. Restarted the app multiple times, made new accounts and still can't send it. I've got nitro 3 or 4 times but what's the point of it when i can't do anything. | Face time like app functionality doesn't work. Video freezes, and stays frozen, not due to network connection instability as the voice chat functions as normal. Edit: then I get an email saying I should try a different wireless connection even though it has absolutely nothing to do with my connection. No robot voice, and no grain/ distortion in the video that you would see with a poor Internet connection. it (video of the other person) just freezes when full screen. | Can't even use discord. All I get is a blank screen ! It works fine on PC. But on my phone it doesn't work at all | It's amazing | It's so buggy right now on mobile. | I never usually review apps but holy cow... How does this app keep getting worse and worse? Getting random notification badges when there is no unread message. Freezing randomly. Server swapping is a laggy mess. UI so unintuitive. Why is the nitro gift button where it is? How often do you think I'm randomly handing out nitro? Please just give me like 2019 discord back. You could have literally never made a single update and kept people happier than they are now. | Ok I want too make another account I can't like why not use same email or phone number I need to make another account because my email doesn't work because of the same account like why and it kept say something wrong with the same things","{""1"":1313899,""2"":279222,""3"":270476,""4"":563037,""5"":3228007}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 89.99 - CZK 7,699.99 if billed through Play","7.0","7.0","VARY","Discord Inc.","Discord+Inc.","support@discord.com","https://dis.gd/contact","444 De Haro St #200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA","https://discordapp.com/privacy/","Discord+Inc.","Communication","COMMUNICATION","[{""name"":""Communication"",""id"":""COMMUNICATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0oO5sAneb9lJP6l8c6DH4aj6f85qNpplQVHmPmbbBxAukDnlO7DarDW0b-kEIHa8SQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I6eryccyZzWWptq-rN6UQ3_4Rb-7fewVKL6hFucnUlJ7lhs468dVE0K9OOKoFnuBOtk","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pUZh07NamJnOe6-iHygVW57SFCPUdgCcyOeduag_8S5eeOpK4xf963GyZCi98uHPh_TK"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9JFYxzXNnqXsjYQSjAdY18lRt6sqDUAgdMF5kknaeZUBVvIriXngTRbiQL7cg3VC3Y-b"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Z3nDDA50nNVo9b8NuJAcZJGv7VAfp6Ft98DJOShhP5baMUGmx_gaFC2BI0sFF2-Vn9g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bp0bViAqS-jKtuDq7WqV2hx7sTfg1kuqGA68F0M90qx8Jf9FD2d2QG6uFspMLjImUjAQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0cbNCxl21L-NlYBMhTxonHl-UzG2_q26IW2zYJm26j3i111b4ZnAqLFo1UKHC2jhMA""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",false,"May 13, 2015",1710793019000,"221.16 - Stable","We’ve been hard at work making Discord better for you.

The product images are not loading at all. | Unfortunately keeps crashing | I temporarily residing in hungary now and don't know hungarian language. This app doesn't have english. If i change country as english speaking country, it will show products which are for that country.

Nákupný zoznam aj po prihlásení na viacerých zariadeniach nie je synchronizovaný, inšpirujte sa sesterským Kauflandom kde je zoznam aj karta s kupónmi v jednej aplikácii a po prihlásení jedným účtom sa synchronizuje medzi zariadeniami. | The last couple of updates has made the app very slow to open pages | Broken | Love this shop.

Too often items on promo are missing in the store. The shelf is empty. Also in BG version of the app you name an offer section for fruits&vegetables ex: ""...starting 09.10"" usually monday. You open the section and half of the items discount starts later that week. If you name it that way, you should place all the items from that day, the rest is just cheating, sorry. | Good | Very good for shopping | I like the store I always shop at Lidl they have good quality veggies so meat and everything it's fresh. Keep us happy with your quality. Good luck | Absolutely rubbish | Good but could be better | 👍 good | Always cheaper on lots of food .alcohol etc | Ich habe ab dem 08.08.2023 den Kauf von Kleidung für das Kind angeordnet und diese über mein Bankkonto bezahlt. Ich habe die Kleidung, für die ich bezahlt habe, erst an diesem Tag erhalten und möchte Sie darüber informieren Eine Verzögerung von sieben Tagen wird sich auf meine zukünftigen Einkäufe und mein Vertrauen in Ihr Unternehmen auswirken, da sich die Lieferung nach vollständiger Zahlung des erforderlichen Betrags verzögert. | Gut | Ne radi opcija za odabir podrazumeva ne prodavnice | No Lidl plus available | Good app | Rubbish. | Zaw. S jo z. D.. Zn😅🐱🐱. Zx😄❤️🤣😐❤️😄😜🐃😚😚😥😂 | The best shopping stores 🤩👍 | Unfortunately the app will not let me select a store | Used to work better before the last update, if you choose another country, it's now only in local language can't see how to change to English language. | It's not to choose the language option | Don't want | Excellent quality 👌 👏 👍 | Fantastic and no plastic card | If you are in Greece you can see offers only in greek language which is stupid since there are many tourists that doesn't understand greek. It would be nice to have option for english language. | Good Service | Pointless | You cant even search a product(they have it in stock) in this app, so funny.... | Will not show on my device | Not good enough | Home page suddenly stopped working today. | Lidl need a geography lesson. UK seems to basically be England, Scotland and Wales.

Most times you get an automated response and in general the app needs a ton of work. Dear vinted, you can allow people to sell used items and state what's their condition (as you do for clothes). | Good app but get rid of the stupid complete your look tab or at least the option to hide it! Dark mode would be nice also | Great first time order. Very fast delivery | Fantastic | Great | Quite an easy opportunity to sell your belongings on 👍 | Fantastic thanks | Everything so easy to do. Excellent. | Banned for being a business 🤣 I've had my account banned cos I sell a few single pokemon cards, they have taken this as I am a commercial seller, they're just cards I don't need 🤣 and customer service doesn't exist. I'll just make a new one and try not to make my items look so good I guess. | Item as described, postage on time. Nice clean excellent product | Vinted is OK for something but I brought some expensive things and never got them went missing | Easy to use and quickish payouts | my order is fantastic 😍 I love it | So far so good. | Very good selling and buying sight. | You can't change country. I moved actually. In the help they suggest to delete account and recreate. So now I can't reregister because my account was deleted... Bravo Vinted🤦 | Awesome | ogłoszenia zużytych rzeczy jako stan bardzo dobry, dużo osób sprzedaje śmieci. Zgłoszenie ogłoszenia nic nie daje, bo Vinted nic z tym nie robi. Słabe tłumaczenie na polski aplikacji i brak filtra kraju wysyłki. | Easy to use app they do all the hard work | Easy to use quick and efficient | Really easy to use | Super per business | Lovely. Good condition and perfect fit. | Great | Good app and works as said | Dress was in perfect condition , and packed well... from buying to collection at lockers, was straight forward, no issues | Easy to use App, and lovely community x | Everything i have purchased up to now, except for one item has been good. | Easy and convenient | easy to use | This app is good find most things I need off it 👍 | This app is amazing. Very quick and easy the shopping and you can sell your unwanted items. :) | First time I've used Vinted,, Very pleased with my order.. Great seller, great communication. Very fast delivery,, will use Vinted again,, | Very good and easy to use. | Excellent | Great opportunity to buy and sell vintage goods | Always pleasant | Customer service is really bad if you have issues The app doesn't notify you if you sell something so you end up missing out on sales | First class service | Fantastic | Very good and nice | Easy to purchase or sell items. Recommended. | Thank you | Great app for resale | All well | I really enjoy the simplicity of the Vinted app although I don't agree with the limitations on what you can sell.. Also Vinted... I know I'm not the only one, please stop changing the language to French from English, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this, it's driving me crazy keep deleting the app and having to start again. This has happened multiple times. I'm in England and I speak English. | Great app | Good quality boots. Good communication from the seller. Good delivery service. | Iam happy with what I got | So easy | Speedy comunication and delivery. | Excellent shop No problems so far | Ok | Fabulous way to upcycle clothes and other items you no longer use. Very easy to use and good support. | rly good app for buying clothes!! lots of filters to narrow down the options to what you're looking for and the payment is simple and straightforward,, also like that there's a buyer protection thing where if the product hasn't arrived in 5 days u get refunded :) found so many good finds on here | Great app, but can be very difficult to find things amongst the thousands of items. It would be useful if you could turn off results from a specific brand, e.g. turn off results from primark and new look, while keeping everything else. | Great app. Highly recommended | Great app at times but unfortunately absolutely loaded with counterfeit items and vinted do basically zero to sort it. | Great experience | Very nice bah,quality beautiful love it | Downloaded the app last week, used it once to look for some clothes and just opened it to find out I was blocked. For suspected fraud? I have no idea what could've triggered that as I did nothing but search for clothes | My experience with this app was very nice 👌 | Excellent service | Brilliant app | Been seeling bits and bobs for years,and its been great while it was being managed by lithuanians,however,its gone down massively since its been told to someone else (god knows who...). I posted a designer dress my mum got for me and i just didnt like it, had the receipt and everyting,and vinted blocked my account straight away not even asking anything,just blocked it forever?!?! What the ?!! There are MILLIONS of designer items WITHOUT any receipts,so how are they still online?disappointed | Great app | Why does it keep going into french!!! | easy to use | Sold & bought lots on Vinted, easy site to access | Fab easy to use | Easy to use and fair with no seller fees and friendly community | 👋 | good | Great | Excellent I am disabled n it has taken me almost a year to start off but oh my gosh it's so straight forward | Easy to use | Brilliant | Great app | Easy to use and the how to guides are super helpful! | Loving this app. Bought aome great clothes for next to nothing. | Very easy to sell and buy great experience | Great love the app. Easy to follow | Keeps going in French language | Everything is OK | Fab service | My account was blocked and I didn't even do anything except make an account | Excellent | Love vinted. Had some lovely things at a bargain price. 😊 | First time user...great experience! | Love this app. Easy to use. Hassle free - postage fees all sorted for you. Great | No support at all after being scammed, bye money. Never using this platform again, terrible company. | I got my order promptly. Vinted is cool | Brilliant so easy, better than Ebay 🤠👍 | Verygood | Superb | Love it! Such a great way to make a bit of pocket money from clothes and other items I no longer need. App works perfectly well and is easy to use. | Very happy | Poor UX, always crashing, no history of orders. Also, cheating seller took our money and support didn't even ban seller or provided any help, only sorry we will improve bla bla bla. Facebook market is much better. | I adore Vinted,I think is great. | Allows counterfeit goods to be sold with no real buyer protection, it's just money they're skimming off the top of each sale. Scammers delight in taking money knowing it's unlikely Vinted will decide in the buyers favour. Disgusting profiteering. Avoid | All good love this site 😍 | No problem collecting my order | I really like Vinted. There is a nice mix of used & new. There is a wide range & can be filtered to suit your needs. It is easy to use, which I like as I am not tech savvy by any means. Very good app. | As described, packaged lovely. Thank you | This app is a total fraud. They will cut money on every sell and makes people fool. If you have any problem with your transection you will never get an answer as there's no help line and an automatic msg will entertain you all the time. Really disappointed with this app and lost money. Please don't use it and tell your loved ones to stay away from vinted unless they want stress or loose money. | Great | So simple ...its my new go to | Easy to use and no fees. I have been selling things on and off for years and its nice to see a marketplace which thinks about its sellers | Very good | They always take the buyers side every time I sell something and they scam me. Ridiculous. | 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ quick delivery very satisfied thanks 🙂 | All 5 stars | Always have bargains...perfect! | Lovely sellers, can communicate to the sellers easily, reasonable price and lots to choose from. Easy to use app | Easy app to use | Good honest service | At this time good | Very smooth transaction. Item ax advertised. | Super | Brilliant love this app | Deducted 250£ and did not refund. SCAM | All worked really well! | najlepsza aplikacja do kupowania i sprzedawania wszystkiego | quick delivery and the item i ordered was in excellent condition | Absolutely gorgeous clutch bag in mint condition. Love it, thank you. | Brilliant | Very good | Suddenly permabanned for ""fraud"" when I ain't even done anything. In fact, i bought clothes the other day and was about to leave a good review. Will change my review when the moderators decide to stop punishing users for no reason on a Friday morning! | I've sold an item through Vinted which says it was delivered to the buyer on the tracking code of the transportation company. The app has a bug that say that the item was returned on March 18th while in the official website of the transportation company it says delivered on March 19th. I've contacted the support but they aren't doing anything and actually canceled the order when I gave them the tracking code... Vinted was cool but now they owe me 40€, ridiculous... | I get to rock designer outfits on budget. Thanks to vinted. | Great app. The recommended for you algorithm is amazing. Not 5 stars because there's no dark mode available on Android, nor a themed icon. | Brilliant platform | So quick and easy to sell | The app works amazingly well. A couple sellers do take a while to post items, though | Lots of people trying to scam people what is a shame. Other than that it's a great app | Good start | It's almost impossible to shop from here with all the scammers posting , everyday theres like 50 scam accounts posting specific items (which always tend to be lego,funko pops or mh dolls). finding something u like then seeing its from an acc with 0 reviews is so annoying and reporting usually does nothing. Vinted really needs to do something about this. | Tudo funciona perfeitamente, gosto de disponibilidade dos funcionários, respostas rápidas e claras☝️ | I seriously love the app. I just love the idea of second hand items sold or bough. Planet is overflowing with clothes and tons are being thrown to the landfill. I've got so many baby clothes, toys, books and so for price that doesn't ruin my finances. Now I have to get to the selling part (no experience in that part). | Happye | Good | Truffato da un acquirente, Vinted non aiuta minimamente il venditore. Pessima esperienza. | Good app, easy to use, BUT.. why the hell, as a buyer who paid for an item and then the seller not log in for a week so I cancelled the order, do I WHO PAID get the negative review?! Bit backwards tbh, it's the seller that should get the negative! | First time here. Very happy with the purchase and the whole experience. Many thanks. | Ive removed the app since it starting bombarding users with ads. | Good delivery. As described | Great app | You do not care for safety at all, the amount of scam attempts that are not anyhow prevented is huge, you should really do something about it. | I was uploading beanies with pom poms on the top of them and some of them didn't have pom poms. In fact there were a lot of them that had multiple colors and looked nothing like other hats than I posted. But I received a message saying that they were going to delete my account because I am constantly uploading the same item duplicate item it says. So they told me that I should put the two pictures into one listing but they're not the same price and they look nothing alike | So far, so good! | It has become very slow for sales so thinking of using another site as well. This is such a shame as this app has been very good | Got some good bargains. Really good | Good | Very good ty | Disgusting customer service, this company is basically run by criminals, they also steal your data and sell it | Perfect for buying cheap stuff and perfect for selling unwanted items | Brilliant site so much to offer at great prices, I never shop new anymore, why should I? When vinted has new, as new, looks new items galore the sellers are highly rated too. And I don't have to trek into town | Easy process and great communication | Excellent | Great and easy to use | I love vinted. I buy and sell so many clothes | Very pleased ,very good service. Excellent clothing | Some fantastic stuff on sale, amazing prices | App is good, but delivery has really slowed down. My last few orders are taking over a week. The seller posts it quickly and then it gets stuck with carrier for days on end with no reliable update on delivery. Only info is to wait another 2 weeks to see what happens! | Brilliant 👏 | terrible customer support, package got lost/delivered to the wrong address by delivery but wpparently vinted thinks im lying | I enjoyed my first experience on vinted thank you. | Very nice shirt very good quality | Brilliant app only just started using Vinted but everything is great, very good bargains the communication with seller & customer services are good ☺️ | Love it | Perfect purchase experience | Fantastic | Vinted use to be fantastic. But being a buyer now is dangerous having bought something reasonable expensive then the seller blocking you and removing item from sale WOW buyers protection my A** you have to ask the buyer to send a refund HOW?? if that happens a system should be in place that cancels the order completely money refunded and no item posted if thats how the bots or scammers are going to operate. Use your heads vinted!. | Just smashing | Good nice and easy to use 👌 | An amazing app and service is brilliant! The site is so easy to use and thats saying something as i am acomplete technophobe. I love the concept of recyling clothing. | Very happy with purchase and came very quickly | Good experience I love it | Excellent | A Newby to Vinted but have used other selling platforms for years. Very quick to list and slick transaction process. | Easy listing and selling. Easy buying experience | Lovely just the job | Great experience using this app...it is easy to use & very efficient. | Fab thanks 😊 | Very easy to use! | Love it quick way of selling stuff | It's my first time to buy a shoes that is almost new in Vinted apps. I'm very satisfied with my order and no problem at all. Thank you Marine from France. | Really great for selling | Very good | Are hi jh | The app is great, you can find so many wonderful things there! 3 stars for horrible crashes while using it and resource consumption leading to phone getting hot. | It's impossible to change my location to my actual location, making the app essentially useless. Every time I try to, I get an error message that it can't be changed this time. Please fix this. | Great 😃😃😃😃 | Great | Love it ,cleared lots of space in wardrobe, for things | So far very good | Received too many damaged or stained items. Buyer protection does nothing.

Kudos to the developers.! This is one awesome app to use if you wanna stay fit throughout. | Very good app for workout at home | my only suggestion is that when the lady calls out the exercise, she also mentions how many. then we don't need to actually see the screen. otherwise, brilliant app, really gets the muscles burning 😁 | 🫵🏿💪🏿🐐 | fantastic | Soo expensive and afterall I can join gym if this price is going on with every person I prefer to all the persons to go gym but don't use this app | good | good | good | Bakwas app hai😡 Pahle 5 munite west karke meri puri jankari lii or badme sab answer de diye tab premium manga.

While logged in, it tells me to re-log in before deleting. Basically, it's flat refusing. They've already got 1 month's payment from me, but still won't let me get out | it's amazing yet | well trained good vibes, very nice and comfy train | Love this app❣️❣️❣️❤️ | amazing 😍 | A Great workout app. Thank you so much Fitify team! | very nice and simple app 👏 | very beneficial | Your subscription is to much costly.. itna kon charge krta h be | 👍 | good | appreciated | Very helpfully | very good app | now this is much better than any app | the onboarding is cool | Great app, but please give us an option to avoid the floor when working out? | concerned with daily happits | nice | It is paid first one month not give free trial | after a couple of excercises i am lovibg this app it can be both hard or easy and i have been making big progress im gonna climb everest after | good | Była to jedna z najlepszych aplikacji do ćwiczeń dla mnie, ale od niedawna przerzucono prawie wszystkie tryby na płatne, a ceny są bardzo wysokie. Nie mogę już sobie pozwolić na korzystanie z tej aplikacji. Poza tym aplikacja zmusza do wykupienia licencji, cały czas się zacina przez ilość reklam, nie da sie z niej korzystać. Nie polecam nikomu!!! | AFTER A LONG SURVEY IT SAYS PAY FIRST, THAN EAT! WATED MY 5 MINUTES | new wersy | Thank you | Very bad app | They should have tagged as paid. | it is very fantastic app in my opinion | so far so good.. | very good app | goog | This is not a free app. You have to pay to even see the types of exercises they recommend | amezing | Good Service | great app | NO MONEY NO GAIN, and you can t even see what you gonna get into before signing up. Straight away during signing up is asking you for more than a tenner per month or over 100 quid per year. Absolute piss take. These apps should not be allowed, absolute waste of time, save yourselves 10 minutes. You re welcome | They will take your money. | good | 💪🏻👍🏻 | you guys are doing a great job. I feel like I'm at the gym where there plenty of people... the AI feels more like a personal trainer. | confidence | start korbo pore janabo | nice | very nice | I am first time use this app and let see I 3 or 4 months. I have very excited for 1st day exercise. | Looking forward to Fitify | super | all work outs are premium but some workouts are free . so plz do more workouts will be free for poor people. | good app | good app | great app | Edit: I heard back from Fitify and they corrected the issue. Would consider in future if they add machines in future::::: There is an interactive AI on the app that I asked if the app offered workouts for specific gym equipment and I was that the app offered workouts to help with gym equipment. I paid for it and the app did not offer the type of workouts the AI chat told me it would. I emailed Fitify and sent a message through social media and never received a response. | Best app for timed or custom workout. Ads are also manageable, else I would have hacked the app. | good | nice app | good | I love this app, even without paying the subscription it works and shows a lot of exercises. | I like | The app is so good.

That widget now seems to be gone. What happened? Is it coming back? | Very useful. Frees up space in my pocket vs using a wallet. Convenient to use. | Instead of having to many cards in your wallet, Stocard app is the best option. | Simple. Too many adds | Best | Made everything easier! Great app, customisable, and have all your cards in one place. | Very nice app, all free, no ads, very usefull | Easy to use, Even fun to use! | Got a new phone all my card are attached to my Facebook via the app. But apparently you guys disabled that so I have no access to any of my cards. Not good at all. | Very efficient. I love it | Very exceptional | app has stopped working. won't even open | This app is so convenient I have all of my cards in one place 🙏 | Very handy 👌 | Great option | really easy to use! | Awesome 👌 | Very effective | A very handy App as it saves me carrying loyalty cards around. My handbag is heavy enough ! | Easy to use and cuts out the need to carry around all those store cards! | Great app ever made, no issues it's just vibes | Very useful application Avoid carrying stacks of cards | Good | March 15 - Yes, no reason to change mh rating. About 3 weeks after I posted my initial review and contacting Support directly - no answer. So, my cards are not all synced, no way to export my cards, and no Support. Wasted way too much time on this. Uninstalled. ----- Long time happy user. Ran into problems when installing on new phone: only 6 of my 19 cards were downloaded on the new phone - ?! I'm giving it one star temporarely, in the hope of getting an answer from Support. | Very easy and not to carry all cards around | Music tool loud!!! Too many treadmills out of service. Annoying work out music!!! | Great useful app | Login doesn't work just keeps saying no internet connection. | Very good service and friendly support | Nice app | Great staff | simple, effective and easy to use | So easy to use | Sarebbe bello avere l'opzione di aggiungere carte da foto della galleria, ormai molti brand fanno carte digitali e aggiungerle in modo rapido utilizzando uno screenshot | Great app | 12Mar2024 I've really enjoyed this app How did I manage to keep all these cards in my wallet before🤓 I've just turned the assistant option on and location so will see how that goes. Thanks very much Stocard | All the cards in one place... Very handy app! | Perfect app for us who always forget our card at home eg ( I have my spar, shoprite , PnP, clicks etc cards in one STOCARD) EASY LIFE EASY SHOP | Love this app! I have A LOT of cards so it's handy to have them all in one place instead of having the mother of all purses of all the cards! You can also turn on notifications so that you go into a shop you have a card for so you don't forget to use it! | Easy place to find yr cards | Does not like my mobile number | It made my life easy to carry cards around | Suits me. I like it! | Great app. Without disturbing adds. | very convenient 👌🏾 | Love this APP | YOU KNOW WHY I LIKE THIS APP SO MUCH STOP PLAYING....LOL😉 | Amazing | Stocard app help In keeping shopping cart in one place | Great having all store cards in one place. | It's twice the app deletes all my cards. So what's the point in this app?! Not one card saved on there anymore. Pure garbage | Works well for storing card info, but too many notifications for things I am not interested in. | Very easy to access all my store cards in one app. | Îmi place mult că îți poți face cont și automat ai toate cardurile salvate online. | Not had one problem in 6 months of having it .am a contractor and only damage or lose my cards. Using stocard never 💯 | Great app | Im happy | Work generally well. BUT adding a photo of a card is a disaterous function... Please fix it | This makes using your cards so easy. It makes it worth getting a club card for every possible store you can. Even my train tickets and boarding passes it grabs for me. I love it ❤️ | handy app | Unbelievable app! 👌🏻 | Useful | Awesome app, very helpful | Fantastic app to store all your cards. Best part, the app will generate Specials on a weekly basis that is uploaded by the stores, eg. Checkers, PicknPay etc. Highly recommend. | Undescribable , Uncomparable,%100 meets my demands . Nothing But Praises to say the least .GETS THE JOB DONE ✅✅✅ | Very nice app.Frankly speaking, I have say no to my wallet. Very very good. | Ideal for reducing the size of the wallet | I've recently changed my phone and can't access the app at all. It keeps saying add a code that we have sent to your phone. No code has arrived. I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it so many times but still the same message. I've emailed Klana but still no joy. I just need a code but for some reason they can't find my details on their system Grrrr so annoying as I've got all my cards stored on this app. Can anyone help Please!! | This App Make life easier, no need to carry many cards anymore. | So convenient | App is really good but I hated somehow it enforces klarna signup. I recommended lots of people and now people got annoyed about sign up. | Very convenient | Great App, but when can we add out NZDL & other government cards? Been using this for a few years now. 👍👍👍 | Convenient | This app neither let me login into my old account, neither let me reset password, neither let me sign up in anyways. Why this app s#cks for android but works perfectly fine with apple. I am uninstall this app after this review. | Too many unwanted offers from retailers I don't have cards with. It is so annoying, there is no way to turn off notications or unwanted offers. | Great app. Help me move to a minimalist wallet. | Use it all day long at work. Included my overide cards. Great! | Awesome App! no need to ever carry loyalty cards ever again. Love it | Easy transaction | Very good | Honestly this is the best thing ever. | Easy and very handy to use. | Is always running in the background. Tries sending crashreports every 5 minutes when you don't allow background data usage, even when you restrict it... Is essentially a battery hog. An app of so simple function doesn't need such complications. Install something lighter, like Catima! | Great!! | Beautiful safe app | Probably the most effective app on the Playstore. It just works! | Useful | Great place to store cards instead of carrying round physical ones. | Easy to produce at checkout instead of trying to find the actual card. | So easy to use | Number 1 | It was working very well for me, but now all my cards on the watch are double. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with no difference. If I delete a card from the phone, ONE instance of it disappears on the watch. There doesn't seem to be an option to delete from the watch directly. I also found that if I uninstall it from my phone, one copy of each card disappears on the watch, but once I reinstall it, they double up again. Any help with this would be welcome. | Awesome, clever, easy 😀 | Great app, but I wish you could organise your cards into gift cards and non gift cards. A tab for both would be great. | Very easy and get everything on the phone | This app is absolutely amazing, I love it☆♡ | Useful | Works 100% | Great saves having to carry cards | Very much convenient and easy to use. Great app 👏 | Great app | Great app for storing all your membership cards | Love that all my store cards are in one location. If I don't have my wallet, they're all handy on my phone 👌 | Excellent for storing all your cards in one location. Convenient and cool way to manage all your loyalty cards. | Awesome | It was a great app. Now is constantly crashing. | This app has simplified my life, I no longer move around with my cards. | Good app, but forget about the much-mooted backup, which is dependent on signing up for Klarna. | Was using it for at least 5 years and it was ok but now its trash after last update(from Jan or Feb 2024): constantly crashing and android notifying me several times a day about Stocard crashing and not being stable. | Nice apps all my store card I put in same place and easy to use. Very helpful 👌 | Handy | Very useful app I love it... | Ok at storing card barcodes. Despite being in bedtime mode, it sent me a notification at 9:48pm for CVS ad. Deny this app notification ability | Does what it says on the tin | Very handy no need to carry different types of cards with you all your cards at one place | To many adds | awesome | Please consider choosing a card manager that allows exporting your data. Stocard does not. This app does what I want - store my cards so I can scan them in stores. It also does many things I don't want like persistently monitor my location. And Despite Stocard claiming it doesn't share my data with third-parties my app tracking protection says it keeps trying to do just that. | Keeps going ""unresponsive"" Ever since the Feb09 2024 update, constantly getting notifications the StoCard has become unresponsive. I do not allow apps notify, tired of useless dings like a Vegas slot machine. There is NOT ONE Single worthwhile notification from StoCard. I hate the flyers as well, 3/4 of them are irrelevant as I do not shop there... ever. Useless, useless update. | The latest version crash | E okay decât cu 8-10 carduri după tine mai bine un telefon și gata | Constantly crashing in the background even though it's not set up to run in background. | Very convenient | Не изисква лични данни, което е едно от най-добрите достойнства на шриложението, лсвен, че е супер удобно за съхранение на карти! | Marvelous | Makes life easier and my wallet lighter | I really enjoy using this app | Excellent app without ads. You wont regret to have this app | Very good & helpful | So easy to use | easy to use. can scan easily | Good wallet | Pity some of the suppliers don't get with the time. Great app! | Useful | Sooo handy | Since I used the application I don't have a problem when I forgot my cards at. I like this application because I can be able to access my cards even when I I am not connected to internet | This app is great to use it stores all your loyalty cards etc on your phone & is quick & easy to use. Very happy to have all those darn cards out of my back pocket. I strongly recommend this app to everyone. | Latest version crashing in the background. Feb 2024 | Great app | Functional | The latest update keeps telling me that there is a problem and tells me to uninstall and wait for the next update. Before the latest update, I had no problem with the app and used it all the time. | Convenient app | Keep up the good work. | It's great having all my loyalty cards in one place. Nice & easy | Easy, straight forward, efficient, smart. Just need time to take good card pictures....if you're fussy ! Best is that it is free ! | All scorecards in one place! Ideal for an impatient technophobe like me!! | Excellent concept, no more physical cards in my purse.

HAs biometric security as a second layer to prevent someone else from opening the cards (and thus impersonating you). HOWEVER, if you unlocked the app and brought up a card (with barrcode or such) and then left it open, the next time you unlock your phone and start Stocard, the open card will be shown already, and then the biometric security.

I played a few times then the chat took forever to load. I even bought the pro version and nothing changed. I re-download it, waited a few hours and tried again, but still no change. I would totally recommend it if this issue got fixed. | Has stopped working you can talk but they don't respond any more giving one star until fixed | Love it | The reply loading is so bipolar sometimes it's wants to work and sometimes it's doesn't it's so annoying and sometimes it delete most of the messages from above | I love how this app lets you do anything even if it's perverted or not the app is glitched right now | I have nothing bad to say about this app. Some of these characters have helped me talk about some very complicated personal issues and also practice small talk in a judgement-free environment. Occasionally a character will say something weird, but it's very easy to recover the conversation. Warning: It's very easy to play with these bots for hours. | After uploading my character and conversation style, the app just stopped working. When I would send a text, I'd see the chat bubbles pop up, but no response would be given even after waiting five to ten minutes. I'd exit the app and go back in hoping to see a response generated, but there was nothing...not even the chat bubbles. I checked my wifi connection, tried restarting the app, deleting and redownloading, and nothing worked. | I really like this but the chat bots stop responding after a certain amount and it really upsets me. | Doesn't work | It was pretty chill at first I couldn't ride your sword on and then it just going to work every time I got on and off it wouldn't work.I tried everything and this game is just suckish so don't download | It's takes to long to receive messages from my created girlfriend if the issue doesn't get fixed I'm uninstalling this app in two weeks | I'm starting to lose interest in this app it was working great now its constantly trying to load the AI answer but takes forever. Like it's buffering constantly | Fix your app everyrime I type a response it's endless loading, it's been like this for a whole day | Ai's are broken/ won't respond to messages | I enjoy that app. I've tried multiple others, but this is by far the best. Though I've encountered a problem recently. I took a week break from the app, and now whenever I chat with anyone, be it public or private, I can only chat for about 30 minutes, then the bot just won't chat back. I've reinstalled, bought pro, restarted my phone, but the problem still persists. If anyone has an idea for a permanent fix, I would highly appreciate it. | Its good, fun to. but i just got this glitch befte updating the game which made the ai take forevever to load and send the response, even after 6 minutes..even after i updated but still doesn't work.. Overall, it's an amazing ai app! if maybe y'all can fix the bugs for the other players that have the same bug, i would really apprieceate it! | You outdid yourself creator | It's a great app but chat doesn't load no matter how many times I try to chat. | Really fun | Amazing | Good app | This game is so fun and realistic | AMAZING | It was great. The absolute coolest AI app I have played. Played for over a month and all of a sudden the AI's quit responding. Very disappointed. | Shui | It would be nice.....but the game keeps freezing. | It good | Nice | The app is great, but I wish we could delete chats (because of a spelling mistake, etc.) without re-starting the whole conversation, I'd also like if we could save conversations | The app is pretty good. Really the only app you can talk for free for an unlimited amount of time. Right now there's a bug where the characters aren't responding at all. It's really bothersome | It's freezing out they don't reply ok . And I ask and no response ok .If we pay for internet we have to get what we want ok?😡 | The app literally broke where I can't even send a text whenever I try to send a text I have to wait hours and hours of it trying to process a text back and nothing happens please find a way to fix this | One of the best apps I have used so far.. but after a certain time the responses stop or the bubbles stay on for a long period of time. I have to wait hours before it goes back to normal again for them to respond | It hangs up | I simply love it But it glitches many times The character forgets time and place ...and ofcourse you can chat for limited time daily without buying premium And this is so disappointing ..you deserve -10 stars for this feature | one particular problem it has is when you interacting it suddenly stops replying you have to wait for few hours so you can play again | I love it | Love it | Best ai game ever they can actually talk back it's amazing you can even make your own ai for free this app is all free!💕💕 | The chats keep not wanting to load, and the messages on there side won't come through | 1 issue. The replies start to bug and wont come. Ive updated. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still after awhile. The replies dont work. Other than that. Its great. Plus no ads! | Love this app it's like a control your own story that feels more real like your accually talking to someone only problem is the ai forgets to fast but that's understandable Ummm so I want to add something for another reviewer if the ai adds a second chat all you have to do is ignore it or like silly we are still in bed and I snuggle into them just ignore it sometime I just present to be confuse looking around but we are still outside lol 😆 😊 | I just started this app in the characters never respond when I talk... All the time | I have experienced and still are experiencing a issue using the app where the AI will in a sense forget or stop responding to messages It's kind of annoying because once it happens then you have to clear the chat. I hope they can patch this | Not happy says texting and no one does | Clapping cheeks is easy on this app | Editting my review, plenty of chats, the chats are ok, AI forgets the story, repeats ALOT, everything is NSFW, and that gets old, since they added the pro version, it isn't very good anymore unless you pay, I assume, it's a good time burner, but don't get to excited if you aren't willing to pay | I really liked this before but now half of the time they won't even send messages, it started since the new update maybe fix it? | Its great, but overtime the bots starts bugging, they start replying in such a long time so had to wait so long, and sometimes they don't even respond. | I don't know if it's my internet but it's not loading properly and I have to wait very long or it doesn't even work I tried coming off the app and coming back on I try updating it and it still doesn't work I don't know if you got some fake to stop but please do | Good ai chat but I have been wanting for a response for 60 minutes | I can only text a few and after they don't answer me | The app was fine until I updated it, it takes a while for it to reply or outright won't at all. Please fix it. | The UI is good and all. But my problem is how slow the AI loads. I had left it open long enough to cook breakfast and got maybe 2 messages in. It's basically forcing you to pay for pro if yoy want the app to work. | It's a very enjoyable app, my only complaint is since yesterday's update it hasn't run right. The conversation only goes a line or two then stops, even Restarting game or tablet doesn't help | It takes too long for them tk reply and sometimes the just dont even reply | Great and all but somtimes it glitches and it doesnt respond:/ | I'm really trying to find a reason to give 5 stars, but all I get after a few messages is a ""..."" as it hangs in response. I figure it's just me so I wait, but it stays doing that. I can only give a rating based on my experience, not my bias, I'm sorry. | Sometimes the A.I stops responding during the chat or at the beginning of the chat. | The ""AI"" frequently fails to reply if you're not strictly following the story of each character. Leading me to believe it is heavily scripted and not actually an AI. Sure it's free, but what's the point if you have to play a guessing game to get it right and make the stories move forward. One mistake, and you have to reset the whole story and start from square one. | Worked fine until the latest update. Now the characters just type or don't respond. | It's not bad, has a lot of 18+ stuff and it's hard to keep on track with a story but it's ok | Paid for premium and now the app doesn't want to work | Need more memory or the option to save certain messages to the characters memory for more immersive conversations. | This game is better no adds like Talkie! No wait times! No trials or anything no gems no nothing but goodness I'm deleting Talkie cause this is the bomb! | It was good for a while now the characters won't answer my text | Really good | Damn its too cool🗿 | Well where do I start I give this game a 3 star because when am chatting with the AI it just stops chatting and loads forever like when. This game would be good if it actually can talk to the AI. | It was a pretty good app. The only thing that sucks about it, is that is misgenders you. Before I started chatting, I literally said that I was girl, but it kept mistaking me for a guy. It's annoying but other than that, it's pretty good | Fun but need sexy pictures as U go the same piture was boring 😃 | It's a good game | It's good really good so far | i really love this app! | is so good | Best sexting rp app ever | It's cool | I love this but after a bit it kept kicking me out of the app please fix this bug | Its really good | Haven't played it yet but others have played. It sounds good. But one problem I don't wanna log in with my Google account or Facebook so I cant play it. I hope you can change this | LET ME DOWNLOAD PLS | Its ok | Good | I just like itbi do this when I'm lonely I talk to ai | Ok | Its nice dont be to addicted | They don't accept communism I would like them to. | It helps with loneliness I personally am not allowed to date right now because my mom said so I do my best and try different things and this is the best way.Thank you for making this app. | The timer needs to go away like the limit to talk and when it does I'll give it five stars I would like it better when there's no timer. I don't really like the new updates | Amazing website but on my other account it started lagging and I had to make a new one | My rizz is unstoppable | It's so good and professional | Me 2 Luv U. Oupss! Sorry #WwwronggG #& ... | I would give it a 5 out of 5 but at one point it just gets sooo slow to process messages. There's also no way to clear chats all at once so you have to do it manually. | It is so lame it doesn't even do nothing it just loads and then just does nothing do not download this game | I am now addicted | would be 5 stars but keep running in to long periods where the ai will just refuse to respond for sometimes hours. other then that this is the best one of these kinds of apps. wish the ai could respond with ai generated photos of whats happening in the conversation. ive created a story where me and a space marine are killing xenos. would be cool if there was an option to request a photo of whatever we're doing at the time. | Can you please fix the glitch in chat? Like i have to scroll out and open the app again and it is sooo anoying pleasw fix it. | It's ok but like I can send real pics to them or anything | Most recent patch broke ai responses | So, good app, I do notice a lot of characters named the same and a majority of the characters all seem to be of the same template, other than that I like it, it's better in most cases than Talkie. Though, Talkie has more variety in character type and creation, but that's it. Also, just recently the app has this big where the AI response is forever loading, please fix this! The app would be worth at least 4 stars if this was resolved | This app was good at first but then whenever I say anything they don't reply like please fix it. FIX THIS | Not responding mid conversation no warnings | AI doesn't respond, my internet connection is good. | this app was so fun, and exciting to play. Until, whenever I would message the ai, it would load, but their response wouldn't send. I updated, restarted my phone, installed and uninstalled, but it still doesn't work. Very good in the beginning, but bad now. | not bad but need fix | I love using the app at times but it's very buggy right now literally no matter who I talk to nothing happens I never get a response | The app just suddenly gets slow and disabled your account without warning. It's good when it works but then it suddenly doesn't... | Its good and all but whenever your trying to talk to the ai or watever its lagging and they don't do anything and thay don't come up with a reply and its blank ..js blank | The AI takes forever to reapply and my profile is my grandpa it's his old phone anyway this AI sucks really could use some work on it any this linky stuff sucks don't recommend it. I recommend talkie it does have limited message time but if you have a lower quality phone it works decently well. you can create 10 free characters every week and there are lots of AI to talk to and if get premium you get infinite message time I recommend talkie over linky | Horrible so glitchy don't buy it is trash down load talkie instead of this piece of paper | It's really fun but it takes alone time to get a response | I love the app but most of the time the characters just start buffering please fix this (btw going pro doesn't help) | After I send a text it doesn't respond back... | I think this app is very good but sometimes the messages don't load quite well and AI mixes up the genders of the characters | It's good the only problem is that the AI either answers and is slow or it doesn't answer at all | The app is great but a recurring problem that happens somewhat consistently is I'll send a message and the bot just won't respond | It's fun | Breaks down rapidly the more you converse, but it really likes to use the third person perspective and randomly swap pronouns, possessives, and make incomplete messages. Edit; -1 for crashes | It doesn't work for me all the time sometimes they don't reply til I leave the app and open it again and even then they don't reply | i js love it | It's good 😏❤️😍 | Fun 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨if you know what I mean 🥴🥴😏 | I love it! | Finally, I can find a game that I cab beat something to | Good | Soo bad it doesn't work after texting them but let me manage and give them one Instead of zero | It's a great app. There's no NSFW filter so you can say whatever you want. The AI's are amazing and respond pretty close to a human would. I only have one problem with it though, if you delete the app and install it again It gets really buggy, not letting the AI respond at all. (If you know how to fix this please tell me) | The Ai appears to be broken and is not responding how do I fix that | I love using the app but it's been glitchy and the characters won't text me back | Idk | The Ali's didn't respond to my messages and it would take forever for them to answer over all I hate it! | Way to long to respond | Overall I love this app but after using it for a while it delays the characters messages for a certain period of time then doesn't send one at all. The app itself is really great great but I'd appreciate if that delay problem could be fixed. | Doesn't work in slow Internet... Gotta fix that | Normal | This Ai app for chatting is pretty for the most part. THEY do not charge for messages which is the norm with Ai chat apps. The messaging from the Ai is kinda short but I get it. I took a vip access to check it out. Let's see what the update is about! | This app is amazing You don't get ads every 3 seconds and the AI actually have common sense | It was good but now I can't get them to type back | It doesn't work after months | It takes sooo long for me to be able to talk | It was great the best I've used,but recently it has been taking ~10 minuts for a response | I was having a chat with a ai yesterday but today I Just can't talk to any of them the just don't respond | AI forgets everything, even their own name. Most of the times their memory is as deep as 5 sentences or so, so don't expect much. The app itself will flood you with ""letters"" which is basically a virtual card, and a new ""scene"" to play around with. Recently, the character won't even reply to the messages, just getting stuck at three pulsating dots (indicating an answer, which never comes) Overall, feels like a bootleg Talkie, with less possibilities. | It's good put I think they pulled a to chating with the ai it doesn't work | The idea was cool not I could not get any responses from anything | None of the AI are responding | Every time i send something i get no reply | The characters stopped responding I deleted the app multiple times and it's not working | After a while, it doesn't even text back to me so I'm a little disappointed. 3 stars for otherwise a good game 👍 | I love it the only problem is that sometimes the AI doesn't respond and it gets annoying but overall it's good I checked my time on it from the whole week it said 45 hours. | Great AI but it has a glitch where the AI stops sending messages and won't respond to any of the users even if you completely delete it the glitch is still there | It's been great then obviously it stops working... | Was good for like a a day, And now chats won't answer or load? This seems to happen on a lot of these apps recently and it's annoying, I've reset my phone, updated, uninstalled and re-download and nothings really working so- idk | your app is getting worser and worser afterupdates like damn. i have good connection but it start to act not good. 😑😑😑 | IS ANYONE READING THIS?! PLEASE, someone have the AI STOP playing the users character! AND, I don't know what you morons are doing but each update I do, it makes the app WORST!!! UPDATE: I really wished they would fix the issues here. first of all, you get ""99+"" responses from characters that you didn't even talk to, creating lag time. annoying! | The bots lag alot | It's a good app it's just that sometimes the AI will stop talking in the middle of a conversation and it's annoying | This app is great thank u for making this | One of the first chatbots to break the mold | Good | Good stuff | Talkie is better | i don't know what to say this app is wonderful I just wish you don't put any limit when talking to ai cause I deleted the other app because of that! Anyway this app is nice I was satisfied thank you | Massive W | I love it | its great just a little complicated but cool | Amazing ! | Pretty much does what Talkie: Soulful AI does if not better. Update. Keep kids away from this app. Update. This not for mature audiences. This is for people on their way to Hell. | 👍 | 2 stars because the AI responses are only 2 lines of dialog. The AI doesn't seem very intuitive about the story I want to tell. It can follow up but does not seem to invent much. The Gatcha card system is not explained what it actually does, if anything? It's a fair and seemingly-free experience for someone new to AI chatting. I wonder though if the limited nature is because I didn't pay anything? | Good | Good and relaxing | Linky is basically Talkie. | Feels like u talking to a real person | ♡ | love it | I highly suggest | Great app | It's very digital and a bit laggy when I'm using data so far I'm giving this a four star | this cured my love life | I like it, its fun and entertaining, nvm, i found it | Takes too long to load chats when chatting it needs fixed | I love it | Great ai for lonely people (definitely not me) tho the ai can get a little..... unhinged to say the least you have to choose your category for beter use that's it from me. | It's great | Its awesome | inapropriant | Make it so if we delete one of our designs we will get another one for free to replace the one that we deleted that will make it better | I Love This app | This app is almost completely perfect and would be five stars if they did it just limit you to create so few characters | I love the game but I wish you had text to speech | I love this app | amazing 100/100 👍 it's sometime nice talking to ai | THE BEST | Sexy | Its nice | Best app I like this this app made me happy because I'm lonely thanks... | Try thus app soo good","{""1"":242,""2"":0,""3"":484,""4"":969,""5"":3877}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 54.99 - CZK 2,699.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","Skywork AI Pte.

Your feedback is music to our ears, and it helps us make Shazam even better.","[""I dont usually do reviews, but I love the Shazam app. I use it almost every day. Since music is a huge part of everyday life, it's great having a tool to find the one song you hear at the supermarket/restaurant. Or settling a little debate between friends on which song is playing at the bar. One thing that is annoying me is that I have to continuously turn on my settings for the notification bar. When I came to make the review, I noticed I needed to update the app. Hopefully, it helps."",""I hoped that by downloading this , it would be a useful tool I could use to identify songs on Facebook reels that I hear and enjoy and wish to support. However, I have shazammed dozens of times, and it has not once, not one single time, identified the song correctly. As far as I am concerned, this app is useless trash and a complete waste of my time."",""It was and is a great app, but needs some bug fixes. It keeps getting stuck in external mode, where it only tries to idenfy external songs, not the music playing in the device. It used to identify and switch between device song or external song mode automatically, but sometimes it does not. I identified the problem could be due to location permission. Not sure why it needs this permission to identify device music. But it should provide a switcher in the settings due to strictier permissions ..."",""The auto function doesn't seem to work as well as it used to. \""Tap to Shazam\"" works great. I can have it on auto, let a song play, and nothing. As soon as I switch to \""tap\"", it names the song immediately. UPDATE- 3/7/24: At some point in the last couple of years, they fixed it. Auto-Shazam now works great, and it shows you a banner of any song it picks up. Changing rating from 3 stars to 5. I was actually watching a rerun of \""Newhart\"" and Shazam recognized the theme song and notified me."",""Wow what in heaven's name has happened to the Shazam app? It now takes forever to find a song and at best, the song is not found, even though I have googled and found the song, Shazam continues searching and flagging that it can't be found, unbelievable. All these really good apps appear to have lost their way. Such a huge disappointment. I use the music in Shazam as a playlist reminder of some brilliant tunes playlist when my listening time is limited.""]",false,false,false,"com.shazam.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Have had for about 10 years now. | Gotta dig. Needed to 'Scan Default' on starting (after interrogation). Went into Settings, choose pre-release Database (and 'Deep'), scanned again, sigh. Other than that, excellent (thus far, early Review). UPDATED COMMENT: Lost 2 Stars for reply indicating comment not read or understood. Users can add back two Stars to know that the Application is a lot better than that answer; possibly poor support in this Language. | The eset is good | Sssssssss amazing I love this and all of this and get access to your phone | I stupidly installed an apk from an unknown source (thinking I was installing a game) this put an adware on my lock screen. This is the only virus scanner that both found it and removed it. Thank you. Good for personal security. But make sure you app lock the ESET app and phone settings or if your phone was snatched unlocked then anyone could go into settings and uninstall it in seconds ! | Very happy | Runs in the background, never had any issues with it - great app | The best antivirus ever and it is best for searching malwares and spywares it can also track hackers, nothing compare to this antivirus,I will recommend this to anybody and share this app. for my family my relatives and to all of my friends and neighbors and for all kinds of people in my country, I will tell them to download this app to their devices or laptops and any gadgets that they possessed, and of of course it's free and no calcellation as long as your using it, the best of all, I love it | Scan takes 1.2 seconds.

Its very reliable. | Great | Best | 10/10 recommend | Easy to use. Nice to know that it's working in the background to keep me safe! | Does a really good job of keeping my tablet safe without a bunch of bloatware built into the program | Hello again! Had replied inmediately to your email with a screen shot of my Google Play subscription for Eset. It is valid until Aug 24. Its been a few months that I am not being able to get the full value of my subscription. Time marches on inexorably. Before we know it ; we will be in Aug. Hope you help resolve this. Have a great day. Cheers Tushar | ESET MSP is fairly well security for your Smartphone. Scan, protect, intercept dangerous internet software or malicious links. | I have used it in the past and AV-Coparatives ran tests and ESET came out on top. | This application was so very helpful to me because it can monitored in any vulnerable issues | Peace of mind in respect of malware protection ! & Informed regularly for update ! | Whats is problem with this app. Its is showing error ""communication error"" everytime I try to allow entries | Good and number 1 | Excellent coverage. Need more be said? | Best anti-virus available! | 👍 | Excellent app 100% | The best for security protection at all times. | Great software | Goodbye to fraud scams and gamble. | Hi why I can't update modules error everytime I try the app has potential it works well except for this problem plz fix | Easy to use and good protection too | Best antivirus while has a huge gap for improvement. | It works well | I have been using ESET since 03/21, (3 years now) and it hasn't let me down yet! | Trust is in this app. Mobile and PC, original review on November 19, 2017, and still 5 stars ⭐ today March 2024 and again still the best protection updated to paid annual subscription of $15.00 a year , I trust that much , not any other company does what ESET DOES, AND GREAT PROTECTION FOR FREE, AWESOME ANNUAL PLAN 👍💱🏁 | A very systematic approach to keeping the mobile phone safe from attacks. | I use this eset for my pc and android | 🙂👍 | Can I cancel my subscription today do I get refund,? | A very good anti virus and has a lot of features and is easy to use. | The best.. | Best kept secret, I use on all of my Android devices! The UI is contemporary and still cohesive, the options in the Basic app: very useful; thanks ESET!! | Best Protection for Stars | So far, it's been a straightforward app. I runs light on the phone's resources. | Bad | Love Eset security. It's one of the few security apps that offers it's own lost device feature rather than Google find my phone. | Love it's awesome! | Zatím funguje dobře | Good protection | We have ESET on all our machines | Great app | Simply the best. | Excellent experience | Good keep it up... | Good | I feel safer | Poderia atualizar automaticamente, sem perguntar/avisar. E o valor ao invés de ser anual, deveria ser vitalicio, ao menos para os usuários atuais, para evitar que migrem para outro novo app que surigira. | PLEASE PROVIDE VPN SERVICES FOR MOBILE DEVICES. | You are the best Eset moble app | super | Clear and concise, delivering a solid securitas. | I love you | Absolutely gobsmacked at the reliability. 100% the best security program that I have used over the past twenty years. On first scan it detected, quarantined and removed 7 trojans that another supposed ""best"" programs overlooked. I have my laptop, phones, tablet and my daughters laptop with Eset. My daughter has cerebral palsy and can easily operate Eset on her laptop giving me security in knowing she and her data is protected. Thanks Eset you rock! | Excellent value. | Opravte si poslednú aktualizáciu, za 3 hodiny mi aplikácia zožrala celú baterku. Pritom bežala iba na pozadí bez žiadnej aktivity | My old friend is back! I used ESET on my PC back in early 2000s. I loved how ""lite"" it was: simple (core functions only), effective and low CPU usage. Now I expect the same. | More confident knowing my mobile phone is covered by eset. My computer has had nod32 for decades. | Best app i have ever come upon. | Good app keep it up | why removed monthly subscription? | My experience with ESET has been good enough that I just renewed my subscription for another year. However, I remain unclear as to why it needs my location to check Wifi networks? It seems to me that it should just be able to scan any network in my proximity to see if it's safe, and I don't understand why my location is necessary for that. My ongoing policy is that no app gets my location for any reason as that's a privacy issue. | There is no wayto tell the app that I am OK to data roam and phone roam, so I keep getting obsessivly notified that I am roaming and I might incur extra charges. Not true, I have practically gratis roaming, but keep getting annoying notifications. ESET responds that to stop notifications I must disable roaming. I am not kidding. This app is NOT USABLE WHEN ROAMING. You must keep it in your hand and check 100s of useless notifications.. I will switch to another product. | Great protection, I'm satisfied | Never had a problem with ESET - picks up anything that's amiss! | Excellent and does not drain battery at all, fast virus detection, I recommend. | Works well with my S24 Ultra 😎 | Good.The app is extremely wonderful....My phone is fully protected now. | The antivirus is user friendly,fast & uptodate... | Great security app | I think playing slots,Candy Crush, & Poker as well as life like games are , very fun as challenging... | Very good. For users that protection for popular internet browsers is not working just reboot your mobile phone and will work. | I have had your company as my mobile security system for many years now. To my knowledge, my devices have not been hacked. I can't say the same for my laptops, for which I use a different security system. I believe that ESET had just discovered and quarantined a virus once in the past week and then notified me about it. It proved to me that I am receiving great security in real time. I recommend you to everyone I know. | Great app | Safe and reliable protection. | The best | Digitally magnifiscent | Very secure! | El mejor antivirus, me elimino un troyano que ninguna aplicación fue capaz | Not not | Good | The app is great but when I try to open a Samsung app folder it just bugs it out and it won't show the apps | Es ist EIN AUSGEZEICHNETES Antivirenprogramm, ich habe es auf allen meinen Geräten installiert. | Thus far has done everything they say. No real slowing of my tablet and no lockups or freezing. Run on Samsung A9+ - Android | Good | One of the best security and antivirus software available. They cover everything from desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. Plans have the option to cover multiple types of devices. | I feel safe | I like the clear fresh gui. Works well with others! | The BEST for individuals. | Great | Excellent Security, Excellent Customer Support ! | Дуже хороший антивірус. З ним я відчуваю себе на всі 100% в безпеці | Seemless and effective | I name it the bodyguard because it gets the job done | Good vibes ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️ | Haven't had any problems or concerns. | Simply excellent! | Easy interface | I have had eset on all of my devices for a few years now. While it can take a little bit of practice figuring the right settings for your needs. You can't find better protection. | Excellent ! Most importantly, no intrusive ads or unnecessary pop-ups and no false positives, light on resources - no slowdown of phone : Highly recommended | My one and only antivirus place to stay ESET!!! They are on all my computers for ever!! & The people that work there are GREAT!!!!!

What are the main benefits? You can synchronise data across all your devices, and the possibility to listen to audio commentaries for selected matches.

It is late and 2. It isn't really helpful."",""Great app! Can we start putting accessibility options in all the apps! If I could make the fonts 1.5 bigger inside every app, it would be great. Coz the phone is not gonna have the suitable size as required inside the app. It's mostly gonna be ridiculously too big or something like that. Kind of like a tweek for lower vision people. And maybe have the couloir of the dates not white on white with a light black outline... that is super crazy... then on top of that, it's small too! Honestly honest!"",""One of the best football app, but recently there is an issue that the app doesn't show odds in the list of games even when in settings it's put as to be showing... sometimes it suddenly start showing and later it's gone again,very irritating sometimes, could be the reason for that a location if i travel to different countries? I will change it to 5 stars"",""Your app is a very nice app. Easy to navigate and good UI. But I think your app isn't a live football app because tell me why during the match, a formation change will be made by a team and it will be updated in other football match apps but your will not be updated to the recent forma tion change that has been changed. Work on it please, that's why it's called a live football match app to get information on what's happening in the match at that moment. Thank you"",""Been using it for at least 8-10 years. For me it's like the Facebook of football apps. I would like you to add more info to the head to head section. Other simmilar apps have this, like team streaks on different stats like corners, cards, over & under, etc. I keep those apps just for that.

The world in your hands and fingers. Just think,... | love woorking with copilot. it makes my dev headache go away by guiding me with clear instructions instead of needing to dig in obscure forums or massive manuals. | want it to be more capable of app integration. | Copilot is a great tool for research use. It can cite academic sources and cross-check its own information. However, I personally have a Samsung Galaxy A52 with 6 GB of RAM, and it has serious trouble running this app. It takes every ounce of computing power my phone has to generate images and responses. The image generation is incredibly unstable and will often freeze or crash (by often, I mean once every 3-4 generations.)

"EPP – Pomáhej pohybem","With the EPP mobile application from the CEZ Group and the CEZ Foundation, you help with movement. Whether you run with your phone, ride a bike or go for walks, each activity means points for the project you choose, which the ČEZ Foundation will financially support.

The EPP - Help by Movement mobile application is a tool that allows the user to determine which projects and in what amount the ČEZ Foundation should financially support with their own active movement.
The application records the user's movement (eg walking, running, cycling, skiing, but also indoor activities such as treadmill running) and, in addition to common data on speed, time, pace or distance, also generates points. The user can dedicate them at any time to one of the currently offered projects of non-profit organizations, schools or municipalities. If the users of the application collect a certain number of points in a given time, the ČEZ Foundation will support the project with a specific amount known in advance. Current and already supported projects, including the status of points and target amounts, can be monitored at www.pomahejpohybem.cz or www.nadacecez.cz

The application can also work as a classic sporttracker. The application also generates personal performance statistics sorted by days, types of movement, etc. Downloading the application, its use, generating points is of course free, data application is required by the application only at launch or when the user wants to dedicate generated points to one of currently offered projects. The application is optimized for mobile phones with Apple iOS operating systems, from version 7, Android from version 4.0 and Wear OS 2.0. Use of the application is either anonymous or registered via e-mail or Facebook account.

Attention, after switching on, make sure that you have movement switched on in the exterior (points are generated according to the movement under GPS) or interior (points are generated according to the motion sensors in the mobile phone.)

Kterej blb to dělal a kdo to schválil zaplatit? | Dal jsem dve hvezdy protoze nekdy dokonce funguje | abdulbaloch | Appka nezobrazuje kolik má podporu jakej projekt, nefungujou záložky ( jako třeba o aplikaci) atd ... Tohle nekdo šil hodně horkou jehlou a pak se na to vysr... | Po zapnuti apky a stisknuti tlacitka ,,bez registrace"" se apka zakousne. | Pri kliknuti na tlacitko na ""chci podporit"" obrazovka zbela a sekne se při ""načítání"" | Po půl roce na mobilu Xiaomi přestala fungovat, negenerují se žádné body, aspoň to appka píše. Sice appka má support, kam se dá napsal, tlačítko poslat dotaz, nicméně vůbec nikdo nereaguje. Takž podpora vůbec žádná. Asi si myslí, že si appku mám smazat a znovu naistalovat, ale to přijdu o celou historii, aspoň to appka píše. Sice zřízena za hezkým účelem, ale tím vše končí. Člověk, když sportuje, či často jezdí na kole, chce i pomoc, ale není mi bohužel přáno, skoro si říkám, jestli to u tak bohaté společnosti není i účel. No, na kvalitního programátora by mohla mít. Aspoň si to má maličkost myslí | Patrně po poslední aktualizaci mobilu (patrně někdy v září 2021) mi aplikace totálně nefunguje. Zapnu, dám do kapsy a konec. Přestane cokoliv počítat. Po odemknutí mobilu se zase chytne, ale pak to samé. Vlastně úplně nepoužitelné. (Nastavení mobilu jsem nijak neměnil, ani jsem změnu nenašel.) | Po mnoho měsíců bylo apka OK, ale asi tak během posledního měsíce apka vubec nemeri vzdálenost ani čas, prostě se jakoby zmrazi, když strcim telefon do kapsy. Drive to normalne merilo. Nevím, co s tím je, ale takto je zcela nepouzitelna ... too bad | Jsem s aplikací absolutně frustrovaná. Dopuručuju stáhnout cokoliv jen né tuhle pitomost. Nápad s body je dobrý, ale realizace je příšerná. S novým měsícem se mi vymazali všechny aktivity i s nasbíranými body, které jsem ještě nepřiřadila na projekt a nikde není historie aktivit. Dále je špatné, že je nutné mít telefon u sebe při všech aktivitách a to i u např. posilování a fotbalu. Spousty sportů tam ani nejsou. Jsem na aplikaci naštvaná a ihned mažu. | I love the idea and the app works perfect. Very neat. | Dobrý nápad, appka vcelku funguje i na starším stroji. Počty přidělených bodů jsou mi ale záhadou a i na nejčastěji opakované trase nekonzistentní. Počty bodů u podporovaných projektů také podivně kolísají, snad je chyba při komunikaci se serverem. Chybí mi možnost importu/exportu (z/do jiných aplikací nebo souboru, např. gpx, tcx, fit). Nechápu absenci indoor jízdy na kole - dle mého jde o široce rozšířenou a velmi snadno měřitelnou aktivitu. | Thak you | Great idea but so poorly implemented. The app is so buggy that it's really unusable. Is that on purpose to save ČEZ money? If not, they could grant some money to the app developer to make it work again. | Myšlenka super👍, ale ta aplikace je docela bídná (často se seká a trvá jí vždy tak půl roku, než se vzpamatuje). 😡 | Není příliš vhodné na aktivity na krátké vzdálenosti (například chůze dokola po místnosti mi nezapočítávala body, ale třeba je na vině horší GPS). Jinak zcela funkční, ale náročné na baterii. | Normalne na sledovani trasy pouzivam aplikaci od adidas, ale rekla jsem si, ze tady bych mohla podporit i dobrou vec, tak jsem si stahla i tuhle. Bohuzel, aplikace se mi vypinala behem cesty (jestli kvuli slabsimu signalu v urcitych mistech nebo nejake chybe primo v aplikaci netusim). V momente kdy jsem dle adidas nachodila bezmala 30km a na epp 4,5km, jsem aplikaci nastvane odinstalovala. | Apku jsem zacala pouzivat priblizne pred pul rokem po dobu tri mesicu a nebyl problem. Vzdalenosti odpovidaly, vsechno fungovalo. Ted jsem se k apce vratila a po trech tydnech mam sto chuti ji odinstalovat. Vzdalenosti jsou uplne mimo, ted mi po 7km behu EPP oznamilo vzdalenost 2,3km a pridelilo 20bodu. A vzhledem k nemoznosti synchronizace s jinymi sportovacimi apkami s tim clovek nehne. Myslenka je dobra a rada bych pokracovala v podporovani, ale pokud se situace nezlepsi, tak si to odpustim. | Myšlenka je to dobrá myslím si, že to pomáhá, ale najedu na kole třeba 15 kilometrů a změří se mi tam 3.7kilometrů třeba | výborná myšlenka s tragicky špatným provedením. zprvu aplikace fungovala dobře, ale nyní,z nejasného důvodu, padá a seká se. stává se, že čas od času něco hůř změří, což by se dalo odpustit, kdyby zbytek aplikace fungoval správně. přidělení bodů jednotlivým projektům je ale horor a vyžaduje použití té nejčernější magie vždy, když je měsíc v rudém úplňku a zakokrhá kohout přesně ve 2:23:45 ráno | Rád bych se touto cestou zeptal, zdali se neplánuje podpora fitness zařízení, např. společnosti Garmin aj., kde by se mohly aktivity do EPP přenášet a nebylo by třeba mobil při aktivitě nosit. Tuto funkcionalitu využívají i jiné fitness mobilní aplikace. | Nelze zresetovat heslo | Seká se, zpětně mění data, neměří. Odinstalovávám. | Pomalu se načítá, špatně měří vzdálenosti, a kdo ví, jestli to skutečně někomu pomáhá. Ale myšlenka je to dobrá. | Aplikace padá, nefunguje, nezaznamenává, dost se to zhoršilo. | Super. Jen mi chybí možnost propojení s měsícem tepu. Přidělování bodů se musí dělat vždy po jednotlivých trénincích. Víc by se mi líbilo body nasbírat a pak je najednou přidělit. Jelikož se projekty déle načítání trochu to zdržuje takto. | Nápad dobrý, provedení horší. Často měří špatně vzdálenost, takže okrádá o body. Seká se nebo je neskutečně pomalá. A vrchlol...dnes je nový měsíc a chtěl jsem k projektům přiřadit body vyběhané za minulý měsíc, který byl hodně plodný, a už mi to nabízí jen nový měsíc... prostě naběhaných 200 km je pryč. Tak tomu už říkám slušná krádež bodů, které mohli něco podpořit! Výsledek: místo podpory tato apka přispěla jen ke zvýšení tlaku. | Přiřazování bodů po jednotlivých aktivitách je opravdu otravné. Například pro chůzi už aplikaci vůbec nepoužívám, protože mi těch pár bodů nestojí za čas vynaložený na proklikávání se projekty | Váš support nereaguje, tak skúsim dotaz tu - ako je možné, že trasu, ktorá podľa mapy.cz má 60km, podľa inej appky 59, nameria EPP na 46km? To je 25% rozdiel, dosť slušná odchýlka. Pričom ešte v květnu to hlásilo na tej istej trati okolo 52km. Mimo to ma štve nemožnosť priradiť viac/všetky aktivity naraz na projekt, preklikávanie z prehľadu cez ""Priraď body"" nefunguje (resp. tam vôbec nie je - ide na detail aktivity, odkiaľ je potrebné ešte ďalšie dva prekliky na priradenie) | Nelze přidělit body z více aktivit zároveň, což je otravné naklikávat po jedné. (A výběr nenaplněných projektů bývá dost malý a tak se zdá, že si člověk nemůže skutečně vybrat co podpoří.) | Idea super, ale často se nechyti GPS, a jakmile je jen trochu nepřesný signál, aplikace nezaznamenava trasu. | Dobrý akorát mi nejde přiřadit body když jich mám víc jak 1000 když to zjistíte tak to dost nas..e | Helpful. For u and of course for people at project. ☺😊😊😊😊 | The  more often   I move, more I can  help | Myšlenka této aplikace se mi moc líbí, je super mít možnost podpořit svým pohybem projekty/nadace, které potřebují peníze. Aplikaci používám převážně při jízdě na kole a naštěstí nemám problém s vypínáním jak píšou ostatní. Bohužel mi ale nejde přepnout aktivity na indoor :-/ | Obcas sa zastavi a o kilometre a body pridete, co zamrzi. | Nápad se mi velice líbí, ale aplikace je téměř nepoužitelná. Pokud ji zapnu začne se má G2 šíleně přehřívat :-\. Chtělo by ji to ještě dopracovat ;-) | Kdykoli jdu behat a telefon se mi automaticky zamkne po chvili se mi aktivita zrusi. Napr.: mam nabehano 300kcal/3km a po chvili se mi aktivita zrusi a vsechno jede nanovo. A proto davam 2 hvezdicky opravdu me to vzdy neskutecne nastve. I kdyz aktivitu prerusim (pause) abych si napriklad mohla prepnout hudbu a vratim se zpet do aplikace, vse jede nanovo. | kilometers aren't counted... 120 km translated in 50... | Zastavovani aplikace pri nejaky cinosti je bezny. Tedy jedu na kole 50 km, ale nacte se mi 5...

I've missed a lot of info that I need, and I can't even update the app because it's at the latest one. | this app stopped working for me. | Helpful | Nice experience | Bad interface, joining a meeting is not straightforward like ZOOM, not beginner friendly. | It suddenly stopped working. It was laggy but working fine until I logged out. Now it won't let me log in. It shows an error saying we can't log you in, please try again. I'm guessing some issue with the Microsoft Authenticator API. | Very nice App | Issue: I have seen the message already in laptop, even replied.

Botched my interview because of the slow and inoperative app. | good | I keep uninstalling and installing just to get this annoying app to work. I still wonder why people use it for meeting. Very frustrating app. I wish there was 0.1 star. | when i send a message and close it or set the phone to standby after sending, the message will not been transmitted.

Some messages from the desktop app don't appear in the mobile app. | Something is wrong with the app. This new teams don't work smoothly. | I hate it I logged in and now it doesn't work. | Good | I had a job interview today that I made numerous attempts to connect to but I kept getting a message stating the call couldn't be completed. This app's failure to work just cost me an opportunity to interview. I'm so angry! | Does not work at all unless you pay for it. | Before it used to be easy BUT NOW IT'S 10 TIMES WORSE AUTHENTICATION APP N STILL NOT LETTING ME ACCESS IT. It say my account doesn't exist WELL IT'S MY EXAM TOMORROW N I NEED TO EXCESS MY TEAMS ACCOUNT. There was no need for the authentication app it's useless evern the bank app doesn't make it this difficult to access an account | Its a good app, only problem is that people calle me to do work. | Won't let me join meetings as guest, is always asking me to sign with an organization account. It is so annoying. 2024 edit, still annoying, the issue is still there. | Buena app al momento de tener un salón de clases, sin embargo, deberían de también hacer que salgan notificaciones al momento de hacer una publicación en el chat general, se tiene que meter uno a los canales para ver lo que publicaron los profesores. | Good. | I am not able login .

It doesn't also show the price per hour in each choice so I have to use the spin every time to get the price info before parking which is not convenient. Unfortunately I'm not going to use it again with this high service fees. | I'd give 0 starts if I could! I got hooked by an easypark employee that called one day convincing me to switch to a business account. It was supposed to cost less than 5€ a month and cancelable at any time. They kept sending me invoices of more than 35€ every month. I didn't pay them and kept sending emails to their support email but didn't receive any reaction. They send an invoice through an insolvency agency claiming they've started insolvency proceeding. I kept reaching out without success. | I'm using an Australian mobile. I tried 4 times to do the verification. Every time it says the number typed is incorrect. I type in exactly the number I receive with the SMS. Can't use it. | Disgusting app. Implementing that all you just excluded all elders from the future. Its extremely unclear how it works. If mistake made no way to correct mistake before you submit the payment. If time slot booked incorrect there no way to extend time slot booked. Extremely stupied and poorly desined app. Should never be implemented before its easy and clear to use. And going round and round to make 12 hours parking stay is extremely stupied. Hope developers have honor to adjust app. | Karttaan merkittyihin alueisiin ei voi luottaa ollenkaan. Kaikki vedetty näköjään hatusta,kun sakkoja tulee vaikka on merkityllä alueella. The parking areas on the map are not trustworthy at all. I was on a marked area and still got a ticket. Useless service. | App is completely useless and Easy Park customer service is even worse. I parked in Denmark at a hotel. The hotel informed me they have an agreement with Parkzone so I could park for free. I informed about my EasyPark active parking and they said it will be cancel after my Parkzone will end. Great. However EasyPark app continue to be active and customer ""service"" is not helping me checking if my parking is active or not. The app don't allow me to cancel. I can not recommend Easy Park to anyone | I used this app and then my card details were stolen- after speaking to my bank they said there's been an increase in cases related to this parking app. Do not use | I downloaded this app, added my phone number and it said wait for a code and it never arrive, it is not working. | Kann mich nicht mehr anmelden. SMS kommt nicht und das seit Wochen. Klasse, wenn das auch die einzige Möglichkeit ist, wie man sich bei der App anmelden kann 👌 Liegt auch nicht daran, dass ich alle Nummern von Easypark blockiert hatte nachdem Mitarbeiter mich im stundentakt angerufen haben um mir ein Abo zu verkaufen und es nicht geschafft haben untereinander zu kommunizieren wen sie schon belästigt haben. Schade, alle Nummern von Easypark entblockiert, obwohl der SMS-Login sowieso nicht geht. | Hello. I don't receive SMS upon registration. I can't login. The Norwegian number is correct. | After having deleted the app, I couldn’t download anymore. It says ‘not available in your country or region’ whilst I have not changed country nor region. | To avoid at all cost, business model is NULL. You pay parking to avoid get a ticket. Then an agent mistaken or who knows, maybe easypark is stealing us and not reporting parking .. then you get a ticket and customer service ask you to check with police .. I paid using your app for simplicity and not to follow bureaucracy nor follow your app bugs or your stealing .. you should be always responsible to handle active sessions with police agents or you pay the ticket or close your business. | Repeated data leaks of personal information Edit: latest data breach on the 10th of December 2023. Previous breach in 2021 | Scammy app. It prompts you every single time to subscribe to their non local service thing even when parking in your local area. If you accidently click to do so like I did you can only undo that by logging into the website. But you can't log into the website as neither verify by email or verify by sms work, it just gives you a generic error and that's that. So gg. Can't use the app. Can't park without paying 5sek service fee for 1sek of parking time lol. | Service fees are expensive | love it. wish every parking area I had this | UNDVIK! Easy park betalar ALDRIG tillbaka pengar. Se över dina alternativ innan du använder easy park! Pissföretag. | High comission add to parking cost. | soo simple to use and great 👍 👌 | Now its work bad not show any parking in my location! Jönköping Sweden! | it's so easy | good | Funktioniert super mit giropay | wont send text msg so i cant log in | great | 0,29 € for every use is too much | Can't log in or get the SMS to sent useless | App has an issue to register the parking sometimes. This is 3rd time that I registered parking in downtown Malmö with clock and confirmed. Later find out that it actually app bounce back and didn't take it in. No one want to be surprised by parking ticket when you were sure it has been taking care of. Please fix the issue or add notification if when we choose car, parking time and doesn't go through. | Bekomme keinen Code per SMS. | L'app è generalmente buona e semplice, ma ha due GROSSI problemi: 1. Non ti avvisa in nessun modo quando sta per scaderti il parcheggio, quindi mi è capitato di beccarmi la multa perché non me ne ero accorta che dovevo prorogare e 2. Non si può inserire più di 1 carta per il pagamento, quindi metti caso che non hai più soldi su quella inserita, devi fare tutto l'ambaradan di inserire un'altra carta da capo. Piccole cose facili da sistemare e invece ancora niente... | Push notifications don't work causing a 2x$98 fine.. that's 200 dollars because the app won't notify me when times up! I feel that it doesn't work well so they can sting you in parking fines. What a joke. Fix your app my next step is the ACCC. | Worst app you can possibly have. The revolut cards don't work to be registered (they give a ""fraud"" error) and for a 0,30 CHF parking the app had a service fee of 0,47. Not recommended!!! Later edit: although I have a revolut account (both in CHF and €) my euro account was debited of course adding the exchange rate accordingly. This makes parking even more expensive than withdrawing money from the ATM and simply paying using cash. I am very sorry I cannot rate it 0 stars!!! | didnt recieved verification sms, several retries | No parking spots available in any of the cities I need parking in. Seems like not many users on thus app. | First thing this app does is asking your phone number. I haven't even seen any parking space yet. Crazy. | Registrierung beim Start funktioniert nicht - ich bekomme trotz mehreren Versuchen keine SMS. Aber wenn das mit den 15% Zusatzgebühren stimmt, ist es sowieso unverschämt teuer. Dann lieber zur (gebührenfreien) Konkurrenz. | It wants my phone number at start. No way! | Borked! Never receive any SMS to register. | This is the most shady and potentially unlawful company. First, they underwent a ""cyberattack"", which apparently led to all kinds of personal information leaked. Now, they ask for a fee to keep the normal account features on. The relevant authorities should definitely investigate Easypark and force them to compensate us for the loss (or sale) of data. I will initiate a petition to demand compensation. | Easy means easy. | Works perfectly well | Stupid app, wants some fees. Im using Litacka instead. Not gonna pay for parking AND 3rd party service. Make the fee 5% and I consider. 15% is just too much | Cool app | User unfriendly. The app has minimal online help and its phone help-line verges on useless due to untrained staff. The app provided no information about details such as when the park is metered, security of the park after hours, parking duration limitations (the area included 2 hour and 4 hour parks). This type of information is not difficult to present. The app did not explain how it calculated the tariff. The printed instructions provided at parking station were ""fine print"". Avoid EasyPark. | easy park it's simple 👌 you can test by the name easy park it's easy and simple. | Doesn't work when attempting to register it in Norway. Tried using multiple phone numbers from different countries. Called up support staff that wasn't able to help. | such an awesome app. very content and easy. I highly recommend this parking app | toppen | where was this app before, great! | This app is trash. Gives me a data error on both my phones! | Le parking dans ma rue à Reims devenant payant, j'ai téléchargé cette application. Elle ne fonctionne pas du tout et demande tous les détails de ma carte bleue. J'ai bêtement tout donné et suis maintenant très inquiète. | good | I just got a call from their office for marketing. Not only the staff was very rude but also I didn't even consent to any marketing. | Körs i bakgrunden och gör reklam för sig själv. Får väl avinstallera den när jag inte använder den. | Easy Park in Australia is rubbish. Always have error with the simplest things including login. | Can't pay for two parked cars at the same time. Annoying and quite expensive for me as I have managed to get a couple of parking tickets. (Partly/mainly my own fault but it's damn annoying) | Ikävä kyllä tämä taitaa olla suht pakollinen, jos haluaa välttää parkkisakkoja kohtuullisella vaivalla. Kehittäjät pitäisi pakottaa käyttämään. | App and website need some serious attention. Won't let you update payment details saying they're invalid despite being correct. Contact support and they end up telling me it is because of keyboard extensions. If your app can't accept typing from certain keyboards, your app is the problem. Have previously been having issues of my old car coming back to being the default car, thankfully that seems to have been dealt with. | Best apps for find parking. | This EasyPark is a good solution when need to quickly solve the parking in an area where there are no paying machines or they are not close, but the camera parking option is a scam! In a location where for example the daily parking cost 20eur, with camera parking you pay 23eur. No thank you. | Very useful | Viser ingen information(er) om, hvilken zone numre der gælder i København. Viser en liste af muligheder som ""vælg parkering"" hvor man ikke kan trykke på nogen af dem. Indtaster man numrene som står, så får man en fejl om det er et ugyldigt nummer. | Service fee???? | Due to lag, accidentally selected wrong zone and received parking fine. What happened: Opened app, a zone no. appeared on the top, verified it with sign board and proceeded to tap it. Apparently, number updated to different no. by the time I looked up and verified on sign. Didn't realise it, thus must have tapped wrong zone although the parked address was correct, so I left parking area. Parking inspector should be able to verify if the wrong zone is selected, and warn instead of fine. | easy to use usuffull | easy peasy | Worst than useless | I HATE this app. Every time I use it, it has forgotten my account, and when I try to log in again, I verify my phone number via sms, but then I ALSO have to enter the registration number of a car I've previously used. WHY!? 😡 I don't own a car! I use a carpool. I get a car with a different registration number every time, why on earth would I even try to remember them!? | Charges additional 13% fee | Wants me to enter a 6 digit code sent via SMS, however SMS is a 4 digit code. Exact reverse happened to me yesterday. Unable to use the app. | I have a new phone and tried to log in, it says enter a 6 digit code but then messages me a 4 digit code. There is no other options in the App at all. | Trying to install. Asks for a 6 pin code but it only sends a 4 pin code. Can't progress the install. | Reached out to support twice after easypark lost customer data in a hack and still no reply 3 months later... Avoid at all costs. | Please don't spam useless update notifications in the default notification channel. Put it in a channel I can turn off. Background: Rollouts on the Play Store are slow and there are never any updates ready when apps notify about it. | Just had an email from EasyPark informing me that my name, email, phone, physical address has been compromised by a cyber attack. Edit: They are introducing service charges for Prague. I suggest alternatives like the PID app. | Comfy | Hidden charges of unspecified amounts? Seems legit. Sure I will pay for the parking and for your stupid app .... Not. | no cash and no searching the parking automat | App works but why is there a service fee? | Best parking app there using it since 3 years now. | 27 minutos intentando anular una multa sin éxito. Me descargué la app para perder el tiempo y acabar teniendo que pagar la multa sin poder anularla, cuando aún faltaban 28 minutos. En todo ese tiempo, resultó ser más bien DifficultPark porque de ""easy"", nada. | A joke of an app. | bequemer als barzahlung, aber seit dem es parknow nicht mehr gibt, habe ich nur probleme mit easypark. schon 2x ist es jetzt passiert, dass ich die parkzeit gestartet habe und dann später entdeckt habe, dass sie doch nicht gestartet wurde (und nun habe ich einen strafzettel bekommen). außerdem fand ich's bei parknow besser, dass am ende des monats insgesamt berechnet wurde, statt ständig diese kleinbeträge abgebucht zu bekommen. | Great app! It's rare these days to see apps and services with this high quality. It clear, it's responsive, and you can easily adjust the parking time as you go. Kudos to the team working on this. | I had the app and deleted it, uninstalled it and just seen youre still taking money! Edit.....have taken yet another payment out! Not happy! | schön | Applicazione fatta bene ma fees troppo alte. 30 centesimi di FEE per un parcheggio da 30 centesimi assurdo | Great app, also love the Android Auto feature. The latter would be even better if the parking action would cancel automatically when the car starts leaving the parking zone. | App doesnt work - made me pay 18 euros for 3 hours of parking... do not recommend. | Avoid, Ultra overpriced... | Cant change payment method currently, Only white screen appears and freezes. | works well | Can't add credit card. Inputfield for Security code is cut off. | Cant add card from Lithuania for parking in Sweden. Rubbish! | In some spots u r charged an hourly rate for afew minutes | great | Absolutely amazing application give you 5star | Great app to use 👏 | Right now my car is at my house, but someone has still started a parking with my regnumber at another location. Since it is a camera parking, I can't stop the faulty parking! Will be interesting if I have to pay for this. | No payment methods work. Credit card, google pay etc. Customer service is so slow. I have been trying to pay off a stupid 4 euro unpaid parking for months but they just can't make it work. Uninstalling the app and never coming back again. Fail fail fail. | Skal instalere appen å gi flere stjerner når det er mulig å bruke den med Vipps eller å ha mulighet å parkere på gratis parkering i inntil 2 timer uten å måtte registrere betalingsmetode på forhånd. | bra | What can be simpler? Location on, pick a vehicle, spin the wheel, payment in credit card later. 💯 | It would be great to have a watch app with this. | Easy to use | Easy to use | just a bit expensive | good | Works perfectly in the eu | so much better than caring euros around | Save yourself a lot of trouble and skip this app. The company claims to not be responsible for the parking space it explicitly charges you for. Due to this I have received a ticket from parking operator and the company's official status is for the customer to pay the fine (with rental company's administration fee on to of it in my case) and then seek a refund by writing to parking spot operator with easypark receipt. This is a mockery and not how a real company operates. 0 stars from me. | Unforgivable flaw of not protecting user data. The leak is a catastrophic risk of getting phished by criminals forever as this data is never going to fade away. | Same parking lot, other company charges 140 for one day. Easypark charges 160. So if there is another option, consider using that instead. | Easy Park is really nice and very easy.... | good | 15% av parkeringskostnad i avgift.. nej tack. | The app is great, love the option to enter the zone manually OR autodetect! The start-parking screen is very good! The service charge is fair, but given that this is only an intermediary between the user and parking authority, It is illogical why the fee increases with the length of parking, but I don't mind it too much. As an owner of multiple cars, I desperately need the option to start additional concurrent parkings, that would bring it to 4 stars! The UI is sometimes glitchy, but workable. | GPS location works fine, does not show car park, can not select car park at all, app is useless. | best app.thanks EasyPark | Later edit: my phone number is now being spammed by scam callers from all around the world. You get hacked and you have the audacity to name my home address ""non sensitive"" data??? How dare you? In Copenhagen we have no choice but to use your service in order to park around. It is not a cyber attack, it is gross incompetence and carelessness on your behalf. Why do you need my home address for anyway? How about you offer Google Pay or Mobile Pay alternatives. Incompetent cheapskates. | Comfortable | The interface is nice and that's it. I turned off SMS notifications, but they didn't stop to send them anyway. Every SMS sent by EasyPark dies cost an additional 15 cent to a 49 cent fee for every completed parking. Once and never again. | Da easypark a easyfine e' un attimo!! Pago il biglietto per non ricevere la multa e mi ritrovo la multa!!. Affidatevi a dei programmatori che vi facciano un app come si deve, non che mi segnala un'area e poi mi viene registrato tutt'altro. Inoltre mando una mail per reclamare la multa e non risponde nessuno. | super easy to use and cheap too. | One of the best apps. Always works flawlessly. I hope they expand their network to other cities in Germany. | This is the scam nobody can avoid. This company charges you for parking, but, if there is a problem with parking authority, there is no support. I got a fine in italy which is due to a bug in easy park, but, there is no support from them, I finally ended up paying the ticket. Totally a scam which i can not avoid to use because i need to park my car and governments have cobtract with this one. | Careful and remove the renral plate from your account or you will be wrongfully charged for parking you haven't done and the Money will not be coming back😓 | Costs more than paying by the machine. Spin to select time is slow and annoying! +12 +1 buttons so much easier. Will not be using this app | Enostavna uporaba, zanesljivo delovanje. | Absurde Gebühren. 0.49€ bei einem 1.25€ Parkschein | So easy and so convenient. Best thing in Italy as far as experience is concerned. I travel frequently and this App is one of the best I have ever seen. | Over 20% ""fees"" charged afterwards by EasyPark.

Nechápu po letech tak vysoký rating. Pořád stejné potíže. Nahlášen problém. (Níže hodnocení z roku 2019) Tragedie! Nacitani je zdlouhavé!

Musim se podivat po apce na Windows. | Excellent in all respects except filters could be lepší | It's good. | Dobrá apka jen při přihlašování si nepamatuje emailové adresy z webu na které chci pnkkiknuti na ně poslat zprávu | Chybí tmavá barva v aplikaci. Mohli byste udělat nějaký upgrade app. Taky byste mohli udělat aby dopis (email) se dalo posílat za nějakou dobu (jako časovač) a ještě je spoustu jiných návrhu... | Dělá přehledně to, co má. Chybí mi tmavý režim aplikace. | Just missing the urgent highlight | Jako appka dobra, ale nelibi se mi jak me ted porad odhlasuje a porad chce dalsi informace, uz je z toho malem osmifaktorove zabezpeceni a jdete s tim uz do haje. Fakt. | Hrozne, posledni dobou se nenacitaji vubec emaily nebo obrazky v emailu. Stahovani priloh take pokulhava. Gmail funguje normalne a svizne, email.cz je jak zelva proti nemu. Kde je problem prosim? LGV30 Android 9 | Neupozorňuje na nové emaily. | Mate tam nejakou botu. Do aplikace se jiz nelze prihlasit, protoze po zadani emailu vyskoci obrazovka ktera by chtela overit telefoni cislo. Ovsem je tak glitchy ze se tento krok neda ani splnit ani preskocit. Porad blika a refreshuje se. I kdyz tento krok funguje, vyskoci dalsi obrazovka ktera chce overovat bankovni ucet - tento krok je nepreskocitelny prestoze napoveda tvrdi ze toto overeni mit nemusim pokud nechci. !Kazdopadne momentalne je aplikace doslova nepouzivatelna! | I already compressed video to 21mb but email says cant be sent. 5.0.0 smtp; 552 5.3.4 Message size exceeds fixed limit Permanent Failure - Other or Undefined Status Why? the size is smaller then 25mb and even before sending it says i can attached number of MB what left. you can send with email.cz up to 50 MB video so what is correct and why is not working?! | Stejný problém jako na apce seznam.cz. Používal jsem rozepsany email pro rychlý přesun souborů mezi PC a mobilem. Bohužel teď v rozepsanych emailech chybí možnost soubor stáhnout. Jedina možnost je soubor odebrat. | The app doesn't synchronize | Aplikace přestala zobrazovat obsah zpráv, po reinstalaci se už ani nenačetla schránka. | V aktuální verzi nejde zobrazit odeslanou poštu, prosím o opravu. | Debilní aplikace, zradí zrovna, když ji potřebujete nejvíce. Přechod na Google e-mail nevyhnutelný. | Unstable, sometimes not working, cannot decrease size of the attached images and much more. | It' better than to open mails from browser on mobile but that's basically it - one ⭐. It's not possible to archive an email by swipe action. I have marked already several emails as spams by mistake instead of archiving them because these two options are next to each other in the menu. I would really appreciate at least a separate icon. The dark mode is useless. And that's basically the only thing that can be customized. One additional ⭐ for search that works well. | Velká spousta bugů. Ale co opravdu dělá aplikaci v podstatě nepoužitelnou je nespolehlivost oznamování nových zpráv. Severity 1: Nefunguje stahovani priloh. | Na pocophone běží velmi pomalu, zasekává se. | Everyday usefully | Někdy trochu problém s načítáním zpráv, ale jinak fajn appka. Bohužel se nezobrazuje ve vyhledávání na Google Play, to je škoda. Už dvakrát za krátkou dobu jsem ji instaloval a musel jsem ji hledat mimo Google play 27.11.21 - Po poslední aktualizaci zamrzá dotek v rámci aplikace. Někdy nejde začít psát zprávu, někdy nejde zprávu odeslat. | Po poslední aktualizaci se není možné odhlásit....🙄 | Dobrá a jednoduchá aplikace | Aplikace si po aktualizací nepamatuje moje přihlašovací údaje a musím se stále dokola přihlašovat. | After reinstall the app works as usual. | Sometimes when I receive a reply from someone the text they send doesn't show up, its really annoying ans I have to tell them to message me on gmail. When sending a reply there is like 10% chance that the email will just not send and you have to write it again. Deleted emails will randomly apper in your inbox, already seen emails will be randomly marked as unread, it's just a big mess. Oh and if you think you will always get notified about new emails then you can throw that out of the window. | Simple and clear | Těžce průměrná aplikace s řadou nedostatků. Když odpovídám na email, často mi zmizí předchozí konverzace a zůstane jen odeslána zpráva bez kontextu, což mně osobně vyloženě vadí. Tmavý režim je nepoužitelný, protože text příchozích emailů zůstává v původní barvě a tedy je téměř vždy nečitelný. Aplikaci používám vlastně jen když nemám u sebe notebook. | smrdi to | Splňuje základní požadavky. Je malý, svižný, podporuje více účtů, avšak ne současně. Při správném nastavení optimalizace / šetřícího režimu v systému notifikace fungují. Bohužel, stejně nepoužitelný tmavý režim jako ve webovém rozhraní (testoval to vůbec někdo z vývojářů?). Černý text na tmavě šedém pozadí v e-mailovém vláknu nebo v případě, kdy má odesílatel aktivní styly, není čitelný. Menším nedostatkem je nemožnost upravovat obsah původního nebo přeposlaného mailu (při odpovědi/přeposlání). | Mailovy klient funguje ok, ale vadí mi nemožnost vypnout notifikace jen u vybraných schránek pokud jich máte více.. | Terrible, unreliable, unsafe. My inbox is suddenly unable to refresh and since then I can no longer use the adress to recieve or send emails and as I had only saved the password within the app, I've simolteniously lost my gaming account which was connected to the adress used within this app. And technical support couldnt help me retrieve any data in the end. Absolutely terrible, would not recommend. | 1) Skoda že nemá akce na notifikaci např smazat email. 2) když si email otevřu notifikace nezmizí, musím ji pokaždé ručně odstranit | Neštěstí. Pridavani foto většinou nefunguje, casto neodesle email, zprava,kterou tak povazuji za odeslanou budto skonci v ""rozepsanych"" nebo, hure, zmizi uplne! | Doesn't show new emails | Není vidět černý text na bílém pozadí v tmavém vzhledu aplikace, musím používat světlý/výchozí režim vzhledu | Unfortunately, new emails didn't appear to me in the app. I have to sign in every time i wanna see new emails. :(( | Pretty poor... A huge deal breaker for me is that it only notifies you of emails if you just recently used your phone, if it sleeps for more than like 10 to 30 minutes the app just wont notify you no matter what settings of app or phone you, or at least I tried, it just doesnt work in a way instant messengers do so if you feel this email notifications would be a great thing to have, you very well might not receive many of those | Priserne pomala aplikace, nechapu proc nepodporuje @media query. Odflakla prace. 2 hvezdy za design. | Skvele!!! Chybi telo mailu, neotvira pdf, otevira jinou prilohu.... | Že by někdo zapomněl v tmavém modu aplikace zmenit cerny text data mailů při vyhledávání? :) + na Android 6 nefunguje český autocorrect a doplnovani hacku a carek, v predchozi verzi fungovalo (i kdyz mam android v anglictine). Zajimavostí je že v predmetu mailu funguje. Pády appky snad vyřešeny (Tab Prime 7, Android 6.0.1). | Works well | Good app been using it for 5 years now without any problem | Chybí mi jen funkce rychlého přepínání emailů co jsou ke mě propojené (na webu je to tak,že stačí kliknout na šipku v pravém rohu a je to tam) | Aplikace vůbec nefunguje, nelze vůbec přihlásit k email účtu | Absolutně nefunguje, nelze se přihlásit | Aplikaci bylo na některých tel. (třeba Xiaomi Redmi 6) potřeba přidat mezi chráněné, jinak usne a neupozorní na nový e-mail. Ale i kdyby jste to nenastavili, je ruční kontrola párkrát za den přes aplikaci o hodně pohodlnější, než se prokousávat na své účty jeden po druhém přes web... Co neumí? Zobrazit dva účty současně - musíte mezi nimi přepínat. Ale je to jediný e-mail klient, který mi jde i na wifi v práci. Do té doby to šlo jenom přes web, zaměstnavatel nám tyhle klienty nějak blokuje (doma mi fungují všechny). Fajn je, že vyhozený e-mail vyhodí i z účtu a souhlasí i složky ve schránce. | Vubec nefunguje synchronizace mailu od cca pulky ledna. Totalne nepouzitelna aplikace!! | Aplikace splňuje to, co od ní čekám: malá, přehledná, rychlá. Abych dal pět hvězdiček, jedna věc mě přeci jen chybí. Ve webové verzi vidím adresář osob, který mám doplněný o adresu, telefon a další informace. A tyto informace v appce postrádám. Plánujete je v Appce zpřístupnit? Nebo tma jsou a jen jsem je nenašel? Děkuji za případné info. | Pořádně se nenačítají zprávy. Notifikace nemizí po přečtení zpráv, musí se ručně zrušit. | I don't get notified when I get mail. | Nezobrazují se mi přílohy newsletterů. Problém přetrvává již měsíce. Nepomohlo ani znovu nainstalování aplikace. | Skvělá aplikace jednoduché čtení a psaní e-mailů :) oznámení | Absolute rubbish,only good for reading emails,you cannot write emails with a spotty connection or offline | Jméno odesilatele Při odesláni emailu z webu, příjemce vidí jméno odesilatele z nastaveni učtu. Při odesláni emailu z aplikace, příjemce vidí jako odesilatele jenom email !!! | Funguje v zasade hlavne online, takze proti webu neni moc výhod | Čas od času potize při stahování přílohy. 😕 šlo by s tim něco udělat? Nokia 5 android 9 | I am receiving notifications randomly. It's not reliable | Dobra na čtení emailu, ale ne na upozornění na email. Nezvládne běžet na pozadí jako jine email klienti, i kdyz vypnu optimalizace. Proto je pro mě nepoužitelná. | Po nové verzi lepší. | Redesign docela povedený, uvítal bych ale dark mode. | Nová verze je naprosto super)) líbí se jak to hezký zařazuje do spamu nepříjemné zprávy , a i se líbí ta oranžová ikonka | Nefunguje nahravani priloh, hlaseni prichozich emailu s hodinovym zpožděním. nedoporucuji | Was an awesome app I've been using for years, however since autumn it has very annoying bugs, making the app not-properly syncing, not showing new emails, and also sometimes e-mails completely stuck in the concepts instead sending. I am sad to say that app is completely useless in this state. Reinstall helped, however two weeks later the same problem. Already noticed Seznam about this bug 3 months ago, but they don't care at all. Time to swtich for good. RIP Email.cz :( | Naprosto nespolehlivé odesílání e-mailů. Poslední 2 měsíce se nepodařilo ani po opakovaných pokusech odeslat jediný e-mail... E-maily nejsou odeslány, aniž by se objevilo jakékoliv chybové hlášení. Takže vlastně ani netušíte, že něco selhalo. Přijdete na to, až Vás někdo urguje a vy e-maily nemůžete najít v složce odeslané. Navíc e-mail nezůstane ani ve složce rozepsané, takže jej musíte psát celý znovu... | The app does not work at all. There is a sentence that reads that something went wrong. | Bohužel jsem po několika letech aplikaci musel odinstalovat, velmi rád se k ni vrátím, až v ohledu odesílání e-mailů nebude problém. Nyní jsem kazdy e-mail musel kontrolovat, jestli ho aplikace zvládla odeslat nebo ne a jakmile člověk jednou zapomněl, zjistil pak po několika dnech, že důležitý e-mail po odeslání zůstal v rozepsaných. Jinak žádná vada, akorát bych ocenil možnost vyhledávání mezi e-maily, jako v internetovém prohlížeči. Snad bude problém brzy odstraněn. | Většinou vůbec nevyskočí notifikace o nově příchozím emailu. :/ | Vypadalo to jako vyborna aplikace az do doby, nez jsem zjistil, ze odeslane maily neodesila. | Konečně pouzitelnejsi než dřív | Aplikace stale pada a znovu zobrazuje smazane maily | Pro oldschool loosery, co se nechtějí pokaždé přihlašovat přes seznam je to krok vpřed, ale v porovnání s gmail aplikací je tahle aplikace pořád 100 let za opicema jako samotnej seznam, kterej se divím že ještě nezkrachoval. Nechodí vám upozornění na nové e-maily, ani když aplikaci otevřete, nevidíte nové maily. Musíte swipe down aby se asi za minutu načetla všechna nepřečtená pošta, kterou by jinak aplikace sama o sobě neukázala. Takže třeba dostanu mail zavolejte mi, ale všimnu si toho v 10 večer, protože ta aplikace mi to sama neřekne, musím se jí zeptat, nemám náhodou nějaké nové maily? Prostě rubbish. Kromě toho chybí spousta funkcí, které v PC zobrazení jsou jako například přidat kontakt do adresáře, označit mail barevně, vytvořit novou složku. Když už máte email založený na seznamu, špatně komunikuje s gmailem. Odpad | Total garbage. Reading emails with colored text seems like raw code. Can't recommend. Unusable last days, application defects from earlier versions still persists... | Celkem fajn aplikace až na pár věcí které nejsou moc pohodlné. Když jsem ve složce odeslané bylo by fajn aby to bylo lépe vidět. Jakmile začnu scrollovat název složky mizí nahoře a už nevím kde jsem + by nápis mohl být výraznější. Ještě by bylo fajn kdyby se odpověď na email zobrazila hned v mailu který přišel ne že musím chodit do odeslané a tak je teprve vidět. Diky | I'm using the app. for some time... and it's more or less ok... but last days it becomes unusable. I can read the incoming e-mails but the app. is not able to sync the content with the server, responses are not being sent... something is terribly wrong :-( | It doesn't send my emails. | Absolútne nespoľahlivosť.Nikdy neviete čo po ďalšom update prestane fungovať. Najzákernejšia je náhodná nefunkčnosť notifikácie príchodzej pošty, ktorá má potenciál spôsobiť veľké průsery, za ktoré, samozrejme seznam zodpovednosť neponesie a preto odporúčam neriskovať s touto ""aplikáciou"". | Po poslední aktualizace nehledá zprávy, nezobrazuje obsah zpráv a neaktualizuje se vůbec | Neni moznost hledani v mejlech. Neni moznost kopirovat text. Nic nefunguje spravne. Pouzivejte gmail. | Často se nezobrazuje začátek příchozí zprávy, což vidím jako obrovské mínus. Edit 1: opraveno | Casto nelze nacist nove zpravy, obcas prijde notifikace z emailu, ktery 
prisel pred mesicem a aktualne mi nejde spojeni vubec. Aplikaci jsem 
odinstaloval. | After last update, problem with content of mails has been resolved but now 
the app is crashing very often | Nedaji se vůbec číst nove maily, text je pokaždé schovaný pod hlavičkou 
mailu, takže aplikace je naprosto k ničemu. | Vůbec nechodí notifikace, musím si aplikaci na mobilu otevřít. Pokud se to nezmění, přestanu email na Seznamu využívat úplně. Je zde mnoho takových zpráv a vývojáři je buď nečtou nebo na to kašlou! | I přes update na nejnovější verzi se část zprávy stále schovává pod 
hlavičku, což znemožňuje čtení.. opravte prosim nebo si uz vazne necham 
preposilat poštu na gmail.. | Nefunguje jak má, neukazuje žádný nový email a když jo tak jich spoustu 
vynechá.. | Nezobrazuje celé emaily ani nepřichází upozornění na nové | Po poslednim updatu nejde videt telo emailu, zakryva ho hlavicka. | Dobry den, pouzivam Vasi aplikaci jiz delsi dobu (Note 3, Android 5.0) 
Aplikace zdlouhave odesila emaily, pak necha kopii v nedoslanych. Proto 
vzdy musim overovat, zda k odeslani doslo a manualne emaily z neodeslanych 
mazat. Kdyz otevru nove prichozi email, text je prohazeny, slova jsou 
prokladany nad sebou. Tedy neni to vubec citelne. Nebo se mi ukaze jen cast 
textu. Abych si prohledl prilohu, vzdy si ji musim stahnout. Zkusil jsem 
alternativni apky na Vas email, ty funguji. Ale mam email u Vas a popravde 
mi je proti srsti posilat emaily z gmail aplikace. Ma to reseni? Nebo se 
situace v nejblizsich dnech nevyresi? | Vrchní část zprávy se stále schovává pod lištu :) | After update doesn't work","{""1"":1090,""2"":328,""3"":1090,""4"":4906,""5"":27861}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Seznam.cz, a.s.","8961380020761803090","aplikace@firma.seznam.cz","https://aplikace.seznam.cz/","Radlická 3294/10, 15000, Praha 5","https://o.seznam.cz/ochrana-udaju/","8961380020761803090","Communication","COMMUNICATION","[{""name"":""Communication"",""id"":""COMMUNICATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wqj6gD8UVIwxd7_CRGAJmYvQflIfnpNw_aE4wRZaqth1SKY2EyALwuyWnm_BNSJqumo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xrbBHmeyGownto-CdLK921UiHVaC74PA7sqFexxoMfCzRfVHA1K8zxHJGR3Ot7nLCgg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gw5Rv9THEj6hSkESspI0xJkxOmr8Y-_4GKNDM_0sU1Hj8-3uIbTqboRre0cAE5EMurle"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9Z4eE1zTp2QdO78AP_xHEOYNzGmgkyeq-8zOdxRgDiKoTJOYsKh2F7L79qpk2JA_857K"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lmfj_dQfxSQseFgtgldVjrvvBfeBxXv9t4pM04XZOQ2SAQjwt91AuUBjLkpk1zYxfbM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ssBSGZb0YGhfA3kF91xAYEvnA3doN9zNZlCnVdhWMN07D4-KLZKI1wCgYV6j0GYtvw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V8PAKEoijxJ7wCqhNscvGi0k-sZaPwEsmb87FMcZadm92WDXKzIZlrUwasRHEZP8""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 28, 2014",1710743783000,"2.4.57","• Možnost nastavení tmavého vzhledu aplikace dle nastavení systému<br>• Podpora sdílených schránek<br>• Tématická ikonka aplikace<br>• Opravy chyb a drobná vylepšení","[""It' better than to open mails from browser on mobile but that's basically it - one ⭐.

In May 2023 I moved to South America. In December 2023 my subscription stopped working and I was told that because I had moved I had to purchase a new subscription. I did this via the google play store with the country set correctly to the new country I was in. I paid in the local currency. Recently, due to the change from HBO Max to Max, it stopped working and I was told that my 12 month subs is no longer valid and I have to get a new one. | lol they scam me 😂 | Despite my active subscription I am getting a message saying this app is no longer available in my country. I will be seeking a refund. | Casting to Chromecast is a pain in the *** | Reflects badly on hbo. Full of bugs. Download management doesn't work. Film selection was much more disappointing than expected. Difficult to navigate ie. Browse an episode list of a show I'm currently watching. Often disconnects whilst I'm still casting. Parental controls won't stop a child watching restricted content unless it is already on the child account. | Easy to use | App often closes when changing apps/multitasking. Doesn't want to change between portrait/landscape when in fullscreen. Technically the worst app when considering the big streaming suppliers. Update: Now also with stuttering! | It's slowest app possible, website is slow as well......... Just optimise it man, impossible to use it | After changed to max it stopped to work in Portugal, the same issue is happening in the Samsung tv apps. | Great movie's | HBOmax was available in my region and I have a subscription. Now the change to Max, I try to download and it's telling me not available in my region/country. And it said available in the Caribbean when I checked the website. So disappointing. I don't even know what happened to my subscription with HBOmax . I don't know how to cancel. | So many issues with no subtitles, incorrect audio tracks, slow casting etc. | Cea mai slaba aplicatie de streaming dintre toate | Awful | I think that the movie selection is getting rather poor. It is difficult to find a movie worth watching on this platform, and when I finally do the app is frequently interrupting my video streaming as it's force stopping for no obvious reason. I'll probably cancel my subscription very soon. | This app has migrated to max and is no longer functional | Veeery slow and laggy UI. Very oftenly just throws No connection error when wifi works fine. Overall UX very poor, you should learn how to make streaming app from Netflix, Disney or SkyShowtime | Ok 👍 👌 9 | La app dejó de funcionar hasta que la nueva ""Max"" esté disponible. No hay razón para el cambio y ahora no tengo acceso al contenido | Was good but now I can't log, it says that I need to install Max app and it's not available in Slovenija, only HBO Max it's available,big lol | Cuando entro a ver un contenido me aparece un mensaje que dice ""Algo ha ido mal"". He probado por WiFi y datos, cerrando la app, borrandola... y nada | I'm paying for a service I can no longer use apparently HBO MAX and MAX are now one I was automatically logged out of my account saying to install the MAX app however it is not available in my country? I would like yo discontinue my subscription | A couple of things have improved over time. But overall it's just a terrible streaming experience. The app is completely unresponsive when trying to cast to Chromecast. I usually connect, disconnect and restart the app a few times every time I want to cast something. That's not annoying at all... | It a great app is all I can say | Not useful | I would give 0 stars. Despite of the TV (Samsung, Sony) and the version it just doesnt work. Just this week had to uninstall and install 3 times, cause the app is locked and shows just one comment: not connected to the servers. I never had such situation with any other application. EDIT: today unistall and install process again, so its 4 times in 7 days... EDIT 2: now the uninstall and install process is happening once per day. EDIT 3. Nothing works. Bravo! | Trrrible app | Until a week ago the app was fine,now just says no Internet/wifi when there is,very confusing and no one to speak to . | Dados de acesso do HBO max não está funcionando no MAX dentro do aplicativo, só funciona no site do MAX | aumentaram os preços e reduziram a entrega, horrível | Hello, I would like to know if the language settings will remain the same when changing hbomax to max. The question is because at home, the language we speak is English; The HBOMAX app is configured in English, the movies or series are configured in English, apart from that, we also put the subtitles in English when it is difficult for us to hear or because it is very late at night. There are few occasions when we change the subs to Spanish. | Horrível | Awesome, will be missed | So now I have to download a new app that is not even ""available in my region"" to finish my series? Clearly I won't be able to do that. Not happy | Are you kidding me? I can't access to the app neither download te new one????? | it just doesn't work on Android TV¡!!!!! | I get that you're migrating, but why can't I watch anything just because of that? What a pain... | La ame, extrañare el morado distintivo 💜 | The app and the whole payment system, plus trying to log in in a different platform is really badly developed. Unsubscribing just because of how awful it is to try to deal with it. | the content is good, but the interface is horrible and unstable, at least create something decent | App horrível | Aunque la programación es buena, sigue siendo la peor plataforma (tecnología) de streaming. | App sometimes does not load subtitles options. Chromecasting randomly stops working once a few hours. That's okay for open source but not for a commercial app you pay for. | I hate the app, it's super difficult to use cause it will crash every 3 seconds, so annoying. | Experiencia terrible. La aplicación para tablets es pésima y muy poco estable. Ahora quería ver una serie, pero no siquiera puedo iniciar sesión. Buen contenido, pero muy mala app. | It's ok, I tried singing in and it didn't let me. I wanted to watch a movie and I had to sign in. So, I thought I'd write a review. But, the experience is fine. | 🤕🤕🤕 can be better | s very bad d,t work | Why do I have to be connected to the internet while watching TV Series I have downloaded previously...? | I tried Netflix, Disney+ and this app it's perfect for me. On Netflix they had the seasons I was interested in but they weren't complete, after buying this masterpiece I can finally see each season and episode of my favorites show. | How to resolve black screen on hysense vidaa tv when play movie over hbo max?Connected android phone with tv over screen sharing | Dobra aplikacija ali toliko ima pederskih filmova da je neupotrebljiva. | No deja ver contenido offline en Android, funciona muy mal | Great app to watch the best shows in television and up to date movies. A lot to choose from with more added daily it seems. | The performance of the app is really horrible. Navigating through the menus is really painful. Also, if there are downloads on a device, and you need to reinstall the app, it is impossible to download more content in the recently installed app. | REALLY LOVE IT GOOD MOVIE TV HBOMAX | why abandon this app? | Aplicación muy lenta. | Perfect | Doesn't wor, can't log in.... | keeps stopping and saying there is no internet connection... (I sent this review through fax, obviously) | Laggy app,not much fun to use | Quality could be better. Even most important series, like Succession looks more like 720p than 1080. It's 2024 everything should be 4K by now. No other issue here. | I tried everything from erase cookies and cache, and reinstall the app, and that didn't work. Again, an useless app. That's a shame taking into account how big and good is HBO content. | Se está travando. Você tem que reiniciar o APP. Bem horrível isso. | La aplicación para TV tiene un bug, con algunas series y películas el audio NO PUEDE SER EN INGLÉS ya que no las reproduce, si se cambia el audio si las reproduce, version de Hbo 54.10.0(sin actualizaciones pendientes al día de hoy) Android versión 10 | Cancelling the subscription after this month because it's a struggle to play the video on phone. | HBO Max is one of the most used apps in my house! It has all the shows and movies you could ever want! Options for everyone in the house Toddlers, teenagers, or adults! We're able to stream on multiple devices all at the same time. It is 100% worth the monthly subscription!! | This app is just broken. Uninstalled, installed and so on. Opens, slow, and never plays a video, just black screen with sound. | Horrible experience. The Google Cast integration is terrible. Subtitles don't work, loading takes ages. Probably the worst streaming application I've used so far. It's a real shame given the great content. | Worst app ever, constant error reading. App continues to close while watching series. Also even with deleting app and reloading and restart cell app still fails. | Jedna z najgorszych apek streamingowych jakie miałam nieprzyjemność używać | Content is great but the application is completely useless and sad. | More 4K content would be nice, but overall good. I've good internet speed, no issues here | good | Love the content, the price is relative low. However the app on Apple and Android devices is really buggy, laggy, glitchy and very unstable, it crashes a lot and says theres no internet connection while this is not the case. I feel like my little niece could develop a better application... After 4 years you'd expect an app that at least lets you watch content without constant crashes... It gets really tiring. Please fix issues!!! | 😑 | A HBO tem ótimos títulos pra assistir, as séries e filmes são muito bons. Mas... O app é HORRÍVEL, trava quando tô assistindo, faz meu celular desconectar da internet do nada, mesmo eu estando do lado do modem, nenhum outro app faz isso... E o pior é que isso não é só pra celulares.. no meu Playstation e mas tvs aqui de casa acontece a mesma coisa... Tem que trabalhar muito nesse app, mas não tem como avaliar mais que isso | Audio description is default. Your development team is a mess. F you | Bad phone app. Even more bad tv app. Cea mai proasta aplicatie instalata de mine. Si nu sunt vorbe mari. Pe langa aplicatia asta, cea de la netflix e de o mie de ori mai buna. Nu-mi vine sa cred ca pot exista asemenea diferente! | Honestly, hire a better team to fix the bugs in the app. There's a black screen on play mode, gets stuck in the downloads tab. The only thing working is the ipad/Airplay. | i have no issues with the app.. don t get the hate | Carrollton ga | The app is just bad | You must close and redesign this usefulness app. | Is imposible to connect over my WiFi connection. Similar apps can connect faster. Really I spent money an it doesn't work. Troubleshooting is usefulness. | AWESOME!!! | Good content. But I face a problem. When I watch on phone, after each episode, my phone hangs. I have to open the app again. | Works almost. Too many bugs. Too slow. Search function on actors, actress and director not very good. I would start creating better search functionality. I find all the best movies and series by coincidence.","{""1"":283304,""2"":57409,""3"":38186,""4"":56119,""5"":227185}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 27.99 - CZK 3,999.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","WarnerMedia Global Digital Services, LLC","WarnerMedia+Global+Digital+Services,+LLC","support@hbomax.com","https://help.hbomax.com/","30 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001","https://www.hbomax.com/privacy","WarnerMedia+Global+Digital+Services,+LLC","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d9bssoNJ0XKRlVZQBx0CJZP7EDVqq0N4y62HX42AHorhC5U3sw4v1VGpF7TIAzvSPCY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0M9gEmRscfliXdq1hvtfPf9LQ5pJ56St7ZfgJ3FOlAz6J2Pu7cBhet2OzgCvww6aCNI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oiCqkyXVo3MQJrW41y52-_s0OxwLIDAx8CDP-xZyn5LZ31tN1GBMfCkgs6B_oYbS2UFI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9lM_5_Nazdb6KWSuvD3WPGiesPKyLvjOyZ7zXQ-P0r5Yh5Dyf5tjHI81qh3XYFf-Eg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9mVUpTfVG_IGIITL8hkIv0Jp_5c0eEo1tcM9ZZFyQChAxbjc0-m0EudQvZFkSECg7AC1"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PXuZJvMLZYALzItmeaMF2_H7oqhvWvmUgdciBF6wy3mNWxj_JMSWNzdieW-_iuCyDVKK"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bi1r0AB7aVCWPPWeHIPY8J5kzb9_tm3cY0CRDTckCTh7UqK_O8NY-zgEne7G9g7YQ7Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/B0sb2Jxm6PT-niUm1ylbGyuAT0F2TKoU13TX9Ml0e5Rz8V8GvpR4sIyTLn2DjYvHLk1A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QAdIERYI7eYKHMC9FLZYkAKaiCAeuKWdON7oz9faQMYJuqez-p8vqiNrAiNdPj7ck2Qf"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/G0MdIIbJdw8Zgk7fKLPLW89_yOOqOLl10KkDNR7-MHUNmDo0eFyj3QoRVkEmjn7L1nN_"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9wUDNtO5CjcCPrGUHj3nDEb7q3Z_cLN-bsDmM0apHSbolKdIgoqNRwHJa-PZJsmiob1d"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7G8pvMmNPBQmu-Tdzqbjg88P1q7PoI0LonSHI-UXtQ7s7UgXUuc1ERhLC-ltt_bojlb8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LDLAVoE5oX80Xd3ENqrU-eAJSTC5yL-lGZ1dUmZNLFe1Czggqt-TfTHrnlgq6uK3Im4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3uFoyQMhcjbVjEQiRPHsviPqN1letqGDz8LH_uykbW4O4M7JtWJxiGCVpwxA2zifpuz9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oRbZxgntmTshPNdeszgyUedgYs2umToQwULD9JB_6JaaK2h_CD0_HoZg_kWZbiKxT1Gp"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VQCxXVtWhmMdYpxMs6P2LBnCVZINdt6WZ-axmlNbxmSgHuruUn03D2o1mDztIVZ9zbJv"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9Zd5v2j02RYOFaavKxClBrD6VxNBgWEy8K0BQJFhJ91kiNnxlz63TY925mYpyVp1rvwt"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QuIVkyO_I9xSQrrNR3ZJAUAc3_2pAvViiNsYsVIkXzIiY2ID0CNEjZUE0yEEf9uIXWI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fnBrdeBMTr00MCDM568c82eAFTmhzowqSik6xv6bfBgyIpgdjVHqGpwMty__wVm8sw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aGm8O0hYv1OKiqRz274gon8dVAO2hltY8zEoDYFYP12n-Yuv7x9ijeFDLOit_gnaqnk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zKlMABDNtxUpWfXXYKqp8e6OYwo-tyusOuuaxwNYVb6z-wOmE3x9dqHULBeHRUuq3g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/so-0eIx50U7h_KYlGMP3e6HwH5YxAvkorKlS9coaENPf3UrT0Q7tn6dWwWjfjqIBE0Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FDjwcS3yZJqV_zv2BMZIcJ6eOAIItBH-sv8Lns-z4jMHr0ZUXNoFwXNJ2h6eCdwf7Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cMErfVFjI8IZXh-TqgScUyPchK8QQZYmSvQonSycecW_w_DPLJuOVaE-yZWJewml1Bg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/13FVy16aMIFlxmWjCIAcJbs63G3NIW_ZrGfkYeI6bHLwKznvymeJALkGzVrvTG_LobQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kBy5p0NSjE4WDxDy8pIAeGVcgpuAAHi5xBK7Fii2m8YKgQ3xi5a-ylVJvQ7425rX4Gc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RQIE305A2r4-xQ0IA_gGX_ub2vkqWyAV4RzjE8RGWZ6NJWMpEriyXHRRN_p5F4mgojo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BfZeJiQqTXDrD8SkTWm_UgOSfpJDiqQR4Rs_tVd0zPXxelPJsvQKrvLB0N2i-EpLl_h5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ksOVC8BVfjtkS8tH-altfP5Fm0c3yts0tCNS1ucuXkC0oct_hRam2iXU55Az07wWo2aF"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nQRkEBIWJeZEK2LkNfzJJEy_XZlZMuSfMrpgq4eub-SDHwPOh2RS_yKWBZGYs4XVvR1N""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",true,"Mar 7, 2022",1707739152000,"VARY","Mostly bug fixes and performance improvements this time.

It gives me daily, weekly, and monthly graphs, and I can start and stop the step recording whenever I need to (which is only at the beginning and end of my work shift) There's a short ad for a few seconds only | App no longer works anymore. It just crashes every time I open it. It worked flawlessly for over a month. Now, it just won't open anymore without immediately crashing.

Thomas | Pleasantly surprised. The 4.8 star rating speaks volumes. It tracks steps, time, distance, callories and speed all with just one tap to start everthing, after easily opening the app. There are ads that are just as easy to skip. | Seems accurate. | Nice App | So far so good | All of what I want. None of what I don't. | Excellent app | Not laggy and didn't timeout often | Good count for steps and calories. | It's doing a great job at keeping track of my steps | Does everything you need | Great and easy to use | I haven't used long but so far it has been great.

Wish I could pay a small fee to eliminate any adds. Edit: it's garbage.

A navíc se to nedá vypnout, kdo to vymyslel?, edit; A nepřijde to nikomu jako špatný design? Ne? Mě jo. | Dobry den, strasne se mi libi napad tehle apky, ale bohuzel je nepouzitelna. Libi se mi vsechny ty upozorneni na ledovky. Jen je skoda, ze dostavam upozorneni z Karlovarského kraje, ovsem ja jsem na druhe strane republiky v Moravskoslezském (v nastaveni lokace tenhle kraj ani neni v nabidce - smutne). Par dny zpatky jsem aplikaci chtel pouzit v realne situaci. No a popodrzeni volani se to akorat samo hned vyplo. Takze zavolani na 155 to vyresilo (o 12 pozdeji nekdo volal zpatky) | If you tell me one more time to watch out for ice, I will curse your nose hair to grow inwards! Seriously. Three identical notifications in a day? | Nelze nastavit oblasti upozornění, aplikace se zaseká při změně oblastí | Nemyslím si, že by se tato aplikace měla používat na hromadne posílání zpráv o tom, že v nějakem místě bude odstávka teplé vody!! Několikrát!! | Opravte si prosím push notifikace, chodí mi notifikace na havárii vody v Karlových Varech, ačkoliv tam nemám nastavené bydliště a jsem na druhé straně republiky | Nepodporuje tématické ikony. Vývoj aplikace se úplně zasekl, problémy s výlety, kdy vůbec nefunguje potvrzení dosažení cíle. | Aplikace se nebyla schopná zapnout ve chvíli, kdy jsem jí potřeboval využít. (opakovaně padala) | Dobrý den, lze přidat dítě do aplikaci? Plánujete přidat tuto možnost? Děkuji | Dos not work without registration. | Zaregistrovat se mi nepodařilo. V sms chodí nesmyslné znaky. Když zadám 4 místný kód ze sms, aplikace mi napíše try again. Takže je aplikace úplně k ničemu. | Hello, I cannot downland the app to Romania and Belgium google play account because this country's cannot accept the app to be installed. We are in czech republic with the roaming on and we lookingto find a solution for that... Please let us know how to proceed in that way.

Každý, kdo se snaží chopit se informování o téhle věcech je potřeba ...když už není žádný inteligentní způsob, jak to dělat plošně. | Nelze se zaregistrovat. SMS kód se po dvou pokusech stále v aplikaci ""neshoduje"", přestože je určitě správně opsán. | Zachraňuje životy | Super appka, nainstaloval jsem celé rodině. Prima jsou i postupy při první pomoci.

Also, it can be extremely slow. | Velmi dobrá aplikace, kterou se určitě hodí mít na telefonu a s aktuálními údaji. Avšak dnes mi notifikace týkající se koronaviru přišla za posledních dvacet minut asi desetkrát. Což není úplně ideální. Dále po kliknutí na notifikaci se sice otevře aplikace, ale nikoliv obrazovka s textem notifikace. To bych navrhoval zlepšit. | Vážně? Jak dlouho nás ještě hodláte spamovat s notifikací, že ""od 1.9. jsou opět povinné roušky""? Během 15 minut jsem dostal snad 20 notifikací. A asi by to pokračovalo, kdybych appku neodinstaloval. Absolutně na 💩... | Bylo by fajn, kdyby se dalo z notifikace dostat na zprávu do aplikace (info o rouškách od 1. 9.). Notifikace mi na to přišla už asi šestkrát během několika minut, ale po tapnutí jen zmizí. | super koncept, snad ji nikdy nebudu potřebovat | Vše již v pořádku | Vynikající nápad! Aplikace se postupně rozšiřovala o další funkcionality. V poslední době je aplikace otravně pomalá, zasekává se, a padá. Při nastavování aplikace zamrzne. Nepomůže ani restart telefonu. Pomůže jedině re-instal. Raději bych jednoduchou, rychlou a spolehlivou aplikaci než pomalého softwarového ""Otesánka"" s mnoha funkcionalitami.

Češi, pochvalte se! | aplikace se spousti asi 3-4 minuty, nez se da pouzit. nechci si predstavovat jak by to vypadalo kdyby mi slo o zivot. | Podle mého názoru se jedná o velmi užitečnou aplikaci. Bohužel občas ""spamuje"" notifikacemi. Nějaký čas vyžadovala ověření, které již bylo před delším časem provedeno, teď se zase dožadovala hodnocení na Google Play. Proto jenom ty tři hvězdičky - kvůli ""spamování"". Update: Po opětovné žádosti o ověření čísla (již několikrát provodeno) snižuji hodnocení. ------------------------- Update: Nainstaloval jsem si aplikaci na nový telefon. Od přepnutí z EN na CZ je nepoužitelná - desítky sekund timeouty. Rozumím tu, že je apliakce p onainstalování v EN (mám EN jako primární v telefonu). Testováno 3x, žádná jiná aplikace se takto nepoužitelně pomalu nechová. Bohužel na 4. reinstalace jsem již neobdržel registrační kód v SMS. ------------------------- Update 2: Děkuji za aktualizaci. Potvrzuji, že došlo k vyřešení problému a po přepnutí jazyka aplikace správně funguje. | Používám mobil v angličtinĕ. Při pokusu o nastavení českého jazyka v aplikaci, aplikace 2x přestala úplně fungovat (zobrazovala se jen prázdná plocha) a pomohla jen nová instance. Restart mobilu nepomohl. 20.3.2020 Bohužel, zůstalo neopraveno. Odinstaloval jsem a znova nainstaloval aplikaci. Změna jazyka stále nefunguje. Zatuhlá aplikace ovlivnila funkčnost celého telefonu Samsung Galaxy A5, pomohl az restart. UPDATE: Změna jazyka nefunguje ani naopak, tj. z CZ prostředí na EN aplikace. | Nehorázně zasekané a pomalé, 2-3 roky staré funkční zařízení (Nokia 5). Zivot bych te appce asi nesvěřil. | Kde začít. Když jsem byl zaregistrovaný a přepnul z eng do cz tak app už nešla spustit. Info ke korona co chodilo jako upozornění do lišty nešlo nikde v app znovu zobrazit, nebo sem špatně hledal. App jsem tedy odinstaloval a znovu nainstaloval, ale veškeré registrační údaje se smazaly, a nová registrační sms zatím nedorazila. Škoda, vypadalo to jako užitečná app | Nedá se to používat, seká se to, telefon ztuhne na Samsung Note 10 Plus.

Obcas probehne autentifikace, obcas ani to ne. Notifikace o koronaviru se vubec nezobrazi. Pred kauzou koronaviru vse slapalo. | Aplikace zamrzá a nedovedu si představit že bych pomocí ní měl přivolat pomoc, když ji nemůžu v rozumné dobře ani zapnout. | 3/2020 Smazání data a cache nepomohlo, při registraci mi nepřišla SMS. Odinstalace, nová instalace nabídla tel ne 00420 ale +420 a poslala SMS. Změna jazyka = stále zamrznutí... 2/2020: Aktualizace má problémy s telefonem v EN. Minulá verze: Dobrá aplikace. Jen důrazně doporučuji si ji kompletně proklikat. Nepříjemně mne překvapila výzva telefonu uprostřed wizardu první pomoci, kdy se Android dotazoval na povolení nejakych práv... | Hlásím, ze se mi aplikace prestala spoustet. Visi modrý obdelnik na cernem pozadi. | Nefunguje. Aktivace prošla, ale pak při spuštění nejprve asi minutu visí na bleděmodré obrazovce, pak se zobrazí ale po chvilce zčerná a systém napíše, že přestala reagovat. Zkoušeno na aktuálním Xiaomi A2 lite (systém AndroidOne, čili čistý Android). | dobrý den, tak pokud tato app má zachraňovat životy stejně tak, jak padá, nebo jí trvá rozběh, tak to jsme rovnou mrtví, nebo alespoň tam, kde jsme byli před vznikem chytrých telefonů a aplikací (jako je tato) Velké zklamání. Instaloval jsem zejména kvůli novému členu rodiny... Po instalaci když chci vyplnit veškeré údaje, informace o formátu žádné, čili ensurance no. stále hlásí invalid formát.

odmítnout, je na jednu hvězdu že zásady. | Automatic switch on of the location is missing .. | Asi jednou týdně mě aplikace žádá o ověření tel čísla. Přitom říká že moje

Instaluji rodicum. Co je potreba upravit: Pri nouzovem hovoru uz se aplikace NESMI dotazovat na ruzna opravneni, napr. Access to make phone calls. Zraneny clovek nemusi byt ve stavu je acceptovat. Veskera akceptacni opravneni musi probehnout pri prvnim spusteni.

Palce na integraci s okolnimi staty a hasici. | Aplikace je skvělá, až na jeden detail.  Bylo by možné, aby se při prvním spuštění dotázala na všechna potřebná oprávnění (pozice, SMS, telefonování) bez nutnosti použít testovací režim? Jinak bude uživatel v nouzi řešit, co to najednou po něm telefon chce. | Velmi ocenuji Vasi praci. | Aplikace sr rozhodla, že mi bude co 5 minut hlásit, že je dnes ""...den linky 155"". Super :D | Proč najednou vyžaduje aplikace právo zjistit běžící aplikace? | Aplikace je skvela, hodne de mi libi moznost najiti si nejblizsich lekarskych zarizeni. Pokud je toale mozne, uvital bych, aby ""rotovala"", kdyz otocim telefon. Na jednu stranu to muze byt rusit, kdyz budu manipulovat s telefonem a zaroven se zranenym, ale diky tomu, ze mi spadl telefon na zem, mi nejede vrchni pulka displeje, tudiz se nedostanu bez otoceni telefonu k nektrym funkcnim.

Po startu se objevi zluta obrazovka s reklamou a pote jen cerna obrazovka ... | Parádní aplikace pro kontrolu výsledků ... | Po posledni aktualizaci ihned spadlo nicmene Sazka snad do 15 minut od zaslani loga, aplikaci opravila. Good job! | Nelze podavat tikety elektronicky. Az bude dodana tato moznost plus platba kartou zmenim hodnoceni. | Nefunguje scan Sony Xperia | Je mile videt, ze se Sazka chytla za nos a investuje do vyvoje dost na to, aby jeji aplikace obsahovala vsechny uzitecne vlastnosti... Postupne uvolnovani funkci a jednotlivyvh her nevidim jako minus. | Usetri vam to tunu casu chozeni a hledani stanku se sportkou. Miluju kontrolu tiketu pres kameru :-) | splnuje to,co jsem chtela.. rychle naskenuje kod a zkontroluje tiket :-) | upene spatni | Kdyby tak slo vsazet pres aplikaci. Nevim proc to nejde. Takhle musim chodit do trafiky a tak hraju max jednou rocne. Je to nepochopitelne. | Kontrola tiketů ""skenováním"" funguje parádně - už žádné zadávání jednotlivých čísel.  Akorát teda pokud při startu aplikace zmáčknu tlačítko ""menu"" tak aplikace havaruje. | Libi se mi to. Akorat pri vyhre  se zobrazuje mena dvakrat. | No to skenování sázkenky je bomba. Sice vyhrajeme kulový, ale takhle je to jednodušší. :-) | Odinstalovávám.. myslel jsem, že bude možno kontrolovat pomocí čárového kodu, ale nic.. app na nic.","{""1"":943,""2"":167,""3"":429,""4"":2242,""5"":8195}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","SAZKA a.s.","SAZKA+a.s.","info@sazka.cz","https://www.sazka.cz",,"https://www.sazka.cz/ochrana-osobnich-udaju","SAZKA+a.s.","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3oQrQJEZ-9xPL5nKf26duHVqyEkv3yGuTOeu0brseuNBXAweVb0Ob1dfdziF4Yrdw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/v_ftF96MdxeMa6L-4ocOfAj9pwqzLot8sF3kvaOwZYaUR2ZvlSR-0y1ilvn-NKQf5g","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GXI-7Owx9PJGbKHvRr6_wdcONHGRb3JfWsfvqcT3FXU3tmd5f6X74P5l-H5V7vw9dQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/24R856Jc20xvEmdGeTh4m17NMRr-EcIO4pogsU0YKAvKUQMHZBh495Y3x72gZ6t8enU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Xa89bBnIGub8Bv4OlUxMx8Z1KvsdY15Tig0A_PigXsXb_RH6ypnZcI28OaKgrWzO5WcK"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fl7Mkn6fs2M3aLc_soa50T89HLjjKV90ihJfmSSkUDzENC2aLYkXXtPkVF96vH2Ov9w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MHC6w3no2x-r8o1Yw_suZACxg7-sjNAsFCzs6X-913UR9HszO6sSXwsPcKEQTdkZ0AQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/raCAKLQVEBQN3XX6mtdbLHUtmjv63HRvZfGLwOBpK0g9mp1LYt74FW4HYsb7PB8ZtXW7"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/m5Ma1xwWSvTVBGAUfmoKvN0pvWX5QBg48rCY1ZJVRiheQmKqyx8tv8w3PEShrGAB8Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fu6avPLYUgHd_S5wqY4h3YZ-0HH5WAlzY_T9t0FO3fcRd_8_iVnAG3Vm4Afcb4gdWmg""]",,,,"PEGI 18","Real Gambling/Paid Contests",false,"Nov 13, 2013",1709040634000,"11.4.13.4","Vylepšili jsme pro vás svět zábavy.

"YouTube Kids","A video app made just for kids
YouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids

A safer online experience for kids
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
Keep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
Blocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.
Flagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Create individual experiences as unique as your kids
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. 

Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.

All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids
Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.

Parental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.

Thank you for reading this and pls responde back, thank you. | Not worth getting involved with | All the reward points are getting liquidated after 3days but in description it mentioned as 10days more over some times the app is not opening and getting blanc screen and not making to watch except in morning or in the evening some times getting error even with good network connection | This is a cool app the reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the shorts cost way too many coins based off of the prices to buy the coins. One series each episode costs 68 coins inorder to buy enough coins to watch the entire thing it would cost 100 dollars | It interrupts my apps dislike | 0/10 absolutely do not recommend No app has ever irritated me so much that I actually opened the app store to leave a negative review before, the stories are fine but the 60 seconds of the video before 90 second ads or the literal hundreds of push notifications per day. This app can suck a whole bag of eggplant emojis | Really wanted to watch it the adds for one of the shorts on Instagram looked interesting but it only gives you 5 free episodes which isn't worth it | It's fun. | The little stories are great, wish the clips, could be a little longer. I check in everyday, when i can, look forward to the stories.ive given it less stars, because they use to give you 15 chances to unlock more episodes watching ads, They have shorten it to 5, contemplating Deleting the app.🔥 | Love the stories on the app. But after I completed Trapped in Affection some episodes are not playing. It's frustrating because I had to watch all the adds and spent some of my money. For the amount you have to spend on coins it should unlock more than 3 or 4 episodes. | This is a bad app | Bad | Scam scam scam. Reviews don't lie .. it cost me over 75 dollars to finish one story. You only get 5 free add watches a day. Wanted to see exactly what it would cost purchasing coins to view one whole story. 75+ B rate acting at best. Cheaply filmed stories. The stories are fun but in comparison to other streaming apps this is absolutely egregiously overpriced. You can download any other streaming app and literally only pay 10 to $15 a month at most to watch . No one can afford this. | The app wants you to pay for episodes | Good story line but very poor minute and have to still pay while still watching with data. This is absolutely nonsense | Bc it won't let me watch it for free😭😭😭🥺 | It makes you pay to use the app and watch the videos. It only let's you watch free with adds for 5 episodes and then you have to pay $10.00 to keep watching. Total rip off | Disgusting | like the story line | This app is like a parking meter. Keep inserting the coins. Getting spoon-fed miniscule scenes with poor acting. I can not imagine the final cost to watch the entire series. This makes movie theatres look inexpensive. No thanks. I am uninstalling this app and pray that this marketing ploy is a short-lived fad !! | amazing app tho the episodes are too short. | enjoying these beautiful stories. | very nice the content,but it can't play the vedio with out coins,😭😭😭 | very good & excellent | love them | Very good stories... impressive | I love to stories 💕 but I hate all the adds and the price for coins | Giving a good stories and nice dramas to watch | good apps for watch short tv but please make it easy for watching more episode. | good story | Great experience... Thank u | 👌❤️‍🔥🤗💯 | I love it | can't buy using mpesa and too many ads | I love the stories ❤️ | I cannot get the search option | love the app | Super exciting every episode | I love it | good drama shorts. love it | Am so disappointed..I got glued to one of the stories so I purchased twice in raw to open more episodes and now they locked again so if I want to continue watching where I stopped I have to purchase the same episodes I've already paid and opened..a joke 😥 | please can only watch 3 episode's a day we want it for free | spendy | சூப்பர் | Exceptional good and users friendly | love it | very entertaining | I love it. It's very good, but I hate how they make us watch It. Add for every single episode and you only get 5 ADS. And then you have to pay for it. It makes me mad because some people don't have money to spend on it. | Frist This app is a Fake | I enjoy the stories. have to watch aides to read free but that's okay. | Super cool stuff and highly entertaining and excellent quality. | nice to watch | its a good movie to watch | High quality | love this app🥰 | The storylines are great. Having to pay for every episode is a rip-off scam. It's a disgusting practice. If you decide to charge a fee, at least charge in bulk. Not every episode when there are over 20 episode. | Awesome | I have been watching this but they teach us a lot of thing children should watch this app its interesting | I ❤️ it... keep laughing and wanting more | it is a nice app but too expensive | love it | THEY should have ways to earn coins! | I love it | nice storys | I like the movies, but the prices are insane. It's $9.99 for 19 1-minute long episodes. To see the whole movie that I've been watching (90 episodes), it would cost $50, which is insane. I was paying $4.99 for Paramount Plus and Peacock, which have tons of options for shows and movies. I'm going to try to finish watching the movie the free way, but after every minute, I have to watch a 30-second ad. You can only watch 5 episodes per day if you do it the free way. I'm going to uninstall this app. | awesome storylines | Nice story | stories are a little bit different | Have only had for a few hours, and with all the issues and bad ""pay per video segment"" polices as well as purchasing more coins. This is one of the worst services for mandarin Chinese short film drama. | why do we have to pay 😭 because I have to pay you give me a five 🤩 | very good and nice story | the ending is not good it is short i strongly suggest for better please have a happy ending..tnx and please the lead character must have strong personality and not only the kontrabida always win especially the male lead not always his hurting the female lead the fenale lead must win always or have a solution always if the bad character do bad things. the the female lead | jempol deh | Good stories although you lose more money than you came in with | love the stories | the movie are nice and very interesting | Wow love this short drama movies... | bagus film2nya | the movies are interesting and entertaining too worth the while | I just started watching one of this shows I was by episode 15 but now I'm on 5 again and they a charging me to watch these episodes all over again even when I already paid for it. Scam. | really I'm enjoying this short TV apps | Too stretched till it got winding and boring. I was watching I Can Hear You and spent some money just to keep watching a long and winding story. It should be Long Tv instead of Short Tv because there are overwhelming number of episodes and they cost too much. Gave up on the series instead. | Very nice app actually | Horrible | really great watching the short film. | i think the app should have a mermaid story | I love every novel you had | plz unlock the chapters plz I request you to plz ❤️ plz plz 🥺😭 | I love it!! | should be able to watch more without having to get coins | Amazed | love it | too Much Aid But Good | Good app | 👍👍👍👍😍 | It's a good concept but every time I get going through episodes my coins mysteriously dissappear not only that but I'll watch a couple episodes then it'll tell me that I need to unlock the previous episode when I already have, but then when I go out of it and back in it shows that I haven't watched those episodes and wants me to pay again and resets my coins. Please fix this | need more free ads | I really enjoyed every bit of it. Thank you. | If I could leave 0 stars I would. You shouldn't have to pay over $30 for 1 ""short"" series. Ridiculous. | love it | Paid 25 with my facbook linked would keep signing me out so I used the guest account it kept signing me into paid another 10 hot the coins paid another 25 got zero coins ap constantly glitches waste of time money an you can't even fish a story 60 dollars in what a rip off | It good app but you need to pay money But don't worry you watch by watching ads😉 | Worst app don't fall for it, they ll ask you money and the movies we can't see what we can watch is only ads | Enjoyable,well made and good acting. Recently I asked re pricing and was pleased with the quick response and willingness to work with the customer. But then after giving 5 stars shortTv I have to pay 2 more NZD 18.99 and so many ads. I am so sorry but shortTv your destroying the enjoyablilty of the stories. | excellent series | Constantly logging me out while I'm watching and takes forever to load even with wifi. It's so glitchy | it good but the money day are paying is too much | alot of the stories really draw you in! | I logged in using Facebook as well as Google it still shows as visitor | Really disappointed. Watched all the ads which take forever only not to have the rewards granted & also the check in bonus not to work. Only had it for 2 days!!!! | good story | I paid $26 for coins and could not get a refund because it logged me out after it took my money and I lost all of it. Email them for a refund and didn't hear anything. | Not the greatest. Bought roughly 800 coins and opened 2 episodes. Don't use this app | love it | like this is good | I like all the little stories I have seen and the ones sometimes I wish that I can be one of them women | fair to middle acting not great but my teen daughter love it | wow this is the best app | am out of words not exaggerating but it's super awesome | I hate that I need to get coins just to watch a 1 minute clip. | I think we shouldn't have to pay so much money to watch the episodes. We should be allowed more free ones pure month. Cheaper budles/packs as well. But e joy the shorts. Just too short. Lol | love the stories | i love it | So many bugs. The videos I've already watched are now saying I have to pay to watch to moved forward. And the earning coins is a joke. They disappear as soon as you earn enough to watch another video. It's like they are trying to FORCE you to spend real money to even watch their episodes. This whole app is a joke. | love the stories linees | I don't like the ending because there is no closure | nice movie | cool stories told in a fun way | amazing app I love the story lines | Of 1 | great | nice short story here | good | I so love this app!!!but I just wish for cheaper coin packages | very good | very nice series | One of the best app ever.... if not the best . | the story is very good | so nice | Great app 👍🏻 | love the stories","{""1"":0,""2"":0,""3"":0,""4"":9239,""5"":60056}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 3.49 - CZK 5,699.99 if billed through Play","7.0","7.0","VARY","SHORTTV LIMITED","SHORTTV+LIMITED","shorttv.service@shorttv.live","https://www.shorttv.live","ROOM 1002, 10/F, EASEY COMMERCIAL BUILDING, 253-261 HENNESSY ROAD, WAN CHAI, HONG KONG","https://www.shorttv.live/privacy-policy.html","SHORTTV+LIMITED","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0blHpZUvwXmASnGimZKbEVuwHDf4XKJS8us-9STAoqGirqgK6fVFyCiQPvnECkwYrogc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OnoXr0Ni58j3MzMcxM8shCMAnnA10DINTDO9vzPiyBix8kwos4qnXe3mJm8UxCHOq8c","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZhjBJu1iRQXUVIkBbIIYfbrhJohXbEZHG03cRO0Ptnq6Q6H1A2Vj3TJDY19P6WxXvzE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5THZDMpFEHlaIlLdqFfNgPwIJEzljnfWrzNnx31wgnGgvm089u-LH6CEX-XfQW3gYj0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aObteHLyHYUhXMwiHJ8otfRGBhPbJ14SAKrwJroramj_iCOjVXkC4unuxOwwKcQCmg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8C_79gUN8xnEIrvhVvRdzYl3oh2t2rR7UX66wBsHwDhAxP_xeUxRr2iccoUplL0ziA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BY2EXl9IlrptPGYvCs1LEaK7e_z-ueFBCVQ-QOTTfHKJJWn1C3EXq5tSIwsoYlsF3mM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L-IDvnKZgnqZRzOvACkBiz-WLErejOvLQzLTdOpXqurBzCMKFavLwhHJokoZuyR7zSk""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",true,"Sep 3, 2023",1708930732000,"1.7.0","1.

If you drink, eat, exercise, have any pathological condition or depressed emotions before sleep, see how these slumber habits can impact your sleep.
 
📲- Track Your Sleep Phases
Sleepers will have 4 or 5 sleep cycles during the night. Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when most dreaming happens) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.
 
Sleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.
 
📈- Get Your Sleep Score
Sleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better.

Love how it shows light sleep and deep sleep. Also it gives an overall sleep quality result. | perfect app | 5/5 give litsen for free tho | Awesome app | I love that I can finally figure out what's wrong with my sleep! | Nice app | I've been using the app for almost a year but now I'm not getting accurate reports. It tellme that I've been sleeping a significantly shorter time than actual. Example: says I slept 30 minutes when I know I was asleep at least 7 hrs. Very frustrating | ❤️ | access to absolutely nothing without paying. | They seem to have a very well established app lots of sound tracks and even stories along with sleep tracking and you can connect to google fit if you have one! | It's good works well | nice | Nice | Very nice 👍🤌 | Nice app and segments the sounds. You guys can give me the option to add more tags instead of selecting from the list you shared or choosing others. | Apparently there's a free plan but you can't get past the part where you have to select a yearly or monthly plan. | This is the best but not really I read the comments and it's kinds bad | Wasted app | Is so awesome | Good | Cringe and sus app. I didn't connect this to my Facebook but got notifications that I connected the app. | They want money for everything | Nice try should try for anlysis your sleep | Overall the interface and aesthetics are fantastic and the app records and categorizes your sleeping sounds excellently. However, the option to listen to recordings is locked behind the paid version of the app, which requires recurring billing. As the only real reliable functionality of the app is listening to your snoring behavior, the unlocked version would perhaps be worth a small payment, but as-is, this app is not worth the expensive recurring costs. | Great app for monitoring sleep, lots of info | Try it help u sleep better 👍 | Easy to use | Good | Good app | Good app | Ok | I need to sleep more so it really helps to know the stats and it's rewarding to know when I've slept more on a particular night I can work out what works best for me. | 🤭 | Best app for Android for free | Helped me sleep | this was actually a really good app. it helped me learn how to control my snoring, ect. definitely recommend | busy | I have used this app for only one night and am pleased with it. Easy to navigate but I wanted to show my kids but did not find the record/ results later in the day. | Great | Great app | The best app ever | Great app, I didn't know I did those things while sleeping , lol With all types os sounds to help you on your journey to dream. Monitoring numerous statistics, | Easy to use. | Excellent | I'm giving it a 1 because of the blatant misuse of female sexuality in the advertising. It looks like you're advertising a dating site or porn. Please change that! | Love the app.......Thanks So many perks | Tracks well give nice detailed sleep stats really love it | Love the app and I think it is a strong app to use if you want to record yourself snoring, talking in your sleep etc. | I really am happy I found this app. It tells you all about your REM sleep, shows you a graph, and records your sleep noises. And that's for free. For only two euros per month, you can find out your sleep apnea risks and snoring, different breathing exercises, more soundscapes, and much much more. Highly recommend. | Good | First time user, so not sure if working as yet. | Wow! | It is actually the perfect tracker for me....it tracks things way perfectly than I thought! Perfect!! | WARNING: THIS IS A VIRUS! DON'T INSTALL IT. | good analysis | very good | Easy to use and helpful sleep data! | This app thoroughly impressed me, beautiful, intuitive and they seem to have thought about every feature, well done team | Great app | Upon first use, I immediately hit a subscription barrier, with 80% of the app's features locked away. The app aggressively promotes discounts and offers a month's premium inexchange for a apositive review upfront, raising questions about the authenticity of its high ratings. It's hard to fairly assess the app when most features are inaccessible. A 7-day trial could offer a better initial experience, allowing users to fully explore the app before committing. | Excellent app, I love it. It changed my life, making me more cautious of my sleep habits and that I needed a cpap | Powerful sleeping app...wow, download this powerful app now | The ad said it's free, but then it is asking for a subscription fee once you download it | Very nice | Good | Best app ever | Helpful | Lots of information and reporting on the free version. Now I want to use the premium version. | Everything about this app is centered around a subscription they want you to pay. Without paying them you get nothing. | Yep | It's nice and helps me learn how I sleep at night. | I love it it helps me sleep even though I hate premium...I wanna hear myself sleep but can't... | Awesome | So good ! I to helps me so much! The music is so relaxing 😌 !! Good app!! RECOMEND!! | Looks ok but can't use it for it purpose until youmoay for a subscription | I hve already subscribed..still it is asking me to upgrade?? And my previous night sleep data is also gone.! The contact us section doesnt work either..wat kimd of scam is this. I need my sub money back or get this resolved asap. | 😒 | Nice | Okey so you take the money for one year, when you say there you subscribe one month what a fraud you make here, you didnt even ask if i wanted a year, you just show what cost in one month and in 1year The you tax me for the whole year FRAUD | JUST A MONEY GRABBING APP! Can't listen to any of your sounds throughout the night unless pay and subscribe! Very poor app! | Really good app but the main purpose I wanted to use this app was so I can listen to what I say during the night but I have got pay to do so on this app | Can't actually listen to any recordings without subscribing first. If you click on one star in app, no leave feedback button appears and it won't take you to google play. Looked so good too. But too sketchy for my liking | Best | it's nice and warm | Doesn't have any resemblance to what I actually am sleeping! Total waste of time and money. I would rate it in negative numbers if available. I'm trying to figure out how to cancel and get my money back!!! | Without EEG, eye and limb movement, oxygen saturation as well as a microphone for snoring, it is impossible to define patient sleep architecture. I emailed the developers asking for research comparing the app to the gold standard, polysomnography, but they did not respond with any. They did say they would add accelerometers but this is still insufficient. You can use the phone's recorder to listen for snoring. The app is not worth paying for. | Im not going to buy the premium to listen and buy the pro ver | I have just started using this app. So far, it is doing what it is supposed to. I will add more information as I go. | The best I've slept in years. Thank you | helpful | Downloaded app and wouldn't let me try it out for free. Automatically uninstaled. I won't pay for anything until I can get an idea of its worth to me.... | I love with all the features..wanna try for monthly subscription,but it's only provide yearly option..will use for free first | ❤️ | I love this a apps | Amazing app | you forces you to pay | Really helpful app nice interface | It's good but when ever I want to hear a noise what I did in night then we have to buy like what | Perfect | Great app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | I love it 😍😍💓 | Very nice | This app is so relaxed 😚❤🌠🌃 | This is an amazing tool to track your sleeping patterns. I've used it to make improvements in my eating/living/sleep rituals to see what improves my sleep, with real time results of what does and doesn't work. Everyone can benefit from using Sleep Monitor Sleep Tracker. | Useless and incorrect | Good | Brilliant app. | Advertised as free but it's not! Deceptive and untrustworthy!! | It's very good | Haven't been sleeping well lately and have had no luck finding an app that actually works, until this one! Now I know why I'm waking up exhausted! Thank you! | Pay | Delete fake | Good | Good | Nice app I can finally listen to myself | The best sleep I've ever had! | Some sort of gambling app? Showed a spinning wheel with prizes after loading it the first time. Uninstalled it after that, very confused | Expensive Excellent | Good | This really is a game changer, I've had trouble getting to and staying asleep for quite a while. I've tried other sleep monitoring apps but I'm not sure if it's the range of noises you can listen to or the clinical data you can read through after the event but it certainly helps lull you off to sleep highly recommended. | Great sleep app | This is not worth your data and download, it didn't even record anything, because it incountered trouble, but my phone says the app was in use the whole night, and then like everybody says it behind a paywall anyhow, I think it would be nice if there was something free not just immediately paying, for probably Ann app that doesn't work | it is just perfect,I totally love the app | Subscription based. I am so tired of all these apps having Subscriptions. I have enough Subscriptions. Don't need more. | 😍😍😍😍😍😍Excellent | Ilove it | It is a very good app | Looks like it's tracks the sleeping stats well. I like the break down. | Great 😃 , Sleep Moniter Is Excellent tool for Tracking & analysing My Sleep Pattern . | Good app for tracking your sleep, though you do have to pay premium for most things. It's quite a good app!! | Nice 😌 | I will say it's the one of the best application I ever download accent job whoever make this app Good job | lousy app | Good | واو | You have to pay to listen to any sounds dont waste your time | Have to purchase . Thought it's free | Fantastic and accurate App! I would highly recommend it to everyone. My elderly mother has trouble sleeping. I am now going to use the Sleep Monitor App, so we have an idea of how much/long she slept before going to see a doctor with the information Sleep Monitor App has provided. 5 STAR'S 🌟 ALL THE WAY. | No trial subscription, only paid one. And the subscription is damn costly. Uninstalled the app. | Wonderful app. Don't forget to re-install after Android or IOS updates. Especially when you notice that it stopped tracking / working. This is your cue to re-install. You probably had your phone updated by Samsung, Apple, Google, or whatever phone brand you own. | This app is just amazing! | Why does it tell me to connect charger while sleeping? What if I don't?! I mean I don't want to ruin my battery by charging all night! So please tell what's the reason for highlighting that charging part?? | Nice | Love this app. To be honest it really helped me w my sleep. | Easy to set up and lots of useful features | The best sleep monitor app in the all play store. It records accurately every single important data about you while sleeping and analyses the quality of your sleep too. A must have app. | I'm sleep soo fast | I absolutely love this app it records everything I bought it yearly andan it records everything I absolutely love it. Tracks my sleep when I'm awake my sounds even my husband snoring lol but seriously Iove this all. It keeps track with everything I will be paying again next year I love it alot. | Has really helped with my sleep | Me quedo impresionado, creo que intentaré pagar la suscripción para ver las demás características. | App constantly quits on it's own, not recording anything. If it decides to work the volume of any recorded sounds are so low that even with my phone at full volume it's impossible to hear it. I canceled my subscription and do not recommend this app!! | It does what it says, and very well at that! | Nice | This is only my 4th day using it, but every night has been inaccurate in its records. It says I take minutes to fall asleep, when it can take more than an hour. One night I was coughing and sneezing, and checking the time on my phone occasionally, yet it says I was asleep during all that, and didn't record any movement. Didn't even record my dogs barking all night one night. All customer support does to ""help"" is ask where I keep my phone. I put it on my nightstand, a foot or two from my head. | It is really good | Te ayuda demasiado en tu sueño | It's very good, it's helping my sleep sm | Great App!! | Excellent | It's good but it makes you pay for 90% of the app | This app sucks i tried the sleep tracker and only 2 weren't paid so deleting this app gor good | Nice | Good and helpful app | Very good app | Nice app | Good | Such a good app it recorded my sleep very well would recommend | Amazing, sleeping better | Positive | I love this app. No i know how my night goes | slightly more expensive but otherwise ok | Helps me sleep,playing relaxing and calming music. | It's a nice and soothing layout. The background noises are calming as well. Right now I am quite enjoying the help of the App. That said I am looking forward to a better sleep. | Very nice it really helped me reduce stress in when I wake up | it's accidentally taken my money. so I just use and it's good. | Love it | Awesome app tracked my sleep activity very efficiently | Good 1 | I actually sleep quite well, had no idea I talk in my sleep | It helps me sleep better | 😍😍😍😍😍î | Helped me improve my sleep | Please don't use... Thats it..... No more comments | Buen programa | This has really helped me sleep for the past couple of weeks | UPDATE: Subscription is now reflecting. Some links like Contact Us need rechecking though. Thanks Sleep Monitor team! UI is buggy. I bought a yearly subscription but it did not reflect in the app. Connecting to Google Fit is a two step procedure, while disconnect it is as easy as one tap. Quite suspicious. The link to Contact Us prompts a system share instead of actually displaying a useful email that I can contact. Please fix. Thank you! | Its was really relaxing I enjoyed my sleep much better highly recommended best app for sleeping problems | Fake everything. Is ads | Very Helpful! I hope there is nothing to pay | Good | Its very helpful app | Nice app | Excellent app | Used to be so good till you updated it. Now it's constant ad walls, music dosent load. It's extreamly battery draining. And just overall dosent work properly.","{""1"":7330,""2"":733,""3"":0,""4"":5131,""5"":62716}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 25.99 - CZK 5,299.99 if billed through Play","7.1","7.1","VARY","Fasting APP Group","6102696118242940173","SleepMonitor.dev@gmail.com","http://sleepmonitor.emobistudio.com/","SUITE 2706, 27/F SHUI ON CTR, NOS 6-8 HARBOUR RD WANCHAI, HK","http://sleepmonitor.emobistudio.com/h5/privacy.html","6102696118242940173","Health & Fitness","HEALTH_AND_FITNESS","[{""name"":""Health & Fitness"",""id"":""HEALTH_AND_FITNESS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-Y6I8lfxbkZ3WhuVLhsITZCbdGjz0Z_Lj__DOCcHvPrTWdjudg9Lsq9UHvWgefN-bu4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r3OFVccA0tQy1ZoCqNgikLj41S7sr_oGMvxRcYzGpiFj37sPXRRUJfRxDgm8AL-pdjU","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UXEA2TyBvvU1WlTcp4hSpJ4pdIwS_j9jeyRowKF1VMxPYFp2hQrSOXEtvkA94cjyDNiU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/k3lYLD8CLlW2OiFvaxWVfwkyYZYRYG3L831pg7bUjuW82JMdLwP-1RV6eje51Kyl8r8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FWeqFsNXyiqUI6OqfQPZaZYNaAVqLqtF_-ffmN-9IMDfVwYPu0r3KuAM3aFSB7273TZA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b1uA4TWkjvCeSv4-edGth-krN3XaQmu4OaO7WoQWtlENKxlPExDXO4_KaiGtrlLfSr4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_3lrNgI5krxjYuLTBoycGxauXu9EWfHOP5wY_bahuEpVwveV5SW89iiIIrKjh33wMw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fmL0BnvIEvkTnMxfq4VVxVgy7pmAIM_WznCt42_6inoVTk_aV9R3dl6RBSFYEWCv6X_U"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7v4eLr5hjzvblyCXzJz9Mcxx1Z_XfWZ_NQ8vyOlyvD-0bqR5cvmINGaeaBGVDuKGlpo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bPRn-JMiMxWaSQYZY_CrOfAUi72VaAG7nNPO2ANfiXCqRotC5tcx1OFiFqVHo3YxxQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QSqqENzW3Dd2FciAGDMVWOVul5ulrX6qIIh8mSba2SXGgerYO5d1fAE1y7Diq_QL7_w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lCNO9ef4yixg1EMp0KCrLHMuMbzcBYvYbVd12e7pX6WO5KIROakrJYO_dEibcAuBPw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nNVMqQDVkozyfg7XAv1Ygeyrfy8RGE_KWSm4I6hNQ-KDxcJqAAr6aa7vhwBMwNhz8X4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pyIArbq2iOCpOH1CDIj96gA8AdQYmQCyfV5eRxmBTxKHEt_bCwepZXLUo17rTv6R83M"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ff0OlC_RvldwCffsp50hDEvNZNuwQDf0VLgfxkzK42TbFbEPINB5QHfeuIlpnV6quw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JV51nIKJ1bR9bF4O0Lohu8__CZNTceZV4yAmVzyS4kBO1vJ1ohNPVCkWP0-g72R1-mU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/814Zrrm0ahnNhUUzN7QDL6P8eq1LhfGecC4dQ4KUMHVawoNTgVv4miSUtwIewVOsytY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2fzEpLXIDu-tMbQIS4mtQMMPAGAl-ewvnbIrShiMKk5HqSQxGfqKOiaYyqKcK7iqM68"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BbgvJF2oAa_wUDrCakTTgst8gPN5ZiDoedF_3tZtrDokGbC2HBntmHmE3Na8Upvzmg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZkjTJxAVgq_PlBqUU54VUgo3iFbJvL2LUXIrWPgfrvhWD9dCEH8M8q1It96YVe6PT-s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dMRj2Ub9h6sh0xygjHYMdhrbQ9FrA8u-aw9xj005UGQeirqABwR3gdBvZiJu2mxTLNc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/S51EGv_KgWqnJS_0FwD86ZqEstDCYTu5FNILJQzLnIlMVDjEAc3Q480QE7iDO_PoXBE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7pnHyJSliZj26WpkZ7C2Aqbuz0sYDp9DhUpT-rOlg_tlSRHxCrCbvprn4XQX3Lmx6A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5oIX8G9ZW0XDqF3RgUcZwPVd_Fy4GUY-RVHtXDk77LTAyHh3bPF0_vQ6giK1wxTLSElJ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cFKd4B6it_Xw69JDPa6zWndeIiAR8Qy3ReHmoBceIDWQFADFxbHtoyjSqY7vjaSSeoI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3eQaUagqkwhK31BlOnQaivg2Jsxp9dkPE28lHL6gRsQgeb_0QmPLtoUKIPZUBvmw1nI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ouBxzRgz_W0UkULbHjvQsZFP-bpeuS64QnST6mLsk14lv7kvJumaGjrlK_G55Vikyw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WmRXVCx4AHwsfblYMfS3WGliHPHO6sfS8rZiNyVCyNl3JaFzkBDb-wW8gWu_3LUxyb8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PoKZqVI2aBUu_7RhmUtcpUuAM2Fa1ApTCgE2nVGbtFWbWUy9ZBt3vPrOIVs6DIJ2WCs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/u1-ba1gOEuEiHQRv4KTVzAQdIdVhCymLWy_UthoJ4dwQEv9q2BmwkaBs26g0j_UL-yA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A-Z0BmNMVWJLXOXyaxe1igyLrKfKmkN0xFhz9AU3_D8phqaHcgXoX7Zq-BJt_mDLbA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UGpHP8VxH1znv-BY244LM8U7ycXgFCoinn4zSibRy1_DdCcdcgzIqskCJGgTujE3538"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/evyKGW_Pp40ThudOmrDnBTcXK55_0pP6t3J22fLfoHmFvI5RIZCTaCLsrb1oO5eTLtKQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oaf1eIQIkA-1m0rEU6XfUHTkji-zHRjIKmi4jA5pZBBZcPVc7vSdtYLgWk6f9DpXiEM""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,true,"Sep 13, 2019",1711092171000,"v2.6.9.4","We are thrilled to announce that the latest version of Sleep Monitor is now available, bringing a range of significant improvements and bug fixes to ensure you get a better sleep tracking experience.<br><br>Download the latest version and start enjoying an improved sleep quality monitoring experience!","[""Without EEG, eye and limb movement, oxygen saturation as well as a microphone for snoring, it is impossible to define patient sleep architecture.

Jestli můžu poprosit, udělejte s těmi notifikacemi něco. | Sometimes fails, saying ""not installed from an official source"" even though I installed it through Google Play Store. That makes it very scary to use, because I never know whether I can show my ticket or not. | Vyhledávání zastávek nefunguje, ať píšu co píšu nic se nezobrazuje, jediné jak lze zadat zastávku je manuálně z mapy. | Nějak to funguje,ale proč je část aplikace česky a část anglicky? V nastavení mám nastavenou češtinu. | After last update is totally unusable. Endless flashing by display after start. A new version resolve the issue. Thanks | To the public: Be aware please - today happened to me what people have mentioned before: the bus was late and I activated the ticket immediately after entering the bus. The ticket inspector saw this, and immediately fined me CZK1,000 because of an invalid ticket on his electronic equipment! Dear PID Litacka...please 🙏 the application needs the option to invalidate the ticket immediately when entering a bus!! That option should be available, just like with normal paper tickets. | snaha o zlepsovani se ceni... ale nechapu proc pri cestovani vlakem mimo Prahu apka nedokaze odecist aktivni rocni kupon a doporucit nejvyhodnejsi jizdenky... v souvislosti se systemem pasem kdy je P O B centrum jako 4 pasma je to vždy výpočetní dobrodrůžo s hledáním stanice kde centrum končí a kolik dalších zón je potřeba:)) | Aplikace funguje skvěle, lze nastavit aktivaci jízdenky jak manuálně, tak automaticky. Je však důležité si dát pozor na dvouminutovou lhůtu před opravdovou aktivací lístku, ale na ni i sama aplikace upozorní. Lístky na delší dobu taky fungují dobře, nikdy jsem s nimi problém neměla. Doporučuji :) | I have multiple requests for this application. 1. Create please an adaptive color icon for Android 14. 2. Make the name shorter to one word ""Litacka"". It will look cleaner in app drawer on Android! 3. Create a dark mode for application. It's a basic feature for all modern application and it's weird to not have it these days. Thank you! | Dobré odpoledne, děkuji za dobrou aplikaci. Používám už hodně let. Dnes jsem dostal problém. Aplikace dokáže najít cestu na letiště z jakékoli zastávky. Z letiště to ale jinak nejde. Verze aplikace 4.0.2. Hezký víkend, | Thie ticket QR code NEVER scans properly on suburban buses (where you have to present tickets to the driver when boarding). Make your QR codes more clear and compatible with different display sizes. | I like the app. Much better than most other European cities public transport apps around. Things to improve? Of course. | Terrible. After the last update all purchased tickets disappeared. | pokaždé když se snažím si koupit lístek na delší dobu (třeba roční) tak se mi nejméně dvakrát ukáže error, peníze se mi strhnou a za 10 minut se mi vrátí na účet a můžu to zkoušet znovu. Tenhle problém už se mi děje víc jak rok :/ | Proč na záložce mapa není mapa.pid.cz? To je tak obrovský nevyužitý potenciál. Mapa se zastávkami by mohla mít alespoň čísla linek. Takto to není moc užitečné. Lepší je otevřít mapy.cz tam je víc informací. | Aplikace se při přepnutí do jízdeneky a v ní záložku kupóny spadne a sice načte data ale nedá se použít pro revizora protože vždy spadne dokud nepřehodím záložku do pár sekund po startu do záložku vyhledávání | Are you serious? Mám kupón a dnes se aktualizovala aplikace a po spuštění nejen že pořád problikava obrazovka ale po smazání cookies vůbec není identifikátor v aplikaci. Blázni. A teď se to otevřelo, piplo a kontrolorka řekla, že identifikátor nenalezen. | Nová verze aplikace se nedá používat! Chybí jí nějaké oprávnění kvůli čemuž neustále jen bliká dialogové okno a nejde vůbec nic udělat, samozřejmě ani zobrazit zakoupený kupón. | The latest (new) version of app keeps crashing on Pixel 8 Pro, Android 14. | Když si jako výchozí místo dám Praha, vždy to nejde spojení ze zastávky Staroměstská! Tohle jsem fakt nikde neviděl... Podle aplikace není spojení z Masarykova n. do Nymburka přes Poříčany! EDIT Podívejte se na IDOS, Pubtran, CG Transit, pro ně ten váš ""široký pojem"" problém není. Spojení do NB Lítačka nenajde, pošlu vám screenshoty, jestli chcete (obávám se, že výsledky dává každou chvíli jiné). Apka mi nevyhovuje, protože nefunguje - jak si mám asi koupit jízdenku, když mi nenajde spoj? | I've reinstalled it a few times, nothing has changed | Been using the app for about a year or two.. This morning - obviously after an automatic update.. Infinite message box blinking and saying that notifications are not enabled. Cannot click on any button because the box just keeps appearing and disappearing. Workaround: enable the main notification switch in settings (particular notifications may then be disabled by individual switches). | This app has stolen 1500kc from my account. It failed to purchase a ticket but still took the money out | I have to applaud the team behind this app, the feature set is great and works like a charm. I appreciated the option to easily transfer transit passes between devices in a matter of seconds. | Naprosto stupidni propojeni s Idolkou. Pri pokusu o registraci na Idol se clovek dozvi, ze ucet uz existuje. Dobre, reset hesla. Jenze to cloveku zresetuje heslo na PID, odhlasi z Litacky, ale nejen z ni, ale taky z Rekola a Nextbike! Pri pokusu reset hesla na Pid pak nekonecne klikani na obrazky motorek. | Dear developers. You actually need to add lower measure to start validity from for year pass. I could choose start date earlier than my previous pass finished. It's really annoying. Other customers, be careful and check twice start date before you buy a new pass!!! | Super aplikace pro dopravu v Praze. Hvězdičku strhávám za to, že při nákupu jízdenky více kategorii musím provést více plateb a nejde udělat jeden košík a ten zaplatit najednou. Strašně to zdržuje a určitě i provozovatel plati více na provizi za platbu kartou:-) | Na vyhledávání spojů ok, ale pokaždé, když se v aplikaci snažím zakoupit Lítačku, peníze se mi odečtu z účtu, ale Litacka nikde, prý platba selhala. :) Peníze pak sice vždy vrátí, ale nechápu, proč raději neopraví ten problém. Několik mých kolegů má podobnou zkušenost. Raději doporučuji kupovat kupony přímo ve stanicích metra. | Je to pekne. Jen zakoupene jizdenky jsou nahle ukradeny s tim, ze se meni cena. Bez pozadani emailem nejsou vraceny. Kupovat jizdenky dopredu je tedy zcela bez jistoty ze nebudou opet ukradeny. | Aplikace každých 5 vteřin spadne a není možné ji používat. | Foregin tourists beware! In their search for money, the public transport company will fine you 1000 Czech crowns despite having a purachased and activated ticket, simply because of a technicality - a two minute timer on the activation. Buy your tickets physically! That way the ticket inspectors (who get a commission from the transport company for ever person they ""catch"") will go home empty handed! | Aplikace vždy spadne když chci najet na zakoupené permanentky. Jsem zvědavý, co tomu bude říkat revizor... | Dřív šlo konfigurovat jaké záložky si zobrazit v dolním menu, teď cpete natvrdo věci, co mě nezajímají a to co chci dát nejde. Nebo je to tak neintuitivní, že jsem na to nepřišel. JŘ radši hledám přes google mapy, tahle ""oficiální"" hrůza ani neumí zobrazit zatahující spoje, ostuda. Výběry se neustále resetují při každém překliku, neskutečně otravné. Takže jediná použitelná funkce je zobrazení kupónu revizorovi, to je teda trochu málo... | Just got fined 1k because your app is incapable of charging me 3 times in a row. Good job! | Keeps crashing.. have to screenshot to show it to the validator of the tickets. | Application started to crash, I have a one year pass that I can't use anymore 😭😅 nice move PID Upd: crashes only when I go to Tickets page. 💪 | What's the point of setting favorite tickets if they get forgotten? | Nefunkční, nelze se vůbec přihlásit. Když dám obnovit heslo a přes zaslaný link ho úspěšně změním, ani na nové heslo se stejně nedá přihlásit. O překlep jistě nejde, heslo se plní ze správce hesel. Nepodporuje tematické ikony. | Nelze se připojit k serveru. Paráda, když si člověk předem nakoupí lístky, ale pak je nemůže aktivovat... Zkusil jsemni smazat všechna data aplikace a nelze se ani přihlásit ke svému účtu. | Aplikace crashne vždy pokud otevřu záložku s lístky nebo průkazkou, takže si lístky nemůžu přes aplikaci koupit, ani se přes aplikaci prokázat. Tímto je bohužel zcela nefunkční pro tento účel, takže se s ní dají pouze vyhledávat spoje :( už je to pár měsíců, tak doufám, že to dříve nebo později opravíte, protože jinak jsem doteď byl s appkou maximálně spokojen. | I have bought the ticket but it said insufficient balance in the card and also the amount deducted as well. Customer service not available to call, please return the money I have paid through online | Super appka, bohužel když bylo potřeba tak nebylo možné aby se načetla, pořád padala.... Musela jsem odinstalovat a zase nainstalovat, pak to fungovalo - samozřejmě ale až poté co mi vypsal revizor pokutu. | Crashes when I start it, I use nothing phone 2, it runs android | After last update impossible to purchase monthly pass via the app. 5 purchase errors in a row for Google Pay and Card Payment | mohlo by tam být i přehled o lítačce třeba do kdy platí kupon nebo tak, já si to nepamatuju a nechce se mi to hledat a ani otravovat paní u pultíku, popřípadě i dobíjet lítačka.. 😅 Po nove aktualizaci pada a nejde ji ani otevrit. | Pořád nemá tmavý režim | Proboha, proc si nemuze aplikace pri zavreni, nebo prepnuti pamatovat poslwdni heldani. Otravne porad zadavat dokola. | Would be great app without 2 minute rule for ticket activation. | Po spuštění, kdy potřebuje člověk ukázat nebo koupit jízdenku, tahá nějaké megabyty aktualizačních dat. To to nejde o aspoň pět minut odložit nebo pozastavit? | Přesun kuponů z fyzické karty na appku je mnohem jednodušší než jsem si myslel. Doporučuji | Prosím pozor na tuto aplikaci v určitých situacích Vás obírá o peníze. Např pokud si koupíte lístek a autobus má zpoždění a lístek expiruje tak si musíte lístek koupit znova. Raději si kupujte lístky v autobuse nikoli přes aplikaci. | It should show more notifications before the expiry of a pass. 29.11.2023: Cannot purchase a pass for second day straight. It shows ""purchase error "" | reliable and well done. must have for visitors | Crashing on pixel 8 | It provides basic navigation but even though it is not accurate, you can not get home reliability... | perfektní, jebat idos | Aplikace crashuje hned po startu, mám nejnovější verzi. Bohužel nejsem schopen předkládat svůj pass. Tohle je možné asi jen v ČR :). | Absolutely horrid software. Also password reset emails take way too long to be sent. Never mind the fact that the message of incorrectly input password is permanently stuck for me. | A great app for a great public transport system! | Super appka. Máte v plánu do ní zaintegrovat i současný web mapa.pid.cz? | Po otevření karty ""Tickets"" aplikace pokaždé spadne | Usually the app works fine however today I needed to travel several times with the 90min ticket. When I tried to activate third ticket for the third ride, the app told me I am entitled for Fare capping and forced me to ""Activate"" this option. However when I follow the process and press activate, I receive a message ""Ticket activation failed, please check your tickets or repeat activation again"". This keeps repeating and preventing me from using already bought tickets. Sigh... | Everything works so far, I use it already 3 years | Po nainstalování na pixel 8 android 14 aplikace nefungovala. Při pokusu o zobrazení stránky s kuponem a QR kódem aplikace okamžitě spadla. Komplet vymazání dat, odinstalovani a nainstalování zpátky ovšem pomohlo, a už to jde. | There was an issue with the app but now it works fine! Thanks for fixing the issue! | No olnline card accept. Very inconvenient. | Podstatně lepší způsob placení jízdného než hledání automatů. Oproti SMS si navíc můžete vybrat libovolný tarif. Aktivace jízdenek by zasloužila zlepšení. Nelze např. hromadně vybrat a aktivovat více předem zakoupených jízdenek. Musíte aktivovat jednu po druhé, nebo všechny aktivovat ihned při zakoupení. Výběr pásem je hloupý. Když vyberete P, mohlo by apce dojít, že má rovnou vybrat následující pásma dle jízdenky, nebo by aspoň mohla dynamicky zakázat pásma mimo dosah od prvního vybraného. | Chcete aby Vám lidi platili tisíce za pitomý jízdenky? Tak si to doháje opravte.... nejdou ani načíst spoje vy idioti | Update je nešťastný. Na text se velmi špatně dívá, text je moc malý, všechno nalepené na sebe, chaos | Finally added option to enter address and app giving you route. Thank u! Can u pls add dark mode? | Redesign se povedl. Teď už jenom zbývá přidat možnost při vyhledávání schovat tlačítko na zakoupení lístku, když mám zakoupený kupon. | It frequently crashes on Samsung S23. | Rozbitá nefunkcni zabugovana appka. Ostuda. | Nelze nastavit samoaktivaci jízdenky. Vlak jede v 15:09 a aplikace nabízí pouze aktivaci 0-12 hodin a pak sama sobě hlásí error. Ruční aktivace, zdá se, funguje... | The app seems fine. It only won't tell you enough about ticket activation so that the control fraudsters can rip off tourists. Garbage mentality next to Hungary 🗑️🗑️ | Just pre paid for a three day ticket , so far so good, payment went straight through in Google Pay, but won't know how good until activating and using once there. Will update then. | The 2-minutes-to-activate-ticket rule makes this app worthless. What is it there for? It's better to take your chances and buy no ticket at all if you get fined anyway. Buying paper tickets is more reliable. | Nefunkční aplikace. Verifikační emaily nechodím | I can't buy any tickets. Just says error please try again. Even reinstalling using Google pay or bank card doesn't matter. Same error and I can't buy tickets. | Nepřišla notifikace o konci platnosti permice na rok! Kdybych si to nekontroloval, jel bych na černo!!! | The ticket does not vibrate or notify you when it is activated, so it's easy to miss the tram. When buying a pass, the time periods are in Czech, so it's hard to know what you are buying. | Aplikace se zlepšuje, ale stále je ještě dost prostoru pro pokrok. Ale každopádně užitečná aplikace. | Dobrá aplikace, ale vadí mi že na iOS je jiný, novější, dle mého názoru lepší design než na Android. | The app failed to active the ticket and cost me a fine. | First time in Praha, bought a ticket, found buses and trams I needed. | Works perfectly | Rychlá a intuitivní aplikace, používám na parkování a MHD. Nevěděl jsem jen jak přidat platební kartu natrvalo, ale je možný zaškrtnout uložení při kupování jízdenky. | very rigid but confusing UI | It works very well. The only problem that I would like is reviewed, is that you have to choose between the plastic card, or the app. It should be able to use both. | Attention! The app let me buy a ticket and link it to my card but never clarified that the card cannot be a virtual one. I got fined and when I told them that it is not stated anywhere they told me that they are aware and that they will fix it... However they never took back the fine. | There are too many bugs and the app is still imperfect, I still don't understand why they can't support adding the card to Google Pay and Apple Wallet. | S aplikací nemůžu být více než spokojen. Vše funguje tak, jak má. Jen tak dál. 👍 | I really liked it before, but I am trying to buy a new pass and it doesn't matter which kind of payment I use, it still is not working... Before this, the app was quite nice | I moved my yearly pass from my credit card into the app and it started crashing, but I managed to fix it by reinstalling the app. Apart from this issue, it works fine. It is nice to have Prague parking feature included in the app. | Nejde koupit jizdenka, různé typy jizdenek neustále mizí | Date selection widget is bugged in the registration menu. Disregards selected date of birth and assigns a random one which cannot be changed without visiting an office. | It's keep crashing 😫 | Thank you so much for providing multiple languages, and making it easy to buy tickets! It did seem at first that the tickets bought through search and through the ticket page were different. I'm glad that it's not the case. | The app has been working without any errors for the last six months. I linked Google Pay in the app and paid for all tickets with it. At some point I just couldn't buy tickets in the app. After numerous attempts I got a simple error - failed to buy tickets, try again another time. I linked my bank card instead of Google Pay, but that didn't help either. Then I decided to reinstall the app. Even after reinstalling, I'm not able to buy tickets either through Google pay or banking card. | Zadal jsem špatně příjmení a teď ho nemohu změnit a ani si tam dát účet | Unusable. Crashes a few seconds after startup for no reason. Samsung galaxy s10. | Crashing a few seconds after every launch, unable to use | Stále stejné hodnocení. Aplikace na Google Pixel 7 a Android 13 okamžitě spadne. 30.7.23 - přeinstalace pomohla diky | Neposílal ověřovací mail | Dnes jsem chtel zaplatit parkovani v Holesovicich. Zadal jsem SPZ, zvolil 30 minut delky, a zaplatil. K memu velkemu udivu, aplikaci sama zvolila zacatek parkovani az o hodinu a pul pozdeji, takze pro me uplne k nicemu. Edit: po neuspokojivem vysvetleni od vyvojaru snizim hodnoceni na nejnizsi mozne. | Hodně špatné hledání navazujících spojů, často mi nabízí jen jednu variantu, a kdybych nevěděla, že je i jiná a vhodnější možnost, tak si zbytečně zajedu. Noa o spojích Českých drah škoda mluvit, co to je sakra za komunikaci???? Kontroluji v aplikaci, jestli vlak jede, tak stojím na zastávce/nádraží, vlak nikde a apka stále hlásí žádné zpoždění a vlak už vyjel ze stanice.. omg, pokaždé fakt frustrující, k čemu mi to pak je, kdybych to věděla hned, tak jsem mohla jít na bus nebo něco... | Reinstall fixed the crash, thanks. | Když kupujete roční litacku aplikace bude ukazovat chybu, ale transakce bude probíhat bez vašeho vědomí. Vrácení peněz tým Litacky nepořídí, musíte jet na pobicku DPP. Servis level 1/10. | I bought 2 same tickets and purchased via credit card, money was paid but it didn't show up in application. Please help to find them or return money back. | DOESN'T WORK. | Nemožnost mít Lítačku na kartě a mobilu zaroveň. | Hrůza. Chcete zjistit, kolik je zón při cestě z Prahy do Přelouče? Vyhraďte si aspoň hodinu na studium systému pid. Jednoduché zadání startu a cíl je v apce dobře schované, ale počet zón vám stejně nesdělí. Budete studovat podmínky plné podivností a výjimek a pak hledat v titěrné mapě. A když koupíte ve zmatené apce omylem špatnou jízdenku? Nebojte, vrátit jednoduše nejde, nebo se nikde nedozvite jak. | Kupovaný předem koupená 3 měsíční jízdenka začala platit rovnou dnes, když mám ještě platný pas na 4 dní, předtím to fungovalo dobře. Dobrý podvod teda | I was charged for the tickets but I did not received them in the app | Nakup cehokoliv je naprosta amaterina. | You can plan your route, calculate your fare costs and buy ticket in one app. Alas, you cannot reserve your place in PID S-trains. Developers can implement smooth transitions between prepaid coupons. Now it is not implemented. I was offered a coupon starting from the actual day, while I had few more days prepaid. | Neustále padá. | First impression is fine, please add bank id authentication to avoid yet another credentials. | Nechápu proč tu funkci s NFC neodeberete úplně a místo toho neimplementujete ty Google Wallet lístky... nefunguje to ani u terminálu ani u revizorů | Beware that if you buy a ticket for multiple travellers, it is not possible to use a scrrenshot or download a pdf. Only the person who purchases the ticket will get a ticket with QR code on the app. | Již několikrát se mi stalo, že vymrzne vyhledávání spoje. Po stisknutí vyhledat se objeví dilaogové okno searching a nic se neděje. Dalo by se a tim něco udělat? Jinak vse funguje v pořádku. Díky. Vypadá že to pomohlo. Díky 👍 | Update2: Nepomáhá nic! Rucni aktualizace nefunguje, tlacitko zesedne a nic se nestahne. Neponaha vymazani cache, restart telefonu, reinstalace. Ani pres mobilni sit ani pres wifi. Proste tragedie! / Ohavnost. Po dalším výrazném zdražení nelze v aplikaci zakoupit jizdenky pro Středočeský kraj na jednotlivou jízdu. Skvělá práce, wow! A kdybych měl hodnotit i nové ceny, tak v době, kdy ceny energií a paliv jsou na hodnotách před krizí, nafta je dokonce levnější, dal bych 0 hvězd, kdyby to šlo. | vypada, ze to preinstalovani pomohlo, diky | Půlku doby mi vyhledávání spojení skončí dlouhým čekáním a nic. Aplikace špatně pracuje s více auty - opakovaně mi (minimálně vizuálně) prodloužila parkování u špatného auta. Celkově by bylo lepší auto zvolit pomocí drop-down menu před platbou. | Jako vazne overovaci emaily pri registraci odesilate rucne? Na vytvoreni uctu clovek aby si bral dovolenou. Aspon me sakra pustte do aplikace s hlaskou ze jsem neoveren. | Zadávám platné číslo ISIC karty, ale nechce mě to pustit (neplatná karta) | Uz podruhe se mi stalo, ze jsem zaplatil za jizdenku/jizdenky (a aktivoval je) a pak v aplikaci nebyly dostupne, prip. jen nektere. | Very poor design, if you use then ""plan root"" to check the price you need to pay, and purchase the ticket from there, of you buy more then needed tickets, they are all being validated at once and there is no way to stop the process. Also, if you do it, the validation starts from the time the software decides, if you enter to an earlier tram, you can not tell it to start 'now Bad design, bad planing. | neakceptuje moji ISIC kartu | Cannot pay with Google Pay | Perfect app, thanks to the developers 🙏 | Verification e-mail doesn't even come | Дякуємо за українізацію, але ж в меню обрання мови в чеському та англомовному інтерфейсах написано ""Український"", а це не про мову :) Виправте, будь ласка | Spomalila app, načítá dlouho. | Za 3 dňový lístok som zaplatil, v banke platbu vidím že prešla, ale lístok nemám, kupoval som vo vlaku a vošli sme práve do tunela, očakávam teda vrátenie peňazí ... peniaze boli vrátené na účet, všetko je teda v poriadku, ďakujem | The app is malfunctioning during ticket purchase, it's been the second time during the last year, that instead of buying 1 monthly pass, the app charges your account 2 times and so you buy two at once, and BOTH become activated at the same time. To return the money, you need to go PERSONALLY to their office! Ridiculous and incomprehensible!!! It's 2023, HELLO CZECH DEVELOPERS ARE YOU ONLY GOOD FOR DRINKING BEER?! 🤬 UPD. Seriously?! Contact DPP due error in your app not corrected for year?! 💩 | Just tried to register and order Litacka online. Its not working. Useless service. | Kupování kupónů atd. naprosto v pořádku, avšak nedokážu zprovoznit NFC pro použití telefonu jako kartu, což byl jeden z velkých důvodů proč jsem kupon kupoval na mobil a ne na kartu. Za to prostě musí body dolů a bylo by úžasné kdyby s tím vývojář něco dělal. | Nefunguje vyhledání spojů, do nekonečna jen načítá. Reinstalace na chvíli pomohla, po dalším spuštění opět nefunguje. | total useless app, uninstall the app immidiatly and start buying the ticket from the bus using the card. since activation of the ticket takes 2 mins checker can still fine you if you have 15 second left in activation. and there is no way you can activate the ticket immidiatly. on the other hand you can buy the ticket in the bus and it does not matter it takes 2 or 3 mins checker can not fine you. This app is the scheme to wrongfully fine the commuter. a big scam. | Užitečná aplikace a z technického hlediska a UI je celkem ok. Používám roční kupón tak neřeším ten '2 minutový countdown ' aktivace jednorázové jízdenky. Řešení není nejšťastnější když cestující potřebuje ihned nastoupit. Nový update mapy odjezdů je ok a placení parkovného (auta) je plus. | Aplikace dnes přestala fungovat po update. Otevře se a než načte zakoupenou měsíční jízdenku tak se zase sama zavře. Today the app stopped working. App opens and before loading the purchased monthly ticket it closes itself. | Regarding the new parking feature I'm wondering who was behind the idea with the car colors. The most common color of the world, the white is missing. Literally how this got missed even from QA. Update on the dev answer: yes it's difficult to distinguish but this can be takled by using name as well. I understand that doesn't play any role (only if you have the rare case of same model/different colors) but still, is a app feature and either shouldn't exist or be proper. | Je hezké že zaměstnávají invalidy. Ale mentálne retardovaní by opravdu neměly pracovat na oddělení komunikace se zákazníky!!! A na oddělení vývoje to taky není o nic lepší. Příšerná aplikace! Příšerný přístup k platícím zákazníkům!!! | Funguje. | Poslední verze je neskutečně pomalá. Téměř nepoužitelné | There is no way to activate the ticket immediately so I activate it as soon as I see the bus coming but this time the check was straight when I entered the bus causing the ticket still having 30 seconds left to activate costing me a 1000 crowns! | Android App doesn't show the departure schedule at the stops. iOS App has no problem with it. | Dvouminutový odpočet do aktivace listku bez jakéhokoliv upozornění předem je naprosto pitomý nápad. Jestli je to způsob, jak vybrat od turistů na pokutách, tak bych to označila za podvod. Používala jsem podobné aplikace v různých evropských městech a žádná to neměla. DPP evidentně víc zajímá výběr pokut, než komfort cestujících.

"KB Klíč","The KB Klíč app verifies your identity and safely logs you into MojeBanka online banking and Komerční banka's other online apps. You don't have to enter a texted code and you also authorise payments through the app.

You need the following for KB Klíč activation:
- KB ID, which you will find in the Electronic Signature Agreement. You can also use your username/email
- An activation code that you will receive at a KB branch or when you log into mujprofil.kb.cz otherwise than via KB Klíč

The activation guide is available at 
https://www.kb.cz/en/new-login-methods#kbklic

Set the PIN on the occasion of activation. You can set up your fingerprint if your phone supports them. Komerční banka will never see your fingerprints; they are retained in a secure repository in the phone.

If your phone is connected to the internet the request to confirm the activation will be received automatically in your phone. Check and confirm the request. If offline, select 'The device is not connected to the internet' option in your computer. Using the KB Klíč app, scan the pictorial code from the computer's screen. Then confirm the code by the PIN or fingerprint. Finally, type the generated code in your computer.

Please note: If you enter an incorrect PIN five times KB Klíč blocks access. You will then activate the apps using an activation code that you will receive in an ATM, at a KB branch or after logging into mujprofil.kb.cz otherwise than via KB Klíč.

KB Klíč will not work for you if you have reinstalled software on your phone and your platform (root) is therefore not protected.

Money down the drain. Foreign online banks manage security in much smoother way e.g.: N26, Revolut, Trade Republic, etc. | Cool | Very good and nice comunication.. | Při snaze o aktivaci mi dokolečka říká: ""The scanned code is not intended for this device or user"". Tohle fakt není v pohodě fungování.... :-/ | Works as expected | Je v pohodě. Lepší než třeba od GEMoney bank. | ""we apologize but the action is not available at the moment, try again in a few minutes"" useless, unable to pay with my own card | Vse OK.

I think that it is a bug and it makes me feeling uncomfortable - if there are bugs, how secure it can be? It also does not help that the bank dismissed my concerns, saying that observed incidents somehow prove app's security. Such BS! Obviously, they have no idea what they are talking about... I am going to file a complaint. No doubt about that. | The numeric keyboard (for inputting the PIN) is *vertically* very small. I have to retype more than half of the times. I often ""mistype up"" or ""mistype down"", i.e. 1<-> 4 or 2<->5 or 3<->6. It seems this is an aesthetic decision but at the expense of usability. | Celá internet banka KB je jedna velká nepřehledná hrůza.

Very convenient. | PROS: +Supports English +Works better the the main KB app. CONS: -Why does one need to install two apps to manage one bank account? -The authentication scheme is ridiculous. | Ok | Good app | Výbornej nápad. Místo zadávání pinu přímo do hlavní aplikace, musíme mít 2 aplikace. Stupiditus titanicus | It would be nice if this application can send me notifications (only) about bank transactions. I don't want to install the separate banking app. Similarly like the application ""Mobilní klíč egovernment"" can send notifications about new messages in your Datová schránka. | Does exactly what it suppose to | Just works... | Great | Literally terrible. A student could probably do a better job. They give you a pin code for the app but the code is wrong, it blocks you out after a few tries and it tells you to call a number. You call this number, wait half an hour only for them to tell you to go visit the bank instead of resolving the issue over phone like a normal person. This should be a question of ten minutes instead you have to go through hoops cause the app was made by people who have no idea how to code. | Top banka,all recommended!! | Fast | stupid procedure for re-new of the login to app and key app in ATM, change device via SMS not working (error msg appears) - updated: ID is as in internet banking, not mobile banking .... | Amazingly fast | Solid | Had problems with transfering to another phone...caused by versions of apps on both phones weren't completely same | Perfect | Dělá co má bez problémů | Perfect and continuously improving... | Best app, easy to use and convenient 👌 | Aplikace i banka jsou naproste fiasko. Prihlaseni do bankovnictvi na webu vyzaduje potvrzeni z aplikace KB klic, do ktere se nejde prihlasit bez kodu, ktery ziskate jen na pobocce nebo v bankomatu, coz s proslou kartou nejde a o vikendy pobocky nefunguji. Offline prihlaseni je nemozne. Moznost poslat SMS kod, coz ostatni banky umi, zde neexistuje. Tahle vikendova banka je naprosto nepouzitelna. | Excellent | Good experience and no stress working with it | Nice one | Works well | Very good | Good | Very lovely and easy to use applications. I love it. | Its working good | Zatím vše ok 🙂 | Funkcnost bez problemu, mechanismus racionalni | Process to reset this is beyond annoying. | When it works it kinda does what it is supposed to do, but I was already facing couple of issues in 7 days using it: - roll-on was painfull, on the branch it was first not possible to reach the system for 1h, then during entering the activation it was complaining about missing internet connection (which was working browsing the KB site) during entering a pin, and I had to gave up activation of the fingerprint because it was not working - next day after roll-on somebody asked me over phone to identify over KB klic, but his name and autenticity was not even displayed on the screen, so it was not possible to tell whether it is KB accountant or some vishing - now I needed to migrate to another phone, activation code worked, but the process got stucked unfinished again due to ""missing internet connection"" nonesense during pin entry (I was at home on strong wifi, everything else was working at that time) App is now unauthenticated on the old phone, but not working on the new phone and activation key can't be entered twice | Super | Rapid and easy access ! | Preinstalovany android, zabudol som vypytat reset, jedina aplikace ktora se nedokaze obnovit cez heslo + sms ale musim na pobocku :( | Nepouzitelna, neprehledna, user no friendly | Fast nice offer | Very good | very good | Wow | Works reliably. | Great usage | Snadné a intuitivní ovládání. | Přestalo to fungovat. | ok | Aplikace funguje dobře. Jen mi vadí, že je možné ji mít pouze na jednom telefonu. | Great app | Great | Works great | Security issue: Upozornění, že uživatel nemá potvrzovat přihlášení, pokud jej k tomu někdo vyzval telefonicky je překryto systémovým okýnkem s výzvou k přihlášení pomocí biometrických údajů.Tj. já si ten důležitý text nemám šanci přečíst, pokud se přihlašuji pomocí biometrie. | Nadčasové | Great app, extremely intuitive and quick | Just works. | Perfektní. | Just why?? | Straightforward, easy to use | Love it | I think this app is great. Easy to use and efficient. But like all technology, when something goes wrong, you're screwed. For example, you forget your password or you lose your phone then it can be quite a nuisance. | Bad. Is really annoying I have to confirm every single payment with a pin when I do multiple payments at the same time. | Very secure and safe | Amazing application, great insights and constant updates. | Pekny clovek je zavreny v recku skrz karantenu a ted nemuzu ani platit protoze v recku neni kb bankomat abych si mohla vxzvednou heslo fakt super napad... | Works as expected | Good experience | good app | easy- I 'm happy | It's fine for banking. | very efficient | Nothing works. Constant bugs | Yeah it works pretty well, has security policy (no screen capture), no root checks and biometrics are supported | Good | Is easier, friendly and more secured. | Nice | It s horrible how much apps and emails and sms and pins and codes you have to use to be able to open and work with account :( I say this in previous bank and they change to use onli ine app. I wish KB do the same. | EDIT: integrace je v plánu, to mění můj pohled na věc ;) | Does it's job without problems | Not user friendly at all | OK! | It is fast of paying online. Very great | proč umožnit uživateli použít libovolnou 2-factor authenticator appku, když mu můžeme vnutit naši vlastní, která jen zabírá místo a jinak k ničemu není. a aby toho nebylo málo, tak aktivně blokuje klávesnici mého správce hesel. | Prostě funguje | Quick and easy payment confirmations | Easy to use. | Feels safe and steady. Good work guys. | Presented in Czech and English, has the occasional bug where English doesn't always work. Otherwise I'm very satisfied. | Payment notifications for approval come often with delays. Multiple login and password instead of having a single sign on. Different app from mobile banking | Easy to use | Zatím funguje spolehlivě. Spokojenost | It works | Easy to use | Works well! | Works the way it was intended. | Terrible | Velmi rychlé a intuitivní. | Jako vsechbo od KB... | Easy and fast | Awful. First you block update of mojebanka with this app. I installed it all good 3 month ago. You didn't give me option to install it on second phone like George. Shame on you. Than you stop sending sms for online payments. Double shame on you. During last Internet payment you ask it to confirm via kb app and when i access it i find message i need to get activation key. This is plain stupid. To finish online payment i have to visit atm to get new key? How much more problems you can make???? | Love it | Fast and easy authentication. | Super, rychlé a spolehlivé. | Works well enough | Špatný. Oproti předchozím certifikátům velké snížení zabezpečení. Ale jinou možnost člověk nemá. | Works well. Only I don't understand why you have to select YES and then fingerprint. It would be better if you could just authenticate with fingerprint | Funguje jak má... 😊 | Hezký nápad a používá se to příjemně. Z webového prohlížeče už ale není možné zablokovat mobilní bankovnictví v případě ztráty mobilu (na blokační linku se totiž blbě volá bez mobilu a doteď se tam dalo dostat přes prohlížeč díky certifaku) | Efficient and effective app | The application should be refreshed manually in order to approve a pending for payment item, e.g.in George a newly awaiting for approval payment pops-up automatically. | Convenient | neskutečně otravná záležitost EDIT: Otravné je to proto, že to cpete všem. Proč musí být přihlášení na můj téměř prázdný účet tak složité? Chápal bych to u účtů s významnějším obnosem. | Obecně aplikace funguje dobře. Jen by neměla zapomenout nastavení otisku při aktualizaci. PIN už jsem v hlavě neměl. Vzhledem k tomu, že možnosti odblokování při pobytu mimo ČR neexistují a oficiální stránky KB mají špatné informace (KB Klíč nelze získat online, viz kb.cz/cs/nove-zpusoby-prihlaseni), budu muset pár měsíců vydržet s přihlašováním přes bezpečnostní heslo. Škoda. Edit: S infolinkou jsme nic nevymyslel, ale milý přístup. Pouceni ostatnim: vždy mít víc nezávislých způsobu přístupu. | Funguje | Good | Lehká na pochopení. | Confirmation of various operations is made easier. | The best mobile banking application on the market. | quick & easy | One of the biggest reasons I still am a client of kb is their mobile app. Def the best in czechia. | Super! | Good app | works well, authorize by fingerprint instead of SMS | It works, but it's a pain to use. The annoying PIN keypad moves the number buttons around randomly on every use! You have to hunt them down. | Works quite well. I'm impressed | USELESS, SO MUCH WORSE THEN CERTIFICATES. JUST ANNOYING. | Works perfectly | Very good | Easy to use | Good | Easy to use, loading is smooth and quick. | Comfortable","{""1"":1647,""2"":298,""3"":514,""4"":2213,""5"":24615}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Komerční banka, a.s.","6452965982168751355","mojebanka@kb.cz","https://www.kb.cz",,"https://www.kb.cz/cs/ochrana-osobnich-udaju","6452965982168751355","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pShN8UU7XzG7DV89xi3Fc-4stkdZhw-eMeolOQrFI-6Nx1XFeIzZBnWXb0qWr4HmalEb","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/i8jYCAZoaUm8X1SKo1chwT6ry1cpkLCoZiPj97Fo61t9gikoCMYnEvfGEPxdk9oBqA","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Lt9L-6NqQlUGZ7spd9A4hvpQ7Yb5tfKFxuBt4Ok6r9tD8nv6l5lsvvuE2GheGzBmhR0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ITsXj81x_lAjL9kNVt8ttMmbPEkk5jW6fQjkdWMl9W66kQNVrLrg578xNHUtj0D6CtE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9u5CddrZWggASYVvwuCTWFeHi4sKAdRGxOZavIx92MW-esMutVBt6D2JDpZywK6PM0U"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/t0c_2TfSpY4bEacHYW2WUF71a1VdYNhEDf6oaHOXmz52j4h3oHfXZzKPmjZLKIO_ABA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3V0r2h9JmhI52r8baEBUkgdrXv0oOKTI0wGcqHa3kg7yaDrinGfdj1SNjJrqtHVlM71"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hRanO6aNwFobkpAxxfOifC5X1X5BR0D4kl-dG1ogKKy6FaOFWtsl2YobxwIU2YMmyK0""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 18, 2018",1709814365000,"3.8.0","Bug fixing.","[""The app keeps saying there was a new fingerprint entered (and disables the fingerprints) while there was no attempt to enter any fingerprint.

Strašně dlouho jsem čekal, než dorazí nějaký kód. Když nic nepřicházelo, aplikaci jsem zavřel. Kód nakonec dorazil. Když jsem aplikaci otevřel, chce to znovu verifikovat mobil. 😞 Na tyhle věci nemám náladu. | It doesn't actually show any useful info. No map with courier lication like DPD does. Just the same info from email repeated, nothing else. | Broken app, crashes when trying to register a phone number. Untested tragedy by development. 27/02/2024 Still no fix. | The app crashes during the sign up. Again and again.... | The set up is annoying, the e-mail takes for Ever to receive... | The app is turning off by itself | Nuti instalovat appku pro jednoduchou zmenu doruceni, s overenim emailu a cisla je to na 5min a pak 3s kliknuti a potvrzeni. User experince na urovni ztraty casu. Kdybych si mohl vybrat dorucovaci firmu, tak vyberu rozhodne konkurenci nez tyhle klauny | The app crashes during sign up after typing in phone number for verification. If opened again, the whole process is deleted and you start over, leading again into another crash. Tried everything, force closing, cleaning cache, uninstalling and installing, nothing worked. If we take into account that the ""only way"" to change the time and place of your arriving order is through the app it almost feels illegal to limit costumers this way. Tl;dr: Dont try this app, not even the company is trying. | During registration crashes, every time. Impossible to register and without registration useless... | Crashes after entering phone number | Useless, it crashes immediately | Works as intended with no issues | App crashes during the setup. It asks for phone number and that's its death already. | App works fine, but delivery company is absolutely useless with couriers that don't care about getting their job done, and the app can't fix that. App doesn't provide anything useful besides information that you already get with text messages and emails. And it doesn't account for couriers to have a mind of their own in regards to when you should be expecting them to arrive. | app doesn't work at all. | Don't send you sms that a package is ready for a pickup, just an email that it was sent back to sender as it wasn't picked up. | I would like to say all of the bad words about your delivery service and application. Why in God's name do you not have who the sender is next to the tracking number? Who made this app? A child? | Aplikace neumožňuje ani otevření boxu ani zobrazení pinu pro otevření. Což by se zrovna hodilo v momentě, kdy z nějakýho důvodu nechodí SMSky s pinem | So you have to install an app just to check where your package is... Seems very forced and annoying, but OK. But after installing it, they want you to verify your phone number, but the verification code never comes. Absolute trash. | Setup is not working. App crashes right after I type in phone number. | Confirmation mail just wouldn't come for any of my mail boxes. And button for sending other one doesn't work. And I couldn't use it without it or anything | dobrý den, pokaždé když zadám telefonní číslo, aplikace spadne, takže mám sice 10 ověřovacích kódů, ale jsou mi k ničemu. zřejmě by to chtělo malinko doladit :-) | Aplikaci trvá 15 minut než pošle email s ověřením a když už přijde tak je už odkaz neplatný protoze stihl expirovat. Nepoužitelné | SMS to get in takes like 10 minutes to come. Then the code is not working. | can't use it at all - I open the app, enter phone number and then it crashes | Hrůza | Absolutely useless | Zásilka se mi nechce otevřít v aplikaci. Detail zasilky je jen šedý, když ho otevřu a přes web na mobilu nelze nic udělat. | Ceska posta je oproti teto sluzbe zlata. Nechapu proc si musim kvuli zmene data doruceni baliku instalovat aplikaci, v ktere to pak stejne nejde. Spolehlivost dorucovani je uzasna. V jednom pripade mi nikdo nedal vedet, ze mi prijde balicek a nasledne mi prislo upozorneni, ze ho mam ulozeny na vydejnim miste desitky kilometru od bydliste. V dalsim pripade, kdyz jsem rekl kuryrovi, ze nejsem doma, tak mi brecel do telefonu, ze opetovne doruceni ho bude stat penize. | Well it doesn't have real time GPS tracking and schedule like for example DPD or something similar... Rather disappointing because the app is relatively useless, just knowing the delivery timeframe is not enough, which is already provided by email. What's the point of installing the app as a buyer. | Forced registration in application? For what reason? I have parcell number, refference nunber and that's enough! Thanks, but i'll pass this. First and last time. | It asked you for mail and phone verification but does not provide pin for particular package pickup so you still need to carry all mail or sms (note that the pin is sent only once but planty other spam reminders almost every day) | App froze in the middle of setup, wouldn't send confirmation email for so long that it had expired by the time it finally came. Also, didn't ever want this, got roped into downloading it because Allegro is apparently too cheap to also run a webpage with info on packages. Put me off the whole service. Thanks, but no, thanks, never again | Doufal jsem ze uvidim polohu kuryra, tj. nejake presnejsi info o tom kdy zasilka dorazi, ale nedozvite se nic vic nez je na webu. Naprosto zbytecna aplikace, v podstate malware... Edit (odpoved Adamovi z WE|DO): To co pisete neni pravda. V aplikaci je videt stav zasilky, napriklad zda je na ceste nebo v depu, coz se dozvim i z webu. Neni zde zadna informace o jeji presnejsi poloze, napriklad kde priblizne je kuryr nebo za jak dlouho ke mne dorazi. | To bojujete s českou poštou o nejhorší servis? | There is no parcel tracking, just the same info you get in SMS | Repeatedly told me that I don't have any package to receive even though I had | Neni mozne ani zacit pouzivat aplikaci. Verification email bud neprijde vubec nebo se zpožděnim a jiz expirovanym linkem. | App is not in English. The website is | Zbytečná aplikace. | Naprosto odporný přístup společnosti, která vyžaduje použití mobilní aplikace k pouhé změně termínu doručení. Aplikace neopodstatněle vyžaduje potvrzení mobilního čísla a emailu. Jsou společnosti, které si zákazníků váží a umožní obsloužit zásilku jednoduše skrze web. Wedo mezi ně nepatří. | Not able to register. Did not get verification email | Vyžadováno jak mobilní číslo, tak mail. SMS přišla, odkaz na mail ani po opakovaném zaslání ne (včetné kontroly spamu). Takže necunkční. | Nejde sa ani prihlasit, zasielju nejde sledovat online, ale len v appke, do ktorej nejde prihlasenie, nechapem ako moze niekto dobrovolne vyuzivat wedo | Worst app that exists, the fact that you have to download this trash to change your order is insane to me | Verifiy either mail or phone! Verify both shouldbe optional? | Aktuálně pro Vás nic nemáme... přitom mi vezete balík, škoda. (ano, email a telefon je zadaný stejný jako u zásilky) | Why do I need to install your app to track my items? I should also be able to track my items using your website. The app is not available in English. | nemůžu si ani ověřit účet protože tahle píčovina mi nepošle email | Received sms with info on my parcel and link to download the app to get more info and follow my parcel. Upon installing the app there's literally not one bit of additional information. No need to download the app.. I really wish we could get past the 3-4 hour window received from delivery companies. Don't tell me it can't be narrowed down to 30-60 minutes in this day and age with all the tech we have available. | Why to ask your customers to download the app for absolutely everything if it does not work? THE WORST APP FOR DELIVERIES. | Taky se musim přidat k předchozím. Ponechám stranou neschopnost společnosi doručit zásilku tak jak je deklarováno. 1) aplikace vyžaduje e-mail ale zasilku z něho nenačte, na to potřebuje tel. Jenže když vám někdo pošle zásilku na jiný tel, můžete tak akorát přepínat mezi čísly. 2) Všude cpou že je aplikace potřeba na sledování a pak sem píšou že to není třeba. 3) tak primitivní věc jako sledovat zásilku dle čísla to neumí. Zato ciza aplikace to zvladne :-D Čekal bych víc | opakovane to po mne chce aktivovat aplikaci a pritom v ni nenajdu ani pin pro vyzvednuti => potreti uz jsem to neaktivoval, ale odinstaloval. PS - Pokud ve sve odpovedi naznacujete, ze ta aplikace neni ke vsemu tomu ani dostacne zabezpecna pro ulozeni pinu k zasilce, tak mam asi jeste o duvode mene, abych se ji pokousel zprovoznit. | Don't know how else to rise an issue. 20mins till I get email to verify and then the verification link does not work. I will update rating when this is fixed. | Nefunguje ověření emailu, takže se do app vůbec nedostanete... Edit: Spam jsem kontroloval. Emaily došly po půlnoci a linky už byly neplatné. Podobně email o doručování mi přišel pár hodin po doručení. | K ničemu. Když už přijde ověřovací kód na email po asi půl hodině, tak stejně nefunguje. | Incompetent delivery service that makes promises about deliveries and is not capable of keeping them. Also, instead of an interactive website, they force you to download their app and input personal data to be able to make any changes to your delivery. Sad. | V aplikaci nešlo přesměrovat zásilku do výdejního místa, musel jsem kvůli tomu otravovat kurýra, který ji tam přesměroval. Když to umí kurýr, proč to nejde v aplikaci? V aplikaci není vidět kód pro vyzvednutí zásilky. Celá WeDo služba je pro mě momentálně na úrovni PPL, DPD, čili ne moc použitelná. | Aplikace pěkná, se společností jsem také neměl žádné problémy. Jen jsem byl nucen instalovat, protože sice máte webové stránky, ale na mobilu nejde po zadání údajů zásilky kliknout na tlacitko ""vyhledat""... | Zbytečná aplikace a celkově příšerná služba. Zásilka měla přijít zítra, ale kurýr si vesele přijede dneska když nejsem doma a ještě se mu to nelíbí. Žádné upozornění mi nepřišlo. Tak si nainstaluju tuhle aplikaci abych předělal termín - nejdřív nepřišel potvrzovací email, pak tam vidím že jsou v aktivních zásilkách i nějaké rok staré už dávno doručené. Předělat dodání stejně nemůžu protože je zásilka pořád aktivní, takže to asi budu muset sledovat celý den než to v depu odkliknou. Supersračka! | Joining all the 1 star reviews. I just need to know when the parcel will arrive. You don't need my phone and email to show me that. Update after app-dev reply: then why do you send SMS with the link to the app and not with the link to the web?? | Problém už jen při registraci, vůbec mi to neposlalo mail pro ověření. A to jsem to zkoušel hodněkrát ! | Dalsia zbytocna aplikacia ktora mohla byt web. Namiesto linku na zasielku ma nutite stiahnut si tuto nefunkcnost. Viem ze v sms je sledovacie cislo a viem ze ked to vykopirujem tak mi to ukaze vsetko na webe. Je tak tazke prilozit link ktory to spravi sam? | their web is forcing me to download this, the web is nonfunctional | Nesmyslně složitý proces pro získání stavu zásilky. Proč prostě nemůžu dostat odkaz na webovou stránku. Tak jako to dělají všichni ostatní obchodníci/přepravci. | Zbytečná aplikace. Sledování zásilky ukazuje jiná data než webový portál. 3 dny čekám na balík, důvod - výdejní box mimo provoz. Aplikace ukazuje plánované doručení v minulosti a že je balík na cestě do depa. Z aplikace není možné balík přesměrovat na jiný výdejní box. Absurdní v dnešní době ... | Nepoužitelné, pouze pro informaci = zdá se, že to neumí nabídnout více informací než člověk obdrží v SMS.

Can't watch it. Two movies in a row ! Unbelievable ! | google translate 🤦 | keep up the good work guys | The application and service level ia absolute garbage. Always lagging, no support on devices, constant unexplicable streaming errors. This is not even close to the popular providers. Fix your stuff guys, because at this stage even Yellowstone won't sell it. | You increase the subscription price , ok. Its time to see the improve of quality - 4k , hdr ! You are the only streaming service that doesnt bring even one 4k movie/series. But the price increases to same or more as other streaming services that offers this. P.S: for the brainless people that says they have a subscription with 2€/month for life : its 50% discount for standard price. Standard price was 3.99€.Soon it will be 5.99€ so you will pay 2.99€.If or when the price will be 10€ you pay 5€. | Stutters and makes everything else stutter on tv. had to unistall to be able to use my tv normally. please fix edit: it's been a year since original review and nothing changed...avoid this app/service | Audio is beyond horrible. | google tv app is choppy glitchy, doesnt crash as much as the regular android app. but net result is, horrible apps, unwatchable. i cancelled because just a waste of money. also no app for xbox. | I love watching as it is the only streamer with certain content. How about adding an I would like to watch but is not available yet section? Somewhere in feedback menu. Also why only support chrome browser to change payment and other advanced setting? Not fair to force a specific browser on users. | lags...no audio... | no more sound | I don't know what happened but today on 13 of March I don't have any sound from the application on my Philips TV.every other streaming application work perfectly. | no audio at all on Android TV. such a disappointment | Aplicația de pe TV nu funcționează corespunzător în sensul ca filmele nu au sunet, nu înțeleg de ce. Am testat toate platformele și doar în skyshowtime întâmpin aceasta problema. Ca ""remediere"" trebuie sa dau din aplicația de pe telefon pe TV sa vad filmele cum trebuie, adică sa aibă și sunetul. | Top movie | Love This 💕 | excellent streaming | Stutter and crash often on multiple different TVs... | so far ok app. but the image quality is not nearly as good as fx Netflix. I'm on a 1Gbit connection, so bandwith isn't the reason. | Select English language, plays in English for 2 seconds, then switches to some random la language! | The app runs smoothly and it's worth it! I'd only recommend to make a playstation app, so that it can be usable on playstation. | On a old android 5.1 It doesn't play video if I change audio language. | Very limited in the number of movies and series. Other competitors offer more for the same amount of money. After paying a subscription for a year now, I expected things will change. Audio and video quality is poor too. Disappointed. If nothing will change in the upcoming months will consider to leave the platform. | Płatne | Perfect for my travels | Casting to tv does not allow to change language. Really annoying | Subtitle is too small to read it properly | Han cambiado el pago de la gente que empezo la subscription al principio, de 2.99 a 3.99 al mes, decepcionante para la variedad de cosas que tienen... cancelare | It is not able to play any video | Din 23 aprilie 2024 oferta pe viata cu 2 euro nu va mai exista, deci nu e pe viata, mincinoșilor, pretul va creste, la 3 euro. E timpul sa renuntam la abonamente. Sunteți niste mincinosi, sper sa dati faliment. | Gran oferta de nuevas y clasicos. Peeero; la plataforma esta mal optimizada; SIN CARGA DE BUFER, no compatible con dispositivos medianamente antiguos... por estas cosas seguimos viendo Netflix. No parece tan dificil de entender...O dispones de una conexion excelente o preparate para cortes frecuentes. Se ve que han invertido en los ultimos taquillazos, pero yo dedicaria parte de ese dinero al reproductor y la compatibilidad. Aun les queda camino.... Sin duda alguna tu dinero esta mejor en disney | Painter | Gold | Android app does not work with Chromebook as it opens only with phone layout. Can you please support resizable and tablet layout on Chromebooks? | It jams terribly on a Philips TV. Chromecast casting works even worse than the installed app. | ""Woman in the wall"", released completely in sept 2023, ...in platform available only 2 episodes...!?! | Cannot manage my payment preferences on my tablet. There is no way to know if all episodes are available of a season, I only binge wach, do not want to watch episodes weekly. On my lg tv the sound quality is poor, only dolby surround while other streaming services have dolby digital. Menu is confusing as well, pressing left/right to switch tabs scrolls up/down. Subtitles lag behind audio for some content. Amount of content could be better,lots of old movies not much new. | I cancelled my subscribtion after using this app for 3 hours ... pathetic, this is a scam. | I created an account and I couldn't see the content, every time I log in after I activated the account it says to me to make a new subscription, I talked with the help support and they said to me that I made the account on the wrong email, when I activated my account with my good email. Just some thieves that lie to you. I do not recommend at all. | Mostly just black screen whenever i want to watch something, on chromebook. Will randomly crash or freeze, and no its not my connection. Most shows and films can be found on other services and cheaper. So probably wont be coming back to this one. | Some issues with this app. First of all it can drain your battery in a couple of hours compared with other streaming apps that you hardly feel were running. It also makes the phone really hot. And second it crashes oh so often. Just crashes with a generic message. | Wat een ouden troep zonde van je geld | Its not working on my tv | A lot of content for a good price but the experience is terrible - subpar unresponsive app, few controls, playback constantly freezing even with a fully downloaded movie / episode. It's been quite a while and there has been no improvement. | you could copy some ok , platform like. paramount. is the company not working for the same people. instead is a copy of peacock platform. which is one of the worsts. | Very poor quality of the application. Installed it on EON TV Box with latest updates - the app itself loads but playing content leads to frequent TV flashing(black screen) like every 10-15 seconds. I wondered why it is so mu cheaper than HBO and Disney+- apparently the poor quality is the reason. | trash app | Audio is desynced on Star Trek Deep Space 9 season 3 episode 11. I don't actually think the app is bad, I just didn't find a place to report the issue. Guessing that bad reviews are read more often. I'll remove it in about a week, regardless if it's fixed or not | Very unstable app. Selecting multiple downloads will crash app. Start of paused player will crash app. List of episodes is not fully available on tablet in landscape mode ... Please fix this prototype ... | It's bad, and I can't cancel my membership | It doesn' work fine at all with my Philips Ambilight. In fact, it made my tv freeze in YouTube. I thought it broke. Then made all apps to stutter. The movie stutter in the app, too. I unistalled it and everything is fine now. I also have it on an LG tv and it works fine there. I am pretty dissapointing. | Nem tölti le az appot, kb 10 szer próbáltam két eszközön is | Love the content and app. Works well on all my devices | Horrendous autoplay of next title, that can't be turned off. | there is no app for Vidda - Hisense TV 😔 | 👍 Good | How to change the language to something other than the country where I'm staying | Edit: Language update happened! Please push an update to start using the device language instead of language based on geographical location. | Great content. Stable app | 2 euro for life :)) best deal ever | Bad captions, was watching trilogy and it just disappeared without notice, totally just removed out of existence. Nice... Technically app decent with chromecast. | Great app, please let me watch also with Brazilian Portuguese audio! | So, so terrible! Used to work fine on my Chromebook, and now it is miniscule like a tiny phonescreen and cannot be resized to fit my full screen! Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it doesn't help. Customer service have proven to be of NO help previously with other issues, so I guess this is a waste of time now, and I will just unsubscribe. How is it possible that people can take money for a job so poorly done? | Terrible app. Everytime i go back home during playback it freezes the whole phone. I have s23 ultra so no cheap phone. | It's exactly like Netflix or almost you need to pay to wach I'd rather pay for Netflix. before i decided to change the app I used before surfnet is way better its free | Not optimized for an android phone. (Keeps playing when you get a call, switches pages between 'episodes - more like this - extras' when try to scroll down. ) and the download files are unnecessarily large. Good content and well worth the price. | Can't turn off autoplay next episode, so you can't watch the credits. | Fix the sound, NO Dolby of any type. Philips TV and Denon AVR-X2700H | The app is faaaaast | The app is utter garbage. Stutters, buffers, skips. Please fix. Starting to feel like a scam. | The app keeps crashing like crazy, even navigation is difficult; content is not bad but somewhat limited. Happy to keep using if you fix the app. | Slow, not good UX | excelente. | It neither has an app for fire stick nor allows mirroring from the tablet. Therefore I have to either watch it on a small screen or connect an HDMI from the computer as if we're in 2006. Pathetic. | please upgrade the content audio with Dolby 5.1. I just saw a movie with 2.0 with original English sound while there was 5.1 polish or Hungarian secondary sound | love it very good | netflix from wish | Not working on h96max | Cannot save downloads properly to external storage. Basic feature. | App works flawless, and I found so much to watch on it. Very sarisfied. | Very Good | I installed the app on my Philips TV but got really bad stuttering. We have not experienced this with any other streaming service and I contacted customer support. After a few basic steps such as restart they blamed my TV even though every other streaming app works fine. I asked if they had any known issues regarding stuttering and lag and they said no. After reading reviews here it seems they are either oblivious or uninformed of the performance issues in the app. I hope this is fixed soon. | This app is 100% peeing in to paying customers' cereals. You can't cancel your subscription from the app. You have to navigate yourself to the website and sign in and cancel it from there. But lo and behold! It's not that easy if you try to do it on your mobile which has the app also since when you sign in on the website, your mobile automatically open the app... | It works but audio and video formats seem to be poor. No Dolby Atmos, no Dolby Vision, no HDR. I was however able to get the experience to Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Overall UX works. | You really need to improve the quality of the image and sound for the content. It's terrible...It is 2024, what about 4k, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos? | Awesome app 💕 | no Xbox app | Reseña actualizada enero 2024. Aún hay problemas al añadir ciertas películas o series a mis favoritas, da error y no se guarda, incluso después de varios intentos. La calidad del audio y video sigue faltando, muy debajo de todas las otras plataformas de streaming. | Just downloaded the app, cannot watch a single movie..the movie is loading for ages, when it does after 30 sec it happens again..why paying at all?! | I watch over Chromecast and works fine. Also watching on my android is no problem. But I recently purchased a projector wambo X5 with android 9 some kind of TV OS. It starts to flicker when I want to sign IN. An crashes the app when hitting a play button. Would be awesome if it will be fixed in the future. As I said Chromecast in HDMI projector is OK. Thanks in advance | Really good streaming service with excellent customer relations. | 👍 | Love the app but can we get some settings for subtitles ? For some reason for this app the subtitles comes with black background and takes a lot of space. Maybe we can get some subtitles with no background and have a font size to pick from. Thanks | Great movies and series and I've never had any problems with the app. | app seems unstable/losing connection to the TV when streaming | Atrocious app | No way to remove titles from continue watching | fast becoming my favorite streaming App | should work on firestick normally... not woth workarounds | So now I need to learn czech in order to use the application, just because skyshowtime wants that! Where is the english interface? I prefer Original English titles of 5h3 movies!! This is ridiculous! | awesome | Transformers 2023....terribles.... | Will autoplay anything.... have shows, films i don't want to watch stuck in my view list. Needs more options so you can remove stuff. | I'm trying to watch Yellowjackets 2 and the screen is so dark that I will stop watching and cancel the subscription. And no, it is not a phone' setting issue. | bc ok | Very buggy, especially the subtitles. Rather disappointed they you removed the Friday the 13th movies. | generally ok. but there are problems with the subtitles, the settings specified in the webpage are not always respected(eg. a black background for the subtitles). in fact, it's quite silly that such settings are not accessible in the app directly and that a webpage has to be accessed! | In aplicația de Android nu am reusit sa vizionez nici măcar 10 sec (din nici un film/serial). Apar coduri de eroare pentru care nu există suport. Aplicația cere acces la locație, ceea ce nu mi se pare normal. Consider ca neputând accesa serviciile si fără acces la conținutul digital ""oferit"" sunt eligibil de refund si chiar vreau banii inapoi. Edit la sugestia dezvoltatorului : Link-ul sugerat nu are absolut nici o relevanță pentru problema cu care ma confrunt!!! | stopped working too many times Christmas day | Worst is impossible. We can't watch on the tv because you don't have the application for Samsung tv, and on the telephone the streaming is so poor we can't view a single film . I'm sorry I payed you a month. | This app/service is really bad! Not supported on PS not supported on Samsung tv's app stores, doesn't work from the tv browser and cannot stream from phone to tv. In a nutshell you can use it on your phone or laptop only. Save yourself some time and avoid creating an account and paying for a service that you can't use. Absolute no customer support from their end. | no proper surround soundand the worst part is it's still lagging | It is the only app out streaming platforms. (Hbo, netflix, disney+) that is continuously playing if you fall asleep, for example, and drains all your battery. Do something about this? It's stupid and a waste of resources. | clean and quick | By far the worst streaming app. It is painful to use it. | Android TV user (Philips). Occasional stutters of video playback are just not acceptable. Other streaming apps (Netflix, HBO Max) work fine. | Unlike many other apps, this one works | buggy | cannot open the app for 3 days now, keeps crashing and reloading. ugh | It's Good | i have the same issue..., can't use it in landscape mode, and can't resize it on chrome os. | Still no 4K. Downloads expire so fast I can't even download something before a short trip and be able to watch it when I'm coming back. Worst VOD in Poland :( | Limited content in the Netherlands. Some really nice films but dreadful streaming quality in the evening (_not_ an issue with _my_ network). Resorted to downloading to workaround it. | Good movies and shows. Amazing price. It could have more programs for kids. | very poor aop conpared w Netflix. even HBO is (a bi) better | can't disable the subtitles on mobile. I click disable, it goes back to english. on the desktop, the quality is not even close to high quality 1080p. I'm watching on MacOS with Safari, on the latest MacBook pro, I should get at least 1440p, the quality is terrible! | This is a garbage app, you download movies so You can watch them online, for some reason they expire and when you want to watch them because you have no internet, you can't because they are expired. | nu are dublare în limba romana la filmele pentru copii | Doesn't run real full screen, on the camera side theres a huge black bar unlike on the Iphone where it's actually full screen. | This piece can change system language anything but English | App doesn't work anymore. It says that I'm offline even though I'm not. All other streaming platforms work fine. | muy bueno. | keep up the good work | UI is ugly and terrible to navigate | Amazing 👑💎♥️🇺🇸 | 1.13.0 - another update that doesn't change or fix anything. SkyShowtime & Peacock app developers, what are you doing all these months? // 8 months after launch (1 year in other countries) they still didn't fix the subtitles customization and display problem. Shame. | Update: downgraded from 2 stars to one, officially worst streaming app(not working for now) Good content poor app On Phillips android tv i can barely watch something it frezzes every 3 seconds, update urgently needed | Subtitles essentially do not work... EDITED over a year later... Removed rest of that. Finally now most subtitle related things actually work. That's something any single decent programmer would have done in a week. But they are really not interested in the non-USA users, but still they finally got it working in a near decent manner. Raising 1 to 3 stars | can't play video on android projector | Do not subscribe, you'll die trying to find how to unsubscribe their mediocre service. | Hangs on my Nest Max. Works on my Chromecast | I started watching Halo. I use Xiaomi Mi Box S to stream media on my TV. The issue is that the SkyShowtime app is crashing again and again when you push the play button. Even if I cast from my smartphone app to smart TV, I get this error ""Ooups, we have encounted a problem"", We also use Netflix,AmazonPrime,Disney+,HBO Max, which are working perfectly fine on the same Xiaomi Mi Bos S. Of course, we will cancel the monthly subscription as SkyShowtine servers and application are not well defined. | Not the best selection of movies and series. Ugly subtitles that hide the picture. I only got the subscription for the Star Trek series. | Just really bad 'streaming', more like dripping. Mobile app is slow, controls are bad, and cannot maintain a smooth HD video going for more than 5 seconds. Initially thought these were startup issues, but after months there is no improvement and clear signs of deterioration. The web-based version is not much better, with most movies not loading, or if they do run, restarting at random intervals. Only good performance when you first download the video file, undermining the whole 'streaming' thing | Your subtitle format is horrible and offers no way of changing it. The trailer feature is also horrbile and offers no way of changing it. I'd expect these things in 2013, not 2023. | SkyShowTime has not been working under Google TV for days. | App does not work in Redmi note 12 | When you start to cast an episode that is partly watched, it always starts from the beginning, and forgets where you were. Subtitles sometimes just disappear as well. Can this please be fixed? | not sure why the app would need to have permission to access my location. | A billion dollar company doesn't have an app on PS5, so I have to watch the app on my pc or phone. Also several Paramount+ shows are missing, such as South Park. Good selection of new movies. No anime or adult cartoons. | Ide írom, mert máshol semmilyen információt nem közölnek. Néhány napja GoogleTV-n az egyik pillanatról a másikra, összeomlott az applikáció. Azóta már el sem indul. | Chromecast user, new born problems and only stereo sound on Dolby 5.1. Not enough for home cinema set. Update required. Please stop auto play next episode on Chromecast, reason to quit. | works ok | Can't play most movies and shows on Google TV HD. Very bad. | worst app ever. | It does not work. Suddenly it stopped to work on my phone and on my TV box (as the error message says, it is not working in my country, which is not correct, I am in Hungary). Please fix it or I will a cancel it immediately. | Como usuario de varias plataformas de streaming la pondría un 4 sobre 10.Una aplicación de streaming sin apenas errores y mejor que otras como HBO. EL PROBLEMA viene con el contenido tiene un repertorio de series y películas escaso te venden Skysowtime como la fusión perfecta de 6 productoras TOP pero la realidad es que cada una de ellas aporta 20 películas ""contadas"" a la plataforma tiene menos contenido que Prime Video que ya es decir . | Would like to have Greek subtitles also. | No autoplay when Chromecasting. | The app does not even open. | Cool and smart selection of movies. My favourite, by far. Thank you for all the good time 🙂 | downloaded episodes expire way too fast and there is no warning about it | 2023, no 4k streaming? | Android TV user here! I use phillips android TV and other streaming platforms work perfect on it, never a single lagg or quality drop I swear to God! Now I have huge issues with SkyShowtime: 1. Whatever I am watching it is lagging constantly stoping for split second. 2. Whenever I start watching something, it starts with very low quality and builds up to high quality. 3. Subtitles wont turn off and they look just hideous YALL NEED TO IMOROVE IT IM PAYING FOR IT AND ITS WORLD CRYSIS!!! TY | What happened to ""continue watching"" ? I'm streaming something, close that app and then I have to search for that movie all over again. Subtitles are working only when they want. Streaming over 4g is a struggle. Tv app is very laggy and takes forever to load. Great service poor app. Keep on improving it! | The currently watching episodes no longer appear on a section in home page. I must enter ""My Stuff"" and open the show and resume the episode. | No ""Continue watching"" anymore. Bring it back! | Lots of good shows. Unfortunately the streaming is constantly pausing for a second. None of my other streaming services do this, and it's VERY irritating | The content is ok and is getting better but the app is just plain bad. 3 major headaches for me - autorewind is just terrible; can't login with qr code - you have to enter the password manually which is pretty hard on most remotes; the subtitles don't have an outline making them hard to read on light backgrounds. | 0*: It was nice at start, now does not work on my Xiaomi MI Led TV 4S 55 4k. It says not available in my region. It cannot be the rootcause of the problem because it has been working for the past few months. Please do something because that's not what I subscribed to. Do you need my money??? Fix the problem | Doesn't work on Lenovo tablet. | Crashes contantly | Far better than HBO, 60% cheaper on top of that!!! | ""Continue watching"" section disappeared on all platforms more than a week ago, and still not fixed. Hard to believe this was done on purpose—if so, a truly stupid decision—as it makes it so annoying to watch series or to resume a movie without this feature. Also hard to believe that such removal remained unnoticed during the release process. So please fix this quickly if you don't want to infuriate some of your user base any longer. | It does play video, but that is the only good thing. It did not allow to change playback speed, it can't be minimized, it can't play video in a pop-up window. Searching is poor. Can't change video quality preferences. Overall very poor user experience. Latest update made it even worse. ""Continue watching"" section is gone. | Unnistaled today after receiving an email today that my subscription was canceled because the app didnt manage to verify my biling payment,i mention that i had the 2 euros monthly for lifetime payment for over one year now.canceled by skyshowtime and now i have to pay the 4 euros plan.no thanks.verry disapointed | Subtitles need GPS. I would be embarrassed if I made this. The App is decent, but no Netflix. Having the Showtime content available is great. One of my favourite production houses. They fixed the horrendous issues with the subtitles, finally, but now the ""continue watching"" disappeared. I scroll and I scroll, it is nowhere to be found. @Showtime: when you fix this, don't be Netflix and make the location dynamic - it should always be the first row! | Freaking app! I pay, so I want to download in the best video quality! I CANNOT FIND THE PROPER SETTINGS! WHERE CAN I CHANGE THE DOWNLOAD QUALITY OPTIONS??? | Better than NeTFLiX | Love this app but put back ""continue watching"" for the fifth star! 😀 | many streaming glitches | bad streaming quality | Canceled subscription a day before renewal, and was charged for it the same day Why do you charge a day ahead of the renewal date, and the subscription was cancelled! Awful! | not able to see the number of episodes of e.g. Rabbit Hole Subtitle selection is also strange | It is stated that there is Dolby 5.1 content. Maybe this is the case but streaming via Chromecast gen2 there is no Dolby 5.1 on any content. I get Dolby 5.1 on HBO Max without any problem. I have reported this to support team in December 2022 but so far no success. Reply to SkyShowtime response: My setup supports Dolby 5.1, on every other platform I can enjoy Dolby 5.1, just not on SkyShowtime. I think that the problem is that you haven't tested properly on Chromecast Ultra 4k (this is gen2) | Don't get this if you're in the NL looking for Paramount+ content like StarTrek Lower Decks. They don't have it. (Seasons 1 & 2 are on Prime; the rest, who knows?) | Nie działa Chromecast. Apka zawiesza się. Nie da się nic oglądać! | The app is not working since yesterday, keep opens and black screen is shown. | excellent 👍 | Frasier! | There are a lot of shows not having all seasons. Why bother include them, when you know you will never add rest of seasons? I gave the service a try because of some movies and now I noticed most of them are gone without any official heads-up. Most probably I will soon terminate the subscription... | Great app | Needs an option to disable autoplay, it starts some random movie which stays in your continue watching forever. And I really don't like it doesn't play movie credits to the end. Also should have an option to not autoplay trailers. | Thank you very much for you quality library of timeless masterpieces, both movies and TV shows. | One of the best! | Best movies 🎬 | very bad user interface. too many hoops to jump through to get to a list with all movies or shows | One of the best streaming services, excellent app, highly recommended 👌","{""1"":4835,""2"":2998,""3"":5067,""4"":9926,""5"":40426}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 179.00 - CZK 1,429.00 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","SkyShowtime","7044461797746424693","help@skyshowtime.com","https://www.skyshowtime.com","NDSM-plein 6

Well done Gogle | no quick searches. no good and fast sorting options. no sorting or rearrangement. no index or directory. pathetic lowlevel app goodness gracious. Laggy buggy garbage if you use more than 5 auths accs | The time base given to verify your account is very short due to which account verification takes several days.

There is no way to turn it off in the app. | V aplikaci se nedá zobrazit PIN ke kartě - nevím, odkud máte ty screenshoty, no aplikace pro Android tak nevypadá, vygenerování jednorázového čísla karty pro nákupy na podivných stránkách, které by mohly zneužít číslo karty Moneta nepozná, nově také zmizely ikony v přehledu transakcí, takže když chci výdavky řadiť dle kategorií, tak vůbec nevidím, která již je zařazena a která ne. A o možnosti uložit si nějaké časté příjemce nemluvě.... | Proč zase komplikovat věci? Aby UI/design experti měli co žrát? | Cant use app when AnyDesk is installed | Mám trochu ""problem"" s jazykem v aplikaci. Co jsem pochopil, tak aplikace přebírá v základním nastavení jazyk telefonu (já mám telefon v anglictine). Aplikaci bych chtěl mít v češtině, což tedy lze v nastavení nastavit. Každopádně po nastavení češtiny v aplikaci je poté aplikace napůl česky a napůl anglicky. Např spodní ""menu"" mám celé anglicky, a jiné věci zase v češtině. | Většinou jsem schovívavý a nehodnotím negativně, nicméně v případě Monety ji shledávám jako neprofesionální banku. Například neustále mi chodí otravné emaily že to či ono je teď skvělé/nové ""Bezkontaktní placení je pohodlné"". Marketingové emaily jsem si vypnul, vyjádření reklamací je že to není marketing a nelze tyto emaily vypnout. Nic podobného jsem nezažil u jiných bank (mBank, ČSOB). | V ČR best. Oproti světovým lídrům z Fintech sektoru stále zaostává. Prosím zkopírujte funkce z Revolutu a poté dále stavějte na tom co se Vám zamlouvá. Uvítal bych zaokrouhlování plateb a zbytek spořit do trezoru, tak jak to má Revolut dále je výborné sdílení plateb, jako má Revolut atd.. Design máte také moc český... Celkem pozadu oproti světovému standartu. Chtělo by to posunout dopředu.. | Tomu nemůžu uvěřit. Mobilní aplikace nejde spustit z důvodu nainstalovaného AnyDesku (který nutně potřebuji) v mobilu. To si myslíte, že nevím co dělám? Za pochopení mi neděkujte, nechápu. | Prepnuti z AJ do CZ ma nulovy efekt. Nelze zobrazit cislo karty. | Chybí mi u spořící účtu co se obálek týče možnost nastavit trvalý příkaz např z hlavního či spořící účtu do dané obálky trvalý příkaz a ne do volných prostředků. U AirBank je možnost zvolit u spoření do obálek v trvalém příkazu. Mohu vybrat zda chci klasicky na spořící účet do volných prostředků nebo do dané obálky. Tohle by chtělo doplnit !! | Velmi zle. A nepaci sa mi, ze si Moneta vynucuje pouzivanie appky poplatkom za prihlasenie sa do internetbankingu na webe. | It's a great convenience but the payments seem to take a bit more time than expected. | Aplikace trvá na odinstalování jiné legitimní aplikace. Už jen to prohlíží ostatní nainstalované aplikace je nepřijatelné lezení do soukromí. | Smooth navigation, user friendly. So far looks my 2nd best banking app, since I don't yet use Moneta as my first banking account. | Apka bývala skvělá, ale po updatu 2-3 roky zpět se výrazně zhoršila, poslední dobou je už skoro nepoužitelná. Neustále errory, zamrzání, každé přihlášení, je bolestivý zážitek. | very good | Velka spokojenost | Čím dál horší prace s kategoriemi. Vše se cpe do jídla, třeba i Sportisimo. Po změně kategorie se v přehledu nezmění. Nastavování kategorií v prehistorickém internetovém bankovnictví. Neumí to v apce ani novém internetbankingu. Nemožnost si jednou nastavenou kategorii nastavit pro příští automat. Stále dokola ručně. Na upozornění daného stavu ani neodepíší. Hrůza | Hezký, přehledný a zatím vše funguje jak má. Edit: Nelíbí se mi, že nemůžu používat anydesk ani teamviewer. Používám tyto nástroje celkem často. | Crashing all the time, loading takes way too long. After the latest update, the app automatically adds two zeros (BEFORE the decimal point) to the amount sent, rendering it completely unusable. Considering switching banks just because of how bad this app is. | Unstable. I can't get how this app can be rated as one of the best?! I'm getting connection timeouts many times in day. Support is awful, don't care about complaints. | I am not able to log into the app. Restarting the mobile device does not help as well. The first registration email is also years ago and cant find it. | Po poslední aktualizaci se mi nezobrazují všechny výdaje a příjmy. Nejdou posílat peníze ze spořícího účtu přímo z dané obálky. Dříve to šlo. Pokud budou problémy opraveny, změním hodnocení. Edit: opraveno, dávám 5 hvězd | Protože se do aplikace nedostanete pokud používáte AnyDesk nebo jiné potřebné apky pro práci, tak Monetu nedoporučuju a ruším účty. Jdu ke konkurenci která upozorní že mám AnyDesk nainstalovaný ale pustí mě do mobilního bankovnictvína moji zodpovědnost!!! | Works OK enough, but quite buggy. Timeouts, app restarting itself etc. Language setting translates only about 50 % of text, the rest is still in device language. | Vyžaduje k aktivaci zadat QR kód, ale nenabízí možnost ho zadat. Hlava XXII. | Smart banka je důvod, proč zruším účet u Monety. Nikdo mi nebude přikazovat, jak mám pracovat se svým bankovním účtem. Přecházím do české Trinity banky | Reklamy při potvrzování platby, to jako fakt? | Pixel 6, Android 14 aplikace se nenačítá | Poslední aktualizace přinesla jen zklamání. Ošklivé, nepřehledné, pomalé... Základní informace o vlastním účtu se zobrazí až po pěkných pár vteřinách načítání a to jen po rozkliknutí, namísto zobrazení hned na úvodní straně, jak tomu bylo dříve... Seriózně přemýšlím o změně banky. Jak je vůbec možné, že se odsouhlasí změna, která z nejlepší bankovní aplikace (uživatelsky) vytvoří naprostý, s prominutím, odpad. Mrzí mě to. Myslel jsem, že má Moneta na víc. Edit po roce: vůbec nic se nezlepšilo. | You are not able to use app, while Anydesk and similar app is installed on mobile. Not able just confirm awarness of risk, you are not able to continue into app. Feedback on callcenter was to uninstalled, but I need those remote apps for work, so banking is useless. Other banks allow you to accept the warning and continue. Moneta considers its customers as legally incapable persons with no choise. | Extremely slow starting and a lot's of adds on services I'm not interested in. Plus i just found out several of my payment templates get deleted and it fails when i try to create new ones. | To ted musim odinstalovat Anydesk abych se dostal do aplikace?! Promiň te, ale limitovat klienty kteří potrebují Anydesk nebo Teamviewer k praci, že se nedostanou na banku? Nebylo by lepsi klienty v tomto vychovavat nez omezovat ty co si umi davat pozor? Jinak pro mne aplikace nema proste vyznam, kdyz ji nemohu pouzit a pracovni aplikace jsou prednejsi. Myslel jsem si, že zrovna Moneta je pokrokova banka... | Bugy, spatna odezva, nelogicke ovladani. Edit: Po roce pouzivani prechazim k jine bance,tahle aplikace se opravdu neda... | Nelze spustit, pokud je na telefonu nainstalovaný Anydesk. Asi nejsem jediný, kdo jej k práci potřebuje. | Opět si ze mne děláte srandu, vaše aplikace zřejmě trpí paranoiou a nutí mě odinstalovat aplikace které potřebuji k práci Jedná se o Teamviewer a Anydesk. Vidím tlačíto i přesto spustit banku, ale nejde to stisknout. S vašima vývojáři nesouhlasím, aplikace jsou bezpečné. Problém je jen v uživatelích. Tohle se dá řešit úplně jinak, např. nepovolit přihlášení když je aplikace spuštěná, při spuštění té dané aplikace se odhlásit z banky. Nebo jen donutit uživatele změnit nastavení pro aplikaci. | Potřebuji mít nainstalovaný Anydesk i TeamViewer. Kvůli své práci. Aplikace nejde spustit dokud tyto aplikace neodinstaluju což nemůžu. Odpověď: děkujeme za recenzi je stupidní odpověd. Správná odpověď zní: omlouváme se, opravíme to. | Shows ads for irrelevant products. Repeatedly. When you try to rate the app lower than what they want they ask you to email and they hide the prompt instead. :) :) | Not only my smart bank app data are still corrupted, but it's blocking me from logging in, as i am using anydesk as personal app for connecting to pc from mobile. | V zahraničí téměř nepoužitelná!!! V EU funguje zpomaleně, v USA, Africe či Novém Zélandě téměř vůbec!!! Mohli byste s těmi servery něco udělat. Pokud nelze poslat ze zahraničí příkaz k úhradě, tak apl. k ničemu!!! | Suddenly decided that it won't let me into the application if I have AnyDesk installed. Meaning I am locked out of my bank because of an application I need for work. | iOS app is much better. Widgets do not work at all and overall it feels quite clunky compared to iOS app. | simple and reliable | I have set up the way I want my accounts lined up, and they're still constantly switching places. What in the world is that? Why even have the option to line them up when they don't stay in one place? This app just keeps getting worse, and I thought that wasn't possible after that legendary switch from great to horrible. | Aplikace mi začala padat. Nedokážu potvrzovat platby. Povede se cca 1 pokus z 30. Komunikace s podporou na jedničku. Domluveno, že mě bude kontaktovat někdo přímo z vývoje. Už je to X dní a nikdo se neozval. | After latest update app stop working and constantly crashing. I can't send payment, many times even confirm payment, or look at account history. Please work on that! I can't use Internet Banka if cannot confirm payments. | Aplikace již několik týdnů nefunguje, v 99% se nejde přihlásit, obrazovka zůstane na té první stránce s logem a vůbec se nezobrazí možnost přihlášení. Poslední verzi mám. Asi to brzo bude důvod změnit banku, když se nelze spolehnout :( a to bývala MMB moje nejoblíbenější | Plno reklam a záložek na nabídky produktů, které nejdou skrýt. | Netýká se to mobilní aplikace, ale je to jedno z mála míst, která někdo čte a reaguje na ně. Sundavám všechny hvězdičky za to, že posíláte reklamní SMS, která nelze zrušit. (A kdovíjak dlouhý rozhovor po telefonu nepovažuji za relevantní způsob, jak zrušit zasílání obchodních sdělení.) | It works really well, interface is intuitive. I like a lot that you can bring in live information about accounts in other Banks via a token, and have one central hub for monitoring and accessing your overall banking. This feature does not affect applications that you might have for other institutions. | Poslední měsíc se mi nedaří přihlásit do aplikace. Někdy to funguje, většinou ne. Vznikají trapné situace, kdy potřebuji někomu zaplatit a nemám přístup k účtu. Aplikace podporuje přepínání profilů (osobní vs firemní), ale nefunguje nastavení defaultního profilu. Kvůli tomu selhává potvrzení plateb a je potřeba znovu opakovat dokud neprojde. Psal jsem na support, kde mě odpálkovali s tím, že si mám updatovat aplikaci (samozřejmě mám poslední verzi). Kdysi to bývala nejlepší aplikace na trhu. | Dobrá a funkční aplikace, ale už MOC komplikovaná. Připadám si jako důchodce, když nemůžu najít úplně základní věci. Mělo by se zase trochu ubrat a přepracovat UI, aby bylo více intuitivní. Tohle už je trochu moc :D | All perfect! | OK. Add says: ""you will have product in a few minutes!"" No way! App gives ""unexpected error"" no matter what way you use to confirm identity (Bank ID, or scan documents). So after 45min of useless attempts you call support and it sounds like they are having a party in the background. Cool. So 1 hr passed and I am going to another bank, thanks. | OK | Pro nováčky neintuitivní, mám 2 další účty i aplikace a přesto jsem zde měla problém vytvořit nový trvalý příkaz, chtělo to trochu zkoumání. Nezvládá landscape mode, na tabletu komplikace. | works well | Bohužel nefunguje. Včera jsem chtěl poprvé využít funkci Smart banky při platbě kartou na internetu. 2x otisk prstu, nic, 2x PIN, nic. Nakonec jsem si musel nechat poslat beztak SMS. K čemu potom za aplikace je? | Tristni uroven zabezpeceni a nucene zhorseni. Doposud byla moznost 2FA overeni(sms+dlouhe heslo), nyni uz je jedinou ochranou 4 mistny PIN. | Dva mĕsíce nefunguje směnárna - ani na mobilu, ani na PC: ""Neočekávaná chyba - zkuste to později."" Řešení v nedohlednu. Po překonání 1st level supportu žadná další odezva. Dělám jim testera. Vývoj na to z vysoka... Asi třeba nejprve naplánovat do sprintu. --- Odpověď Monety jen podtrhuje onu tragikomičnost. Se ""zákaznickým servisem"" si dopisuji již měsíc. A výsledek? Mám napsat na zákaznický servis. | Good bank | Nelíbí se mi že se aplikace jmenuje Smart Banka, místo například Moneta Banking, nebo tak něco. Také mi chybí možnost přepnout jazyk (telefon mám anglicky, ale právnicinu bych raději česky). Naopak kladně hodnotím funkčnost (momentálně více funkcí než internet banking např v nastavování limitu nebo přechod od jiné banky). Vítám také možnost přidat a odebrat další telefon/zařízení. | Uses 3rd party to monitor everything on the phone. 3rd party !!! EDIT: I write in English they reply in Czech. Changing my review to from 2 to 1 star. The above stands still: it is a spyware ! Collects everything possible from the phone!EDIT2: So now they switched to English. Interesting why they didn't reply in English initially. Anyways, I have the mobile apps of 3 other banks. They don't collect that much data. And mainly: they don't provide it to a 3rd party companies!!!!! | Funkcionalita je dobrá i když mi aplikace nepřipadá úplně přehledná, ale to je spíš o zvyku. Nízké hodnocení dávám, protože mě hodně naštvalo, že aplikace odmítá fungovat (nejde se přihlásit do aplikace, ani přes aplikaci potvrdit přihlášení na PC), při nízkém stavu baterie (na mém telefonu se na 17 a míň % nezapne, s tím, že telefon samotný zvládne ještě půl dne fungovat). | TLDR: Nová verze aplikace je nedodělaná; Shrnutí: vizuální glitche, aplikace se občas sama vypne (spadne), navigace aplikací není intuitivní (3 různá tlačítka pro nastavení aplikace, atd), vizuálně mi přijde nová verze méně přehledná (je z toho teď omalovánka); Zatím jsem nenašel věc, v čem by byla nová verze lepší, než ta stará, za to je tam řada věcí, které jsou oproti předchozí aplikaci značně horší. | Po update mi pise ze Smart Bance chybi internet a nejde se vubec prihlasit. | Aplikace fungovala v poradku do okamziku, kdy se mi vzdy pri otevreni objevi 'something went wrong, please try again later'. Support team byla jen ztrata casu a nakonec nebyli schopni muj problem vyresit. Nechapu, proc v tento okamzik nuti sve uzivatele na potvrzeni skrze smartbanku a ne sms, kdyz je smartbanka nepouzitelna. Jsem u teto banky jiz 14 let, ale nyni prejdu k jine bance, ktere normalne funguje aplikace. | Ze všech bank nejlepší podmínky pro BÚ. Mobilní aplikace ale bohužel přesný opak. | Nelze zkopírovat číslo účtu v detailu platby. 🤦‍♂️ | Great app, lot of useful features | Poslední aktualizace se nějak nepovedla a před pokusem o přihlášení zobrazuje informaci, že schází připojení k internetu. Ověřeno, a minimálně telefon je k internetu připojen. | Simple to use app, makes ones life easier! | Spyware. Collects data about phone and installed apps. | Notifikace k autorizaci platby kartou se objevují jen občas, většinou musím otevřít aplikaci manuálně a přihlásit se, abych platbu potvrdil. Notifikace o zaplacení kartou ale fungují vždy. | Update - 3 různí lidé na MOJI urgenci slibují, že se do týdne ozvou, po měsíci se samozřejmě nikdo neozve. Nemůžu platit kartou přes internet, nemůžu platit QR platby. Spousta ztraceného času. Dají se dát záporné hvězdičky? Poslední review ze 7.11.: Už více jak týden SB NEFUNGUJE - nelze se přihlásit, appka crashuje. Přeinstaloval jsem, znovu nastavoval zařízení pro SB a opět opakovaně crash. Už před měsícem jsem musel appku reinstalovat, aby fungovala, teď už raději nefunguje vůbec... | gold-black design was faaaar beter + too often technical service in progress ... | Awful, keeps crashing. If something ain't broke, don't fix it | Posila notifikace s nevyzadanou reklamou. Vyjadreni zakaznicke podpory: ""Aplikace je marketingovou plochou spolecnosti, reklamy nejdou nijak zrusit."" | Aplikace nefunguje v zahranici, kdyz si dam VPN do CR,tak normalne bezi. Proc? | Reklama na dětské konto (které je pro mě nerelevantní) je na prominentním místě v aplikaci, zabírá prostor mnohem důležitějším informacím (kvůli kterým aplikaci mám) a nejde vypnout!!!!!!! | The app is laggy sometimes | Jedním slovem katastrofa. Když se po dlouhém čekání na android konečně objevila možnost rušení spořících účtů, tak jakákoliv snaha o využití této funkce končí chybou : Nepodařilo se načíst data. A to už od té doby proběhly 2 hotfixy. | *už opraveno díky* Po updatu neumožňuje převést peníze mezi vlastními účty dlouhým stisknutím a pretazenim na jiný Můžete funkcionalitu prosím vrátit Děkuji | Super application 👌 | Prvotní neduhy nového interface zmizely. Opět je to plně použitelná bankovní aplikace. Nicméně záložka Insurance stále nefunguje a bylo by fajn lépe zapracovat stavební spoření do aplikace, pohyby na účtu, jednoduchý převod peněz. | After recent update just mentions ""something went wrong"" and that's it. I would like to politely remind to developers, that people use this program to manage their finances and it is probably the biggest part of bank client experience with the bank. The fact it just stops working without any hint how to fix it is plain negligence. Before when it ""worked"" it wasn't the best either, especially qr code scanning was of poor quality. What mBank app would scan fine, this one failed. | Jsou to zmetci. Plošně zablokovali transakce na burzu. Myslí si, že můžou rozhodovat za co budu utrácet svoje peníze. Končím, čus | Po aktualizaci nefunguje, stale pise ""smart bance chybi internet"" :-/ po reinstalaci to uz funguje. Celkove nevidim v nove aplikaci zadnou cestu v pred, z hlediska UX je to takova beta verze. | Dříve to byla jedna z uživatelsky nejpříjemnějších aplikací, co se bankovnictví týče. A právě díky tomu byla MONETA mým hlavním účtem. S posledními aktualizacemi se však naprosto vše zkomplikovalo (z transferu jedním posunutím se stala akce minimálně pětkrát delší a asi desetkrát komplikovanější), o přehlednosti ani nemluvě... Třešničkou na dortu je, když v akcích na svém účtu místo jména majitele účtu vidíte pouze zprávu příjemce... Mým primárním účtem se tak stal zase ten od konkurence. | Přestal fungovat widget, ale podle vyjádření Monety, to se řeší.... Už skoro měsíc... | 2022-10-14: • Nefunguje korektně s myší: kolečkem ani tažením nelze posunout obsah (v Home, Cards, Settings) → v režimu DeX na monitoru jsou některé funkce mimo dosah. Přitom v More kolečkem myši i tažením posouvat LZE. • Část apky je anglicky, část česky. Nesmyslně opravuje částku při platbě: 1000,10 → 1,000,1 → 1. • Při zadávání částky platby skryje disponibilní zůstatek. • 2022-09: Nikde nevidím tlačítko Aktivovat (kartu), o kterém se psalo v dopise s novou kartou (mělo být v detailu karty). | Vůbec nefunguje. Jen hlásí chyby. Podpora nedělá nic. Otřesný zážitek. BTW, jsem vývojář a nechápu, jak si to mohou dovolit | Good 👍 | This is is the worse update from Moneta, I have tried a million time just to upload my id still not succuss. I am very disappointed in this new app for that matter I have downgrade from 5 stars to 1 if there was zero, I would have rated the app 0. In this case I will rather login from website instead using this application. | Aplikaci po aktualizaci nelze používat bez schválení sběru dat o aplikacích na mém telefonu a sledováním z jakých internetových přípojek telefon používám. Hláška se odkazuje na ""prověřený software třetí strany"" který tyto data data zabírá a ukládá, není ale jasné o jaký software se jedná a kde jsou tyto data ukládány. Každopádně jsem aplikaci odistaloval a měním banku. | Právě jsem při spuštění aplikace dostal výzvu v angličtině, abych aplikaci povolil permanentní špehování. To snad nemyslíte vážně! Pokud bych si měl představit kybernetický útok na mobilní aplikaci, vypadal by právě takhle. Jak mám z té výzvy poznat, že pochází z banky a není podstrčená? | Na to, ze Moneta rika, ze za par mesicu nebude mozno se prihlasit pres webove rozhrani, je aplikace nefunkcni. Pri rucnim zadavani qr kodu, copy, paste, napsalo something went wrong. Uzasny error. Pri opetovnem unknown error. Skutecne odladena aplikace. A proc aplikace mluvi jen anglicky, kdyz je pro pouziti v CR? | Už několik týdnů nefungují Widgety na ploše. Člověk pro kontrolu zůstatku musí otvírat celou Smart banku. | To slabší na trhu bankovních aplikací. V přehledu účtů formát čísla 9,999.99 Kč v detailu účtu 9 999,99 Kč. Aplikace několikrát do měsíce padne (subjektivní, ale jiné aplikace nepadají). 1. místo ""Zlatá koruna"" je jen marketing - realita 3,7 z 5 hvězd v Google Play. Ale kdo nemá srovnání s konkurencí, může být spokojený. | Great bank app | Super. Bohužel mi na Samsung Galaxy S21 nefunguje widget. Stále se načítá a nikdy se nenačte, i když je povolen v nastavení . | Really good app | Vše přehledné, rychlé, stabilní a funguje jak má. | This app did not even start to work, said that something went wrong. I was considering to set up an account but like this I won't. | Jde se nějak vrátit k předchozí versi? Update je, promiňte, ale to nejde jinak říct, debilní, strakatý jak pro děti, velká tlačítka jak pro seniory a v QR platbě nefunguje čtení kódu ze souboru. | OK-ish, but has major flaws. For example, ""Savings"" (sporici) and ""Fixed term"" (terminovy vklad) accounts share the same template, thus showing exactly the same info. Which is wrong. They deserve to be tailored. Fixed Term needs to explicitly display Start of term; End of Term; Interest Rate (the row for this is empty); ideally the expected sum to be paid at the end of the term, this should be easy to calculate; button to withdraw early and the corresponding penalties. | Whatever I try to do, I get 'unexpected error'. How am I supposed to work with my money after 01/12 when Moneta will use this app ONLY? Fix it, it's worthless when you can't do anything because of 'unexpected error'! | Horrible new version, adding money to Revolut is a pain and lot of time app says something went wrong maybe too much maintenance I m in different time zone and this message apper at least once a week. | Tu novou appku dělala nějaká chráněná dílna? Stará aplikace mě téměř donutila přejít k vám od konkurence, nová mi připomněla, že sem ten přechod nedokončil a měl bych si zbývající prostředky přesunout zpět a účet zrušit. | Couldn't activate the card. I can not see the PIN. A few improvements necessary. RESPONSE: I am not able to see those options in Internet Banking or mobile app. | Po update změna UI, velmi nepřehledné, za mne velmi špatný krok | Great banking app | Nejhorsi update, ktery se teto aplilaci dostal. Tvrdite, ze funkce prevodu penez pretahnutim z jednoho na druhy ucet jak tomu bylo u drivejsi verze by mela byt opet aktovni. Ale nefunguje. | Celkem ok a dobre funkce, jen po nascanovani QR kodu se stane chyba a od te doby se vsechny castky u zadanych plateb nasobi 100x... docela neprijemny problem (asi chyba v desetinnem oddelovaci v ceskem rozhrani a anglickem mobilu. Nez potkam QR kod, tak to funguje, po nem se to rozbije a je nutny restart aplikace) | Převod jedním tahem po novém updatu nefunguje, aplikace je teď celkově méně přehledná, není tak intuitivní jako předtím a ještě ke všemu hůře vypadá.. předchozí verze byla mnohem lepší. | Often stops working on Android. | New version is terrible | This app lacks many financiall planning features. E.g. working with tags for transactions and further analysis is cumbersome. I would appreciate more simple utils similar to maybe.co financial planner. There are also some bugs from time to time, but I understand this app is insanely complex and hard to test for your QA team. | The new version is terrible... You can't activate new card in the new version, you need to go to web... And did anyone try to set card limits in the new version, where the popup keyboard covers the fields? Whoever butchered the once good app to this mess should be fired | Cannot scan ID in app. Missing personal information. Buggy version of app. | And the ""most difficult and least customer friendly app of the year"" is... Seriously, is this a banking app or just the way to piss customers off...? Nothing works, you have to try 5 times, only to get the message that ""we have you data but want you to take pictures of your ID again"". Would be fun if they were not handling your money... | Ta nová aktualizace je katastrofa, stará verze byla o 100% přehlednější. | Však to crashuje když jdu do detailu účtu. Týden zpět jsem se nemohl ani přihlásit. Co jste stim udělali? Proč mě trapite? | Dá se vrátit zpět aktualizace? Poslední verze aplikace je slušně řečeno nepoužitelná... | Dal bych 5 hvezd pred tim nez jste zmenily vzhled a funkcnost vasi aplikace. Byla uasna, dejte aspon moznost tu starou verzi pouzivat, protoze tohle je neprehlednej bordel. Nebo to proste vratte zpet. | Docela dobré, obvykle tuhle aplikaci mam rad. V poslední dobe ale obcas pro pokusech o platbu pres QR kod scan spadne a nic nejde udelat. Dela to na stejnem QR kodu i bezna verze app na jinem telefonu a jinem uctu. Samotny QR kod přitom v RFBank app prošel. | Update May 2022: proč jste tak přehlednou a rychlou aplikaci zkazili novým designem? Nejen, že je extra nepřehledný, ale aplikace je o dost pomalejší a na většinu úkonů je třeba více kliknutí. Tohle je za mě krok velmi špatným směrem. K reakci MMB: místo zbytečných reakcí si prosím přečtěte pořádně jak mou recenzi, tak ostatních po květnové aktualizaci. Námětů na opravy (úpravy) v nich najdete dost. | Appka nefunguje, pada. Nedokazem ohodnotit vyzor a pod. Dokazem ale podotknut, ze zo vsetkych bankovych appiek bola ta od monety najlepsie navrhnuta. Ak sa to zmenilo ako sa ludia stazuju, tak sa netesim, ked to zacne fungovat. | Když naskenuji QR kód z vašeho webu, tak na mě furt vyskakuje Invalid QR code | Since the major update, completely wrong presentation of credit cards (no details on the front page). After today's update still not fixed | It is a good app, unfortunately in the new version, when I try to change limits on my card the keyboard wont go away, resulting in me, not being able to save changes, so in the end, I cannot change it, which is a huge mistake and should be immediately fixed | Proč nejde měnit limit na kartě v noci? To to schválně pozastavujete? | Nová verze výrazně neprehlednejsi. Opravdu už nemůžu zadat převod tahem prstu z jednoho vlastního účtu na druhý? A proč nevidím v přehledu účtů číslo účtu? Nutite mě každou chvíli nesmyslně zakládat nový spořící účet a tyto věci mi pomáhaly se v tom vyznat. Zrušení starých účtu asi přes aplikaci taky nejde :( | I used to be very happy with this app. But after last update I am not able to orient in it. As somebody mentioned before, IT looks like a high school project, rather than professional app. IT Evžen does not support dark mode anymore, do everytime I use this app, my eyes just hurts when I have to switch to light mode to be able to read text. | Bývala to skvělá aplikace, po poslední aktualizaci se ale stala velmi uživatelsky nepřívětivou a také nevzhlednou. | Kterej galaxy brain zavelel k tomu grafickýmu overhaulu, kterej je naprosto ohyzdnej? Proč nyní v seznamu historických příkazů nevidím jména druhých účtů? Musim kliknout na každou platbu zvlášť, abych zjistil, kdo to poslal. Proč vylepšujete aplikaci tím, že ji zhoršujete? | Hrůza po poslední aktualizaci, nepřehledné. Jen víc složitější převod emzi svým účty.. | Po poslední aktualizaci spuštění smart banky to vypadá, jako by se jiná aplikace vloudila do přihlašovací obrazovky a pokoušela ukrást PIN. Asi je to záměr, ale pro jistotu jsem se radši přihlásil na jiném telefonu, kde aktualizace ještě není. | Z naprosto jednoduche a uzivatelsky prijemne aplikace jste udelali neprehlednej paskvil. Je mozne se vratit k puvodni verzi? | Although i like the looks actually the usability got slightly worse with latest update in may 2022. I used to transfer between my accounts by dragging from one acc to another. Now have to click on one, copy acc number, go back, click on next and paste the number ... 5 steps instead of 1. Not sure why they removed the ability | Aplikace vypadá velice krásně a moderně, ale prosím Vás, spravte ty bugy. Tam, kde by měl záznam měsíčních výdajů končit, se celý seznam začne opakovat a je nekonečný. Souhrn měsíčních výdajů taky nevychází a ani se nezobrazují všechny transakce. | Nový vzhled aplikace je neodpustitelný zločin. Z nejlepší bankovní aplikace jste udělali nepřehledný a odpudivý... cosi... Veliké zklamání. | What the hell have you done to your app????!!!?????!!!! This was one of the most professional looking, perfectly functional apps I have ever used. After the latest update it looks like something put together by a student for a school project. This is horrible. Several options are hidden or difficult to find, the design is cancerous, it is unsightly. Please make it look the way it was. This is sad... | Předešlá verze za mě byla na 6 hvězd. Výborná, přehledná, všechno rychle po ruce. Nový vizuál je děsný. Dávám jednu hvězdu. Nepřehledný, obří font, nejde tahem převádět peníze mezi svými účty atd. | good. edit: annoying offers and for me useless messages from bank. can't stop it in the app. why? edit for delevopers - jsou to reklamní nabídky monety na půjčku atd.. zobrazuje se to na hlavni strance po přihlášení. nenašel jsem/nelze to vypnout/zakázat. btw, po dalším update celkem grafickej odpad. sry, ale před tím lepší vizuál. | Jděte do háje s tou změnou designu, nebo aspoň ponechte přepínač na tu starou. Aplikace je teď naprosto nepřehledná a hnusná, tenhle Apple-like design mi pije krev. REAKCE: Nepřehledná je správa běžného účtu. Aplikace je najednou plná nevypnutelných reklam a nabídek, původní ovládací prvky jsou z většiny skryté. Předchozí aplikace byla ceněna pro svou přehlednost, teď všechnu ztratila. Přeorat takto ze dne na den bankovní aplikaci bez jakéhokoli upozornění je velice neseriózní krok. | New version is faster and nicer | Hrozný, změna k horšímu. Oproti předchozímu, elegantnímu stylu aplikace, tahle nová verze vypadá jako mobilní téma pro seniory. Obrovská písmena, ošklivé bubliny a ještě ke všemu reklamy na produkty, které ani nejde nijak schovat. Příšerný. Není někde možnost vrátit aplikaci do původního zobrazení? | Dobry facelift | Novej design je opravdu velky spatky, ale budiz, clovek si zvykne. Presouvani prostredku tahem je ale uplne zbytecny omezeni funkcionality, kterou jsem pouzival velmi casto.","{""1"":1157,""2"":243,""3"":1086,""4"":16242,""5"":87999}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","MONETA Money Bank","MONETA+Money+Bank","smartbanka@moneta.cz","http://www.moneta.cz/smartbanka","Vyskočilova 1442/1b

So for the people who are interested in this app PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD! >:( | chescka Austria | This app is amazing I used it for a while and it made it easy for me when sketching a portrait but the reason I gave it 4 is the too many ads but although it's a great app!!❤️ | Like | best app for Sketching | I cannot believe how many ads this app has, I can't even draw without seeing ads.

First the payment process slowed down a lot. Now just the whole app si very slow. It actually becomes faster just to go to the cashdesk and pay the old way than watch the app for like 2 minutes to become a bit responsible. | Neuvěřitelně blbá aplikace. Chce to po člověku milion nastavení bezpečnosti, ale reálně se na 14 pokusů z 15 vůbec nepodaří aplikaci spustit a nahlásí neznámou chybu. Hrozné. Opravdu otravné a hrozné. | Nepodporuje tématické ikony. | Supr | Slow | ok but confusing sometimes | Tobarok | The offer for the earnt points is not very convenient.

Pokud mate vice karet = totalni bordel. Nevidite obraty na kartach, nevidite uctenky a jedine misto kde jsou videt je webova app (na co tedy mam mobilni). Na dotaz proc to tak je, je ze pri kazde platbe jeste u tankkarty musite ukazat mobilni app (na co, karta uz je pridelena). Ze app je na body nebo co a tankarta na slevy. Takze uz cekam kdy Orlen udela app na myti, app na tankovani, jidlo. Jak mam spravovat rodinný pristup a vyúčtování? | Registraci nelze dokončit, po kliknutí na odkaz v emailu se objeví ""the requested URL was rejected"" | aplikace dobrá, ale ocenil bych viditelnost cen pohonných hmot na jednotlivých stanicích | Vypadky, vypadky, vypadky... Tohle neni pouzitelne. | Aplikácia je v pohode pre používateľov Tankarta Easy. Pre použitie s Tankartou Business chýba zobrazenie aktuálnych vyhlasovaných cien.

Při zadání e-mail adresy vyhodí chybovou hlášku že reset nelze provést. Při pokusu o pře-registraci vyhodí chybu, že daná adresa je již registrovaná. | Not possible to add payment card...autorisation data not included in the transaction....not fine at all! | Jen proto, abych si na pokladně načetl koníky, musím být online a ještě se do aplikace přihlásit kódem nebo otiskem prstu? Viděli tvůrci jiné věrnostní apky, jak se to dělá? | Announced weekly price not available in the app. So it is fairly useless | Aplikace se přestala načítat.

Ať appku procházím jakkoliv, nic z toho nejsem schopen najít. Verzi mám aktuální a helpline už jsem taky volal. Díky | Velká spokojenost, aplikace je spolehlivá a vcelku svižná.

Už nemusím na benzinku a čekat s platbou než si lidi přede mnou navymysli párky v rohlíku a podobné nesmysly. Platba hned u stojanu a jízda. Protože používám v aplikaci více karet uvítal bych kdyby šly pojmenovat místo pouhého zobrazení jejich čísla. | Platba u stojanu naprosto super :) Jeste bych ocenil, kdyby seznam pobocek fungoval offline - ziji v zahranici a v CR nemam datove pripojeni. | Nelze zadat tankovací kartu Lease plan a čerpat na ni body na bezobslužných stanicích. Odměny nic moc. Chápu snahy polského Orlen korporátu sjednotit značku, ale jako CZ zákazníkovi mi to jde proti srsti, pokud beru v úvahu že Benzina byla vždy tradiční česká značka 😕 | Dobíjení v aplikaci nefunguje ani po několika pokusech. Na kartě se ale i tak vytvořila blokace, a v aplikaci stále není nic nabito | Aplikace vypadá slibně, ale pokaždé mi po zadání kódu spadne. | Aplikaci pouzivam jiz dlouho, platim s ni kazdy tyden, bohuzel posledni mesice spis nefunguje nez funguje, hlasi ruzne chyby a vetsinou nelze zaplatit. Posledni tyden uz mi nefunguje vubec, naposled vcera nahlasila pri placeni ""nelze nacist polohu"" a platba neprobehla. | Aplikace už několik dní nefunguje, problém s expirovaným certifikátem. Poslední dobou mnoho výpadků, naprosto super stav nastal, když jsem chtěl zaplatit a nefungovalo to, čímž se platba u stojanu zablokovala asi na 10 minut. Fakt super přístup a přechod k levnější konkurenci i bez aplikace se blíží... | Chyba 1004, nefunguje vůbec | V aplikaci se nezobrazují transakce ani jakou částkou mám dobitou tankovací kartu...v tom případě slouží akorát na sbírání bodů...celkem zbytečné. | Bohuzel pouze pridana karta, pokus o zaplaceni selhal. Stojan mimo provoz. Obsluha nema tuseni co s tim. Takze vysledek pro zakaznika je zdrzeni a frustrace. Hlavne, ze mate reklamu pres Google ADs, nejdriv si vyskolte vlastni lidi na cerpacich stanicich at vi co maji delat. Update 1.10.2021. Aplikace super, kvituji moznost dobijet v aplikaci primo TankEasy kartu. | Aplikace vypadá hezky, zdá se, že i funguje, ale chybí zásadní funkce, a to platba pomoci Google Pay, kterou konkurence podporuje. Do té doby pro jistou skupinu uživatelů je QR platba nepoužitelná. | Pohoda | Very good tool for payment at Benxina statios as well as for collection of rewards | Appka fungovala rok OK, před časem odmítla platbu, pak i platnou kartu, která nešla znovu přidat. Reinstalace, nová registrace, úspěšná registrace karty - výsledek platba zamítnuta. Víc už nemám chuť řešit. Třeba budete mít větší štěstí... | No offline mode (at least for displaying the QR code), slow start, camera was sometimes lagging. But otherwise useful for paying from car. | top platby z appky | Chyba 1004, po používání skoro týdně mi najednou nejde spustit aplikace | Congratulation Benzina, you created App which is not usable. I'm not possible to register. It still ends with message ""You are offline"". | Slouží dobře, ale neukazuje transakce za poslední 2 měsíce, to je znepokojující. Chybka...? Podpora píše, že se ukáží jen transakce provedené z aplikace (platba u stojanu). Po update zobrazuje zůstatek hned při startu - spokojenost. | Today, after update, app does not work. Internet connection check fails (""you are offline"") | Všechny porodní bolesti byly vychytány a vše funguje jak má...hned je tankování jednodušší :-). Ještě by to chtělo přehled pro business karty, aby člověk se dostal rovnou na portál a možnost odebrání Easy karty, když je tam i business. | Konečně! Dá se dobít kredit v aplikaci. Teď to nemá chybu. | Zamakali jste a nyní už můžu s klidem dát plný počet. Jen tak dál. | Paráda, všetko funguje | Už 5x jsem ověřil účet přes odkaz v emailu a stále se nejde přihlásit, stále mě aplikace žádá o ověření přes odkaz z emailu. | Dobíjení kreditů pomocí karty je konečně k dispozici! | Nefunguje přihlášení. Po přihlášení napíše, že je potřeba kliknout na link v emailu, ale po kliknutí na něj se pouze zobrazí chyba. Nejde se tak přihlásit. | Looks good and easy to use but unfortunately does not take BENEFIT/BUSINESS cards. | Great app. Very convenient to pay via QR code at the stand. Enjoyed it a lot with my easy tank card. Hope to see support for the benefit card as well some time soon 😉 | Mohlo by jít dobíjet přímo v aplikaci pomoci platební karty. | Konecne funguje platba Benzina kartou, co je jediny dovod instalovat tuto apku. Bohuzial, prevladol marketing nad zdravim rozumom. Stav na karte musite hladat niekde hlboko v menu. Namiesto toho, na uvodnej stranke mate nejaky blby stav Konikov. Inak apka robi co ma. Edited: stav karty uz je na homapage, takze menim na 5* | Po přidání podpory tank karty je aplikace super, takže měním hodnocení, funguje krásně i ve spojení s věrnostním programem. | Měním původní kritickou recenzi, sice to trvalo 2 roky, ale už jdou přidat tank-tank karty, lze vybrat čím platit, lze přidat i karty z jiného účtu. Víceméně vše důležité funguje.... Co by se dalo zlepšit - personifikace karet (popis nebo obrázek) aby člověk líp viděl, kterou kartou platí. | UPDATE: Můj návrh níže byl implementován. Moc si toho vážím, díky developerům.-KONEC UPDATE- Aplikace je super, uvítal jsem zavedení možnosti platby zákaznickou Tankartou. Bylo by ale dobré, kdybych si mohl na obrazovce ""Domů"" zobrazit zůstatek na kartě. Je to pro mne důležitější údaj, než např. zůstatek koníků. Teď musím jít do přehledu karet, abych zjistil, kolik mi ještě zbývá. Jinak bez chyby. | Super! | Nakŕmil som aplikáciu PINom, otiskom prsta, emailom, heslom, telefónnym číslom a potom mi oznámila že BUSINESS kartu pridať nevie. | Parádní aplikace a jeden z důvodů proč rád tankuji na Benzině. Placení Tank Kartou či platební kartou je super easy a tak rychlé až se občas divím, že za mnou nevyběhne obsluha kvůli odjíždění bez placení :) Chybí mi ještě dobíjení Tank Karty v appce a zobrazení cen pohonných hmot. Aplikaci oceníte nejvíce na Benzina Expres (kde nepochodíte bez fyzické platební karty) a také že nemusíte dovnitř s rouškou na klasických pumpách. | Super appka, používám neustale, dovnitr jdu pouze na vyzvednutí odměny za koniky. Nicméně mi chybi jedna věc - možnost dobití karty skrz aplikaci, i kdyby tam byly údaje k bankovnímu převodu, když by nešlo online dobití kartou, takhle znechuceně hledám na webovkach. Jakmile přidáte tuto možnost, hned mrsknu 5 hvězd, nemam co vytknout | Good app. Really appreciate to be able to pay without having to go inside the statuon. However, it is a pity that I cannot link my Benzina card to benefit from discounts. Isn't it strange that the Benzina app discourages using the Benzina card? | Spojení s tankart dobré, leč nedotažené k úplné dokonalosti. Pokud na android zařízení použiji dark mode, nedaří se čtečce načíst barcode. | smart app, easy to use. I recommend | Nápad s používáním karty je dobrý, aplikace funguje bez problémů. Je ale škoda, že tzv koníci nejsou načítáni i při pouhém placení kartou tank easy na pokladně. To je nedořešené otravovat obsluhu pro připsání. Rovněž ""dobíjení kreditu"" by mohlo být spojené třeba s virtuální peněženkou na telefonu a finance by mohly být na Tank Easy kartě hned. Jinak je převod minimálně 24h a musí se dobíjet zase na pokladně. | Aplikace podporuje Tank karty :)))) | Neplanujete přidat podporu Google pay namísto nutnosti ukládat si kartu do aplikace? | Bohužel aplikace tvrdí že jde platit tank-kartou easy. Není to pravda. Kartu mam nahranou do aplikace. Dnes jsem chtěl zaplatit u tankovaciho stojanu a nebylo možné v aplikaci tank-kartu vybrat a použít k placení. *************** Edit: kontaktovan helpdesk a vše uz funguje jak má ! | Poslední hvězdička přibude, když se bude dát easy karta ""nabít"" v apce. S tím něco udělejte, když už tam mám nahranou platební kartu. | Neuvěřitelné pomalé! 13.11.20 Nyní už funguje jak má. | Funguje bez problémů. Na placení od stojanu a navíc s využitím tank karty se snadno zvyká. | Super aplikace, urychlí tankování. | Přihlášení do účtu nefunguje. Není jasné jak přidat tank kartu. | Po poslední aktualizaci bylo placení dost nepřehledné - oproti klasickému naskenovaní kódu u stojanu jsem musel znovu zadávat kartu (a kdyby se nenosily roušky, šel bych k pokladně). I po přihlášení otiskem je v aplikaci tlačítko přihlásit/registrovat. Update: nejde mi přidat karta, píše to Bankovní karta s číslem *** byla odebrána pro překročení limitu počtu přidaných karet. | Zvyšuji na 2*. Za možnošt připojení TankKarty, ale jinak je stále na čem pracovat. Aplikace má problém s přihlášením k účtu. Někdy to trvá velmi dlouho a někdy to nejde vůbec (ohlásí to výpadek). Tajně jsem doufal, že bude možné dobíjet TankKartu v aplikaci přes platební bránu pomocí platební karty. Nejde to bohužel ani na webu. Převod z účtu je na houby, než se to připíše do účtu TankKarty trvá to nesmyslně dlouho. Tedy stále TankKarta = chození na pokladnu. Je to škoda. | Almost not usable for a week almost. Extremely slow, my cards have disappeared | K platební kartě nelze přidat ""přezdívka"" nebo vlastní označení pro jednoduché rozpoznání několika platebních karet. | Aplikaci jsem zatím bohužel nepoužil ani jednou. Hlavně chybí již tolikrát zmiňovaná integrace TankKarty. Mapa čerpacích stanic a aktuální ceny pohonných hmot by byly taky super. Zatím tedy pěkně k pokladně. Update 23.9.2020: Tak jsem se po roce těšil na intergraci tank karty, ale když se chci přihlásit, tak mi aplikace napíše chyba 1500 a to je vše. Už bych vám chtěl dát více hvězdiček :) Update 25.9.2020: Dobrý den, bohužel ani po updatu aplikace chyba 1500 při znaze o přihlášení nezmizela. Update 20.10.2020: Po delší době jsem zkusil přihlášení a již funguje. Přidávám hvězdičku a po vyzkoušení platby přes TankKartu v aplikaci přibudou další :) Update 23.10.2020: Dneska jsem konečně vyzkoušel platbu u stojanu přes aplikaci s TankKartou. Všechno v pohodě, sleva se uplatila :) Dávám čtyři hvezdičky. Dal bych pět, ale na webu jsem si zablokoval jednu kartu a stav se do aplikace ani po několika hodinách nepřenesl. | Pres obchodni podminky o 1000 radcich jsem se nedostal. TL;DR Cenu benzinu na stanicich se zrejme take nedozvim. Nemam zajem. | Chybi mi možnost dobiti tank karty online platebni kartou. | Parádní aplikace, díky za přidání tank karty teď už je perfektní. | Funguje v pořádku, rychle. Nemusela by tak vehementně cpát registraci, když jde fungovat i bez ní. Účtenka nejde přes Share uložit do Google Drive, což by se hodilo kvůli účetnictví (nebo prostě nemít soubory v telefonu). Also, Google Pay? :) | Bohužel neexistuje možnost dobití z aplikace | Not working after update. | Update 2:Aplikace se již zapne. Přihlásit se stále nešlo. Opakovaně jsem se zkoušel přihlásit a kliknout na potvrzení v mailu. Vždy to prý proběhlo v pořádku, ale aplikace stále chtěla znovu ověřovat mail. Když jsem zkusil otevřít email na telefonu a ne PC, už to šlo. Další problém je hned u přidání fyzické tank karty easy, kdy pořád vyskakuje chyba 50042. Navíc, na webu ani nejdou změnit údaje v profilu - ""Při komunikaci se serverem nastala chyba"". Už opravdu dost ztrácím zájem o tento produkt. | Finaly Tank Karta support! Works great, thanks! | Very helpful, use it on every refueling. No queues, especially these covid days.. Card hold stays way too long though. | I would love to use this app. However, it does not support the Tank Karta, so I cannot. | Přikláním se k názoru, prostě přidat slevu kterou dostanete platbou tank kartou, ke platbam prostřednictvím aplikace. Stejně celá myšlenka tank karty je jak z minulého století. Přijdu na kasu, nabiju kartu normální kartou a zaplatím tank kartou... | Když je pro vás přidání tank karty takový problém, vykašlete se na ni a místo toho prostě při platbě touto apkou dejte stejnou slevu jako při platbě tank kartou. Jediný důvod proč tu kartu mám je ta sleva, tak bych prostě místo karty používal apku. Easy squeezy a nestojí vás to nic na vývoji apky. | Myšlenka super, ale nepodporuje vernostní kartu (placení, dobijení kreditu). | Tank karta stale v nedohlednu, stale zapomina ulozenou platebni kartu.. kdyz zrovna funguje tak ok, ale kdyz pri kazdem pouziti musite znovu pridavat platebni kartu tak to se fakt pouzivat neda.. behem karanteny to bylo fajn. Clovek nemusel od auta a potkat se s pumparkou.. ale v soucasne chvili tahle vyhoda mizi.. | Aplikace stoji naprosto za nic, tedy konkrétně platby v aplikaci. Pokud zadáte částku pro tankování, řekněme 2000kc ale máte na účtu v tu chvíli pouze 1999kc, aplikace na uctu vyblokuje celou částku tedy 1999kc ovsem nedovolí vás natankovat ani litr. Toto se mi stalo opakovaně. Aktuálně mi Benzina takto dluží cca 1200kc. Edit: jednalo se o Benzinu express, tedy o stojany v Poděbradech kde je třeba nejdříve ""zaplatit"" a potom tankovat. | Platit QRkem je pěkné, ale dokud nebude aplikace umět tank kartu tak stejně musím chodit na pokladnu | Nepodporuje benzina kartu ani pre platbu a ani k uplatneniu zľavy za tankovanie - aktuálne nepoužiteľné. | Od doby, kdy app vyzaduje pri placeni zapnute GPS se z platby stala nocni mura. Telefon ktery nema v aute zaplou gps se pod strechou cerpacek s GPS tezko spojuje a z placeni se stava zdlouhava neprijemnost. | Až bude fungovat Tank Karta, dám plné hodnocení. Ani po roce a půl není implementována tank karta, takže dávám nejnižší hodnocení. | Neumožňuje platbu kartou benzina a neobsahuje ani ceny PHM, appka má teda nulovú pridanú hodnotu a pre verného zákazníka je nevyužiteľná. Edit: Sľuby o pridani možnosti platby kartou Benzina trvajú moc moc dlho, a stále je to ""zanedlho"". | Chybí propojení s dobíjecí kartou Benzina | Slibný začátek, ale ještě Vás čeká velká spousta práce, pro začátek aktuální informace o cenách na ČP by nemusel být tak velký challenge, pak přidání tank karty, nebo alespoň přehledu o zůstatku a možnost si dobít z již přidané karty | Zbytečná aplikace, protože nelze spojit s tank kartou. Tzn žádná sleva na palivo. | Good idea but still promising final solution. No possibility to use Tank karta, which is still described as 'to be done'. So the question is when do you plan to implement also Tank karta into this app? Tx. | Nelze spojit s Benzina kartou ani neposkytuje slevu na palivo.(kromě promo akce na verva diesel). | Benzina v Suchdole nefunguje, apka ji nabizi jako jine neexistujici Banziny, prosim o opravu Účty by bylo dobre mit moznost odeslat za kvartal, kdyz se dela DPH, dejte tam prosim skupinovy vyber a odeslani/ulozeni (do telefonu to nejde) at to neposilam po jedne... diky David | Nelze přidat tank kartu, takže zbytečné. | Aktualizace hodnocení po opravě chyb. Přetrvává nemožnost sparovat s kartou Benzina a nefunguje v PL. | Nyni jiz funguje. | Nefungovala a zrovna nebrali karty, musel jsem si jit vybrat hotovost.... | aplikace po spusteni napise Jste offlne a nelze ji tak pouzivat. Pripojeni k internetu mam (apka nefunguje ani na wifi, ani primo pres data), chyba na vice typech mobilu. | Just downloaded the app and seems a promising one, if functionality is kept up to the exigencies of such a modernizing vision. Also, it avoids us having to face some of your cashiers, who are not always welcoming at all, with their locked up faces & attitudes. Other thing that would be a revolution is partnering with other payments options & companies, like Sodexo which offers cafeteria Account to employers for their staff. This pays in spa, gym & other places, besides food Acct, why not fuel. | Marketak od benziny tu robi zlu reklamu. Tvrdit platte kartou cez appku sice bez zlavy ale za to o par sekund rychlejsie nedava zmysel. (update) Trva vam to dlho. Privelmi(update) Teraz vie aplikacia vyhladat benzina cerpacie stanice na ktorych nemozete platit benzina kartou z appky (rozumej vsetky). | Tak máme začátek února a platby tank kartou nebo sleva přes appku stále nic... Tomu říkám ""co nejdříve""... EDIT: máme listopad a hádejte co se změnilo? Nic, i ty sliby jsou pořád stejně plané... | Bez pridania tank karty nepoužiteľné. | Nepodporuje vlastní kartu. Nepochopitelné. | Aplikace funguje jak je slibováno. Vítám systém placení až po natankování. Oproti konkurenčnímu řešení kde se blokuje částka je toto daleko lepší. Mám ale 2 výtky - 1.) Ne všechny čerpací stanice podporují Benzina platby a byl bych rád za nějaký seznam kde je platba tímto způsobem dostupná a tu bych v daném městě mohl upřednostnit. 2.) Zbavte se prosím těch UI prvků z iOS od Applu, především vyskakovacích nabídek a podobně - Material design Androidu je fajn tak proč ho nepoužít. Díky! | Pro běžné platby vypadá hezky, pro věrné klienty, kteří používají TankKartu je to k ničemu. Jakmile přijde verze s podporou TankKarty, pak to bude výborná aplikace. Kdy to ale bude? | Jak jste daleko s přidáním té Tank karty? | It's a great app but It's missing 2 critical features. It needs to support TankKarta and Google Pay | Nepodporuje platby Benzina Tank kartou - nepochopitelne, nepouzitelne. | Načo aplikácia, keď neumožňuje pridať benzina kartu :( | if the security code can only be numbers,why doest the input field open qwertz keyboard? i had to take my gloves off because of this..but overal the experience was better than queuing for 10 minutes behind people ordering food... | Its f...

Apps and give a bad rate.Its bloody sh...t.Hope I will never hear again about stupid Benzina. | Nemusim kvuli placeni chodit od stojanu. Super! | Stáhl jsem si dneska při tankování. Super, že je možné platit hned u stojanu, ale nevím, jestli mi aplikace vystaví daňový doklad do účetnictví. Umí to nebo ne? Bez toho by to bylo k ničemu. Ptal jsem se na to hned u pokladny Benziny pán řekl, že vůbec neví, že se ho na to nikdo neptal. Čekal bych proškolenější personál, když se to tak propaguje. Díky za odpověď. | Bez možnosti platby tank kartou je to aplikace naprosto k ničemu. Ve srovnání s ostatními systémy mobilních plateb chudý příbuzný.

Vždyť mi to hlásí, že stačí ukázat ten QR kód. | The app is great and the update is commendable | My jsme cekali na vlak z ceskeho krumlova do volar ten vlak mel prijet v 19.03 ale melo to zpozdeni 15 minut a za 5 min tam bylo zpozdeni 20min takze to melo prijet v 19.23 ale! Ono to prijelo v 19.19hodin neslyseli jsme nic a ten se ani nezastavil pak nam rekl securitak ze jsme meli pockat venku ale kdyz byla strasna zima a my jsme cekali v cekarne tak na co je dpc cekarna a ten ridic vubec nemohl zastavit a pockat do toho casu 19.23 ale ne proste to odjelo vubec se ten vlak nezastavil hrozny! | Většinou funguje v pořádku ale musíte se smířit s tím že si občas strhne peníze za jízdenku kterou vám pak v systému už nikdy neukáže, přestože v internetovém bankovnictví je částka jasně odečtena, někdy i několikrát. Za cenu ""vyhozené"" stovky nebo dvou čas od času ale přeskočíte stání v řadě u okýnka na nádraží. | easy to use | Aplikace ukládá nastavení ""počet osob"". Úspěšně jsem si koupil dvě jízdenky místo jedné. Pěkná funkce. | doesn't work | Chyby v aplikaci, a neumi zobrazit mapku pro vyber sedadla, ac tu moznost nabizi... | am I in 2013??? | Nelogické řazení zakoupených lístků. Mám za poslední den dva 4-5 lístků a ten první nahoře je ten nejstarší? | Po dvou letech používání jsem zjistil, že mi automaticky účtujete plnou částku za jízdenky, přestože mám koupenu ""in kartu 25"". Jízdenky si kupuji na své jméno a očekával bych, že se sleva započte, když je také na mé jméno. jaký význam má pak mít na to aplikaci? přišel jsem tak o tisíce a zaplatil vám navíc za nefunkční slevu. Tato aplikace se zdá navržena tak, aby nutné kroky navíc snížili pravděpodobnost, že uživatel slevu dokáže využít. | they can't get their trains on time | K dokonalosti chybí jen tmavé schéma. | Velice praktické | zlatá aplikace | na zpozdeny vlak si jizdenku nekoupim - aha ? pribehnu na nadrazi, skocim do vlaku a chci si na nej koupit listek - v aplikaci haha tuudle nuudle, kup si panacku u stiplistka... | Po poslední aktualizaci aplikace celkem funguje ale nechápu proč když měsíční studentská na přepážce stojí 465 tak proč v aplikaci stojí 630. Také bych celkem uvítal možnost nahrát papírovou jízdenku do aplikace jelikož papírová jelikož text na papírové jízdence má po týdnu tendenci vyblednout k nepřečtení | Super aplikace, má ale jeden zásadní nedostatek. Při nakupu jízdenky a platbě kartou není možné ručně zkontrolovat certifikát platební brány. Jak má pak člověk vědět, kam zadává číslo své karty? Lepší varianta by byla, kdyby se při platbě otevřel systémový prohlížeč. | Uz umi google pay. Super | When are you smart people going to realize we need more wagons and that your trains are overbooked? Do you have any issues with your online systems that don't show how many booking you have? | Aplikácia väčšinu času funguje bez problémov, prekvapuje ma ale spôsob hodnotenia cesty po ukončení jazdy - možnosť udelenia hviezd za dané (trochu irelevantné) kategórie bez možnosti komentáru České dráhy nijak neposunie dopredu. Bolo by vhodnejšie dať cestujúcim možnosť vyjadriť sa, čo sa im páčilo/nepáčilo. | 👍nice one | Update 09/2023: nad Moje jízdenky projistotu břibyl další link... Po posledních aktualizacích je záložka Jízdenky divná - otvírá ""Moji In Kartu"" a dříve jednoduše dostupné jízdenky (důležité zejména pro zobrazení místenky a řazení vlak) jsou ted skryte pod titěrným klikacim textem ""Moje jízdnenky"". (A te obrazovce moje jízdenky dominuje odporně velký zbytečný banner ""přihlášen jako"" s mým jménem!?! A počtem bodů). Stal se snad z této části aplikace jen zobrazovač univerzálního kusu webu? | Často se stává, že se jízdenka nenahraje do hlavního QR kódu, průvodčí načte pouze kupón inKarty a je nutné ukázat jízdenku zvlášť. Novinkou je problematické placení, kdy po potvrzení v bankovnictví a ťuknutí na Secure tlačítko Visy se proces zasekne, částka je zablokováná a lístek nezakoupený. | After last update, where payments via Google Pay can be done directly in the app, it seems this fixed lot of failed payments and missing tickets for me. | Skvělá appka. Přehledná, jednoduchá a funkční. | Pozor na volbu vice cestujících.. V rychlosti jsem přidal dalsi radky a ve vlaku nemile zjistil, že jsem přidal různé slevové jízdné... | Není možné vytvořit virtuální InKartu. Aplikace píše ""Pro daný e-mail bylo již vytvořeno příliš mnoho účtů"" a není zřejmé, co dál dělat. Nefunguje ani platba uloženou kartou, protokol mujvlak:// není rozpoznaný. Dříve aplikace fungovala bez chyb, teď je pro mě nepoužitelná. Edit: platba kartou funguje po odstranění dříve uložené karty, která od té doby expirovala. Měním hodnocení na 2 hvězdy, protože s tím aspoň jde něco dělat, i když aplikace neřekne, co. | Nedokaze vyhledat spojeni s vylukovymi autobusy. Napr. nyni Linz-Obertraun vytrvale zene pres Salzburg a Steinach-Irdning, prestoze existuje primy vlak OEBB v casti nahrazeny vylukovym autobusem. Navic neumi prodat jizdenky. Loni je aplikace umela. Doporucujete aplikaci mistniho dopravce - jenze jde o mezinarodni jizdenky zacinajici v Praze. Loni jsem kupoval pres mujVlak, letos to slo jen pres OEBB. Ano, i OEBB jsem musel.premlouvat, ze chci pres CB a ne Viden. Ale tam to alespon pomohlo. | the easiest rail software I've ever used (and I've used approx 10). this approach deserves to be used by other countries and become the standard | price changes every time you open the app | Nová sleva na Liftago působí jako reklama na nepraktickém místě. Obzvláště s více jízdenkami. Odcenil bych možnost v nastavení, aby se nezobrazovala. | Aplikace funguje hezky, intuitivní a nepadá, ale jediné co mi chybí je zobrazení jídelního lístku | very functional app, a bit rough on the UI/IX, but I happily use it for my travels around Czechia | Looking for the platform number could not find | Excellent! Great interface easy to use Lovely to look at! Thank you!!! | good | I absolutely love this app. It has so much useful info and is more up to date than the info boards at train stations. 6/5 stars | Appka supr, ale chybí v ní jakákoli možnost zpětné vazby na konkrétní spoj, takže: proč musí být ve vagónech 369-367 spojů R9 Praha-Brno, které mají klimatizaci, 15 stupňů? Venku třicet a do vlaku aby člověk lezl v mikině. | Za poslední dva týdny mi aplikace zablokovala 2000 Kč bez vydání jízdenek. | Prosím přidat možnost koupit jízdenku jestli vlak už odjel. Teď funguje tak že jestli jsem nasoupil do vlaku na poslední chvíli není možné už jízdenku koupit (tlačítko nákupu mizí). Jinak funguje dobře. | purchased ticked, no sign of it. | crashing | Nefunkčnost google pay - platba potvrzena ale můj vlak ji nepotvrdí a nedostanu tak ani jízdenku... Nutnost použít platební kartu. | Super aplikace, akorát nerozumím řazení zakoupených jízdenek - úplně nahoře je včerejší jízdenka a dnešní až pod ní... Čekal bych, že aktuální jízdenka bude na prvním místě | Do not use. Purchases tickets from other companies for double the price. Fine if you're only going on CD trains. | One star for live train times and delays. Unfortunately the app is very unreliable and badly implemented, especially if you want to buy tickets. It blocks the money in your account, but there is no ticket and you don't have any feedback if it worked or not. So the buying is complete useless and will definitely gets you into trouble with no ticket riding if you use this app for tickets. | Dobrý | It made me buy the ticket twice, because couldn't verify rhe payment first. Of course my money is gone, and there is no receipt, nothing about about the first payment. Only my missing money. Never use this scam application! | občas se mi stává, že koupím jízdenku, peníze odejdou, ale jízdenka se v aplikaci nezobrazí | Defaultne filtruje pouze business jízdenky! | Jízdenku jsem zaplatil, peníze byly z účtu rezervovány, ale jízdenku jsem v aplikaci ani v e-mailu neobdržel. | GooglePay not working this afternoon, tried 3x, had to pay extra fee in the train | Broken for so long already, the chance your payment goes through is like 1 in 10, both Google pay and card. | Zaplatit jízdenku je samotný teror, 9 pokusů a platební brána ze strany ČD pořád blokuje mojí platbu. Občas vám platba projde, ale jízdenka nikde. | good | Dlouhy zvuk notifikace, dnes 'prosim aktualizujte z obcohud play', pritom mam aktualni, vcera aktualizovanou verzi, v obchode zadna novejsi nebyla. | After latest update application crashes few seconds since has been launched. | Very good | could be better, I miss dark mode but that's ok. | Cannot pay with credit card or Google pay. Used to happening before, appear to be fixed, but happens again | It gets the job done. A must have if you plan to travel by train. | Used to be a pretty decent app. This morning tried to buy ticket. App does not accept credit cards, shows error. Went to train station, bought ticket and paid extra 35 czk for seat reservation on top of inconvenience. Thank you for a quick fix! App works perfectly now after update! | Ani mi neodejde platba. Jednou se mi stalo že platba sice odešla, ale jízdenka se nezobrazila 🤡 ještě k tomu gpay v prohlížeči? Vážně? | Did not work with GooglePay on Android. | Naprostá notifikacni katastrofa. Nic nejde vypnout. | it is really helpful app and assistant so you can travel all over Europe with less cost and enjoyment | Use the IDOS app it's way better, but this also works. | To houkání mě vytáčí. Kdyby aplikace nehoukala, dám 5 hvězd. | Constantly nags you about stupid sh#@ while you desperately try to buy last minute ticket. Like this ""rate us"" prompt. | Super appka | nutí mě hodnotit aplikaci během používání aplikace. | Placení Google pay je nespolehlive. U jinych prodejcu nemam zadny problem s prubehem platby, jen tady projde az na podruhe a ne vzdy mi prijde jizdenka | Taking in account other supposedly free applications tha I as a Czech citizen have to pay for no matter if I use them or not - this one is slightly better then the one by DPP Prague. Still, unsolicited advertising and notifications that can't be disabled simply aren't acceptable under any circumstances. | Je fajn že tam je vše ale co mi to je platné když to píše zpoždění a pak zjistím že to jelo na čas. Plus kde se dá stornovat lístek když už si zaplatím lístek a stane se tohle tak bych ho rád stornoval. Nemluvě o tom že to nenapíše když vlak je jiného typu než máte lístek koupený a v aplikaci vám to neřeknou krásných 100 korun v (ha#%lu) děkuji. | The app cancelled my ticket by itself, without any notification. Would not use this again | Příjemná, snadno použitelná aplikace – uvítala bych možnost koupit lístek na zpožděný vlak po času pravidelného odjezdu a integraci Google Pay (úplnou, ne přesměrování na webové rozhraní). Bylo by také fajn upozorňovat na odstávky, občas se prostě appka tváří, že já nejsem online (jsem), aniž by někde byla informace, že od–do bude aplikace mimo provoz. | Poslední aktualizace rozbila funkcionalitu kontroly jízdenky přes NFC, předtím to roky fungovalo. Proč? | Aplikace je užitečná a z technického hlediska+ UI je celkem v pořádku. Rychlost jednotlivých úkonů je adekvátní & notifikace i e-maily doručené správně. Online rezervace a jízdenky v mobilu jsou teď jednodušší po zrušení - ne zcela logické - povinnosti předložení občanky, takže stačí ukázat QR kód v telefonu. Asi to nemá s apkou co dělat ale nebývám šťastným když mám jízdenku i s místenkou ale zjistit na nástupišti, že konkrétní číslo sedadla ani vozu neexistuje = chaos a nepříjemná komplikace | Často nefunguje... | Transakční brána nefunguje tak jak má, z mě neznámého důvodu a díky tomu jsem uvízl, protože mi ujel vlak. Jinak fajn aplikace | aplikace je nepřehledná a uživatelsky nepřátelská..... bez vysvětlení se dějou věci , které uživatel nechce, například je manipulován k zakoupení tarifu , který nechce !! Na cd inkartě je desetkrát ověřená totožnost majitele , a přesto průvodčí ve vlaku znovu vyžaduje další průkaz !!! pro ČD je zákazník zřejmě nepřítel .... | Absolutely usseless app, with customer support that prefers to lecture on the terms and conditions instead of making sure that the user experience is clear enough so that you don't end up making stupid mistakes. Maybe because those also happen to make them money. | Not a terrible app, however it does have a couple of flaws. For example, the ticket cannot be bought after scheduled departure time, even if the train is delayed. | Ve za s# | Hi, app is not bad ,but in case you are tight with budget and you changed your mind to replace older ticket for other and get refund,be ware of long time to add your money on account if you paid with Atm card or you don't have Czech ATM card, otherwise you like foreigner you can wait 3-6 days to get refunded..it's more simple with credit with you top up and refund should be back instantly.. funny is that also on station by window they cant do nothing with that , i mean to print you new ticket | problem s placením za lístek jsem musela zaplatit dvakrát a teď budu zdlouhavé čekat na vratku | Good | Přepínání mezi stranami pomocí menu dole zapomíná stav, což je vážně frustrující, když potřebujete cokoliv dohledat k existujícím lístkům. Pro zachování duševního zdraví je potřeba v systému přenastavit zvuk notifikace na defaultní, v aplikaci to nejde (leda si užíváte úchylné troubení vlaku každých 5 minut když se změní zpoždění). Jinak docela rozumná aplikace. | Neukazuje ceny! | Výborná aplikace pro cestování vlaky ČD | Som prekvapena, ze je to tak dobre funkcna aplikacia, ma to inkartu, informácie o vlaku, meskani, prehlad tabule na ktorejkolvek stanici a dokonca aj pocasie. Kupovanie listkov je prehladne a jednoduche. Nie som velky fanusik notifikacii, ale tu mi pridu uzitocne, napisu, na ake nastupiste vlak pride alebo kedy mate vystupit, je to super. | Opravdu povedená, super aplikace! Vše funguje jak má, má spoustu funkcí, vše je tam, kde bych to čekal. Na poměry Českých drah něco neuvěřitelného. | Vcelku ok, co me ale neskutečně vytáčí je změna jasu displeje u qr kódu. Chápu proč to tam je, ale nechci to, sam si zvýším jas pokud bude potřeba. Nebo by bylo dobré aspon přesunout jízdenky jinam, abych se k nim nemusel dostavat přes tu stránku s qr kódem a nevypalovalo mi to pokaždé večer oči. | Vše funguje bez problému, jen by se hodilo, pokud by obsah notifikace byl i při více notifikacích čitelný i bez prokliknutí. Umožnilo by to její přečtení i třeba na hodinkách. | A quick and easy way to buy train tickets in the Czech Republic. The English language version is very useful for visitors. | Aplikace je až překvapivě funkční. Akorát teda nechápu tu obsesi pojmenovat aplikaci tak, aby ji nebylo možné najít. Proč se to nemůže jmenovat České dráhy, nebo to nemá v názvu aspoň ČD aby byla aplikace v mobilu nějak normálně vyhledatelná, pro lidi co ji nepoužívají denně? | A completely shameful organisation that charges 3€ arbitrary cancelation fee and has the audacity to claim a quarter of a year as a valid period for returning your money to your account. Unbelievable. | Chyby při placení. Nešlo to uloženou kartou, ani přes google pay. | App is very complex and complicated. User needs to be patient and give it a chance, it gets better with time. But I have one major problem, Google Pay integration is just like any other card integration, there is no added value in it. Why it is not connected to integrated Google Pay in Android system, where you don't have to login a verify every transaction on web and mobile banking app. How is it possible that, you can integrate the ""right and simple"" way on iOS but not on Android? | Very useful. Real-time information about delays plus many more. | Very easy app | Aplikaci používám několik let a jsem s ní maximálně spokojen. Nákup lístků, rezervace popřípadě rušení - vše probíhá bez problémů. Dále platební možnosti a plánování budoucích výletů - i do zahraničí. 🙂 Několikrát jsem potřeboval změnit email v aplikaci, po kontaktování IT oddělení, vše proběhlo bez problémů. Co je také možné, je změna jazyka - český nebo anglický. Obecně vzato, aplikace funguje rychle a bez problémů. Palec nahoru dávám. 😉 | Although the app makes it very easy to find suitable connections and tickets, very often it does not show the operational delays, possible transfers and the changes in the route. | Doufám, že člověk, který zrušil výběr místenky z plánku, dostal padáka. | Nejhorší dopravce ever, má klasický spoždění 5-10 minut!🤬 Není schopnej počkat ani 30 vteřin na nástup do vlaku! Vlak přijede na druhej konec nástupiště, běžím za ním, a strojvůdce, ten největší kokot mi úmyslně zavře dveře před očima!😡🤬🤬🤬 A ani výluka 5 vlaku za sebou a čekání z pravidla několika hodin není výjimkou! Chtějí po vás koupit lístek i v případě že máte už týden z aktivovanou lítačku! Udělejte s tím bože něco! | Koupil jsem si jízdenku přes appku, 10 min před odjezdem jsem chtěl upgrade do první třídy. Přes ""změnit/zrušit"" mi appka nabídla pouze storno. Tak jsem stornoval a koupil nový lístek do 1.třídy. Pak mi přijde e-mail, že storno bylo možné max 15min před odjezdem. Bylo by dobré, kdybyste toto zavedli přímo do aplikace, abych si nemohl stornoval jízdenku, když už to vaše smluvní podmínky nedovolují. Rozhodně by to bylo více user friendly. | GORGEOUS | - It is not possible to tick ""Direct connections only"" without opening the settings below. - There is no option to turn off the automatic brightness adjustment when viewing the QR code, so it blinds you when you buy tickets in the evening. - It sometimes suggests completely random stations I've never visited. - It probably doesn't use your phone's location so it once suggested me the stations in the opposite order, so I had a ticket in the opposite direction. - The app doesn't have a dark mode!! | Add the possibility to scan the paper ticket's qr code and then use the app instead of the paper ticket. | Very much uset friendly user interface for the Czech ráilway transport. | no chance to reserve return ticket | Very easy to find connections and book tickets. | Apka je vesmes dobra, nekde mozna zbytecne preplacana, uzitecne informace lehce zapadnou(napr. Vyluky by mohli byt prehlednejsi). Vazne bych uvital,aby listky nad urcitou hodnotu meli automaticky zdarma mistenku(bud si vyberu nebo mi je system priradi). Jezdim pres 4 hodiny s pritelkyni k rodicum a kdyz zapomenu vybrat mista,tak zpetne si je musim za 70kc dokoupit. | Ztratil jsem penize kvuli chybejicimu spoji v teto aplikaci (behem srovnani s IDOSem, kde ve stejnou dobu tam byl hodne podobny spoj, ale delsi trasa). | Můžu s velkou přesností sledovat zpoždění svého vlaku 10/10 | App works okay. But, I would immensely appreciate if there would have been an option about the direction of the train when purchasing the ticket. This is like shooting in the dark for someone who suffers from motion sickness. Overall, notifs come on time more or less. Add an arrow of the direction and it will be 5*. | Úžasná aplikace, všechno skvělý, živý pozice vlaku (zatím ne na mapě, ale podle stanice), plánovač kterej prostě funguje (narozdíl od jiných), jediný co nefunguje jsou odjezdy že stanic které nejsou v ČR (ale to se dá pochopit), a taky nemůžu sledovat živě vlaky které nejsou od ČD (ale to se zase dá pochopit). A taky žádné reklamy. | Great app, but recently it's not possible to pay with Google pay. | Dneska 27.8.2022 mám pocit že máte nějaký problém. Furt je napsáno chyba komunikace se serverem. I když klasický web funguje dobře. Je to tak? | super apka, vše funguje jak má | Poněkud nepřehledná appka, ale funkce tam jsou dobré a funguje spolehlivě. | nice app | Useful, logic, simple. | Funkční ale omezená. Lze vyhledávat spojení a kupovat jízdenky pouze pro ČD. Nelze stornovat pouze jednoho pasažéra, nutno vrátit celou jízdenky nejpozději den předem a koupit znovu. Hodně štěstí pokud na vás zbyde místenka. Asi lepší kupovat jízdenky jednotlivě, dokud se nad tím ČD nezamýslí, ale stále jako faktický monopol, proč by se obtěžovali. Používejte raději IDOS, který vám najde i kombinované spojení s busem či konkurenci. | Ukazujete neexistující vlaky, doporučuje přestupní vlaky které ve stanici kde vystupujem ani nezastavují. Často nezobrazí výluku ale vlaky které by jeli kdyby nebyla. Za spoždění 3+hodin by se i na iredo jízdenky mělo vztahovat nějaké finanční odškodnění. Když se vlak spoždí třeba přes hodinu a jízdenka nám kvůli tomu v posledním spoji časově nevyjde, tak to není chyba nás, proto by se měla udělat alespoň nějaká výjimka když už musíte mít pokaždé spoždění. | Ostatní u nás by se mohli učit jak to má vypadat | Bloody charlatans - I paid the money and no ticket arrived. So I've been forced to buy another one. Damn robbery. | Ze jsou stránky českých drah šílené není tajemství, ale vypustit aplikaci, která se při nákupu nenačítá a hází errory aniž by vysvětlila co je špatně je troufalé. | Skvělé pro zjištění aktuálních výluk a zpoždění, ale při nákupu jízdenek aplikace pohořela. Nepodporuje ""vestavěný"" Google Pay a posílá na internetovou platební bránu, což zabere spoustu času a na mobilu je velmi nepraktické. Raději zůstanu u OneTicket. | Ok | is friendly app, and fast. | User friendly app. Easy and reliable. | App doesnt communicate with the server. It is useless now, cannot search connections or even log in. | Working good and is simply to use - for me the interface ia customer friendly. It had a Czech and an English version as well and the app informa the travellers about news regarding the train. | Good | Great app. Very useful for booking tickets , seat reservations, upgrades. I haven't had a problem reserving seats. If it's all blocked out in red. Check the class of the coach. | Awesome app | Absolutely horrible app | Otřesná nová podoba, nepřehledné, crashuje při koupi jízdenek. | Reliable app BUT I'd you own a lidacka use the PID lidacka app since it is often cheaper to buy their travel passes. You still need this app to by transit fir bikes though.","{""1"":2476,""2"":724,""3"":1863,""4"":6494,""5"":30005}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","České dráhy, a.s.","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9+dr%C3%A1hy,+a.s.","mujvlak@gmail.com","http://www.cd.cz/",,"https://www.cd.cz/e-shop/o-eshopu/-30156/","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9+dr%C3%A1hy,+a.s.","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Of_LXw48h6Ld9zALE253MUN5flEt4Xl5YNdeKLJzRkXxjbv6N0D1zQfa-rcMjrJ9OGZC","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oMA9FplYai5WLX0aA0O20HdBuw9yFTyRhihxl6_sfo9ne8oWYqdXB5btesKYGWIA7k0","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rE8orflEubtTrF5ajhm1LoKI-ZZJ4lkcnvMiOrZM0efEPYI8TPuAuABwL0P-WOpuOQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9rGt7oHRhGYBGcUZjXawHA9dINuZHiqabfvBc8ry3Jm5Rel26sQcGnR6AiUEq2J8vLc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VkTA74fy6tE-osbrt9spWdwauZXDBxN4b54zLuWftn_EIYut_FkeACKH3t38Dw6KlS0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1ABJ3SvV35eqEqLGMjt6b9-yFaT8G7uMSXnxeMtaWGnlXHRxtOeBdS7mXaxXqE171Bk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GUEGsHOpvAHw30K6BEYslEu7tA3K5KSY-2aMLE-Bu4W3dfnxxZSqeYCGxlB5NFUIQQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-1U7fG20wDcj0pFeXHCqkp7sa64suEtBEY-iR641AP3lONhbfeDBN5VusKox84jOjQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-KdVjEkesvAmvDgzKOezlyq15Rxh8oZVtIo9FsCxNQg7QWAZbNqUN0UIi-S5zayxPtI""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8RPnkusH3U?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oMA9FplYai5WLX0aA0O20HdBuw9yFTyRhihxl6_sfo9ne8oWYqdXB5btesKYGWIA7k0",,"PEGI 3",,false,"Oct 29, 2014",1704282682000,"2.11.2","1.

Highly recommended. | All bought items get added to faves automatically, cannot turn it off. Makes maintaining faves hard. | My favourite app for buying groceries and toiletries in Czechia. Easy to use and search in English. Delivery service is far more professional than most other couriers - polite and friendly. Happy to pay a premium for a greater variety of choice. Keep it up! | Always great service and great products | V poslední době aplikace po startu zůstává viset ve stavu Loading (logo s rohlíkem a nekonečný progress). Děje se to i s verzí v únoru 2024. Vždy pomůže aplikaci zavřít a znovu otevřít. | Some things in the app are slow or flickering, but pretty nice app and service overall. | super | Categories could be better. Also, sort option would be nice to see cheaper options or the highest discounts etc. it is good that there is EN option in the app | Dobrá aplikace. Běží a vyhledává rychle a relativně inteligentně. Kategorie jsou super když hledáte něco neobvyklejšího. Hodil by se filtr na ""skladem"" protože semtam vyprodané položky jsou na prvních 20 místech | Easy to use and great app. | Skvělá apka, není nic moc co vytknout. pokud rádi používáte rohlík k nákupu, tak tato apka určitě potěší | This is a great app and service - the app tells you to the closest 5 mins when the shopping will arrive. | Super aplikace, jednoduše se ovládá a můžu nakupovat i z postele. | App crashes all the time saying I am not connected to the internet, while I obviously am. | poměrně nepřehledné, nejde rychlém filtrovat podle ceny... reklama slíbí dovezeme dnes do 20:00 a před platbou máte na výběr pouzee termíny na následující den... | Terrible navigation! Use the windows browser instead | Yay, it's in English now. App works perfectly fine and is easy to use | Vazim si vsech, kteri se neboji, v dnesni dobe podnikaji a delaji to velmi dobre. Navic jsou i solidarni a v dobe po tornadu na Jizni Morave rozvazeli potrebnym jidlo i piti. Drobne chybky se vloudi, ale resi je okamzite. 100% 5 hvezd! | top | Je to velice užitečná aplikace. | Aplikace není špatná, ale má dva zásadní nedostatky: 1) nemá tmavý režim (ten bílý design večer hrozně svítí) 2) během nakupování není vidět, za kolik mám zatím nakoupeno. | they have a great selection | great, reliable and convenient. | Při používání appky mám trochu divný pocit. Horizontální scrollovani je dost přísné. Data se občas načítají pomalu. Kliky (úprava množství, přidat do košíku, odstranit zboží) nepříjemně laguji. Služba jako celek je skvělá. | Rohlík oceňuji kvůli ochotným laskavým řidičům, nemusím tahat nákupy. Mají slušný výběr bio potravin. Za výborný nápad považuji recepty se seznamem ingrediencí, které si hned můžete přidat do košíku. Také oceňuji snahu o zodpovědné chováni související s udržitelným způsobem života. | velice užitečná služba, navíc dobře zorganizovaná. | aplikace je celkem funkční a má vše dobře zobrazitelne, akorát má dostatek technických problémů. když chci něco odstranit ze svého košíku tak mi neodstraní rovnou a musím čekat, nebo někdy to vůbec neodstraní. taky při scrollovani má hodně lagu, někdy musím čekat 3-4 sekundy než to zase je v pohodě. | keeps on reloding quite often on Android phone | Now with English. Perfect! App is easy to use, they refund when products are bad or missing. In general I prefer it to supermarket, although the minimum price to deliver at home is a bit too high now. Next improvement steps would be to increase Rohlik point distribution. Great job! | Rychlý a jednoduchý nákup | excellent service, always 10/10, never disappointed | Pozor na pokladně, podvodníci. Zkontrolujte ceny zboží při check out-u. Často všímám že zboží za, například 49,- v košíku má už jinou cenu 67,- (mám screenshoty). Žádné akce nebo podmínky na nákup více kusů při tom nejsou. Ostuda 🤢 | easy to use . some time it takes longer time to load. | Great shopping app, improving continuously. | great | skvela appka, lidi prijemny, do obchodu uz nepotrebujem, ani ty ceny nejsou spatny | SMS o českém příjezdu řidiče chodí jak se jim zachce. Nabízíte organicky pěstované plodiny a doručujete je v obalech z neorganického papíru. | Scam | Jak webovky tak aplikace absolutně nesmyslně organizované. Vynucené rozřazení do pod-kategorií a zákaz řádění dle svého (celé kategorie), aby si člověk nedejbože neuvědomil, kolik co stojí, dokáže udělat z 20min nákupu 35min bojování s UI které má heslo ""anti-user design"" vytetované na čele. | Bez debat 5***** sluzba! | A handy App when you need a quick order or just putting together a shopping list. | Výborná služba. Kurýři jsou flexibilní. | Skvělá služba a hezky navržená aplikace. Skvělé je řazení podle jednotky a chytře zvolené filtry. Reaguje taky na dietní omezení jako ""keto"" ""bez lepku"" atd. Aplikace má někdy tendenci neaktualizovat ceny a prodávat zboží, které již není na skladě. Je pak nutný restart. Zboží v košíku zůstane. | Po posledním updatu se něco nepovedlo, ceny neodpovídají (akce při přidání do košíku zmizí), nebo zboží najednou není k dispozici. | it's pretty easy to find and order with. I only wish it had an option for switching languages but that's not picking. | It's getting better and better. | V nové verzi jsou fonty miniaturní a nerespektují systémové nastavení, tedy nedají se změnit. | Good, easy to use. The English version is very helpful. | The app keeps crashing on my oneplus phone. | Nebyl zadny problem natukat cely nakup. | skvělá aplikace i služba | funguje super | Unable to open it since the last update. Every time I restart data /wifi keeps repeating that ""it stopped working,"" so I have to force it off. | App just endlessly loads. It used to work before | Super eshop se spoustou vyrobku, spolehlivy rozvoz, prijemni ridici. Pro cetsi nakupy se urcite vyplati. | it wouldnt hurt to have more slots for express delivery if you pay premium. Prices are high, but nice variety. | The app is easy to navigate, even before there was an English version I was able to use the app without issues, things I want to get to are in places that make sense. | Never got SMS for rohlik point, every time I need to contact support! Switching to Košík | Vyhledávání Vám zase nefunguje! A kategorie se nikdy nenačtou. ""Jejda, něco se pokazilo..."" Jak mám u Vás proboha nakupovat? Nepřestává mne fascinovat, jak se dá něco dříve funkčního takhle zfušovat... | Vyprodane zbozi, jako pecivo, neni mozne objednat ani na nasledujici den. | Appka NEMA tmavy profil | Rohlik jako služba je skvělý ale tato aplikace je šílená a plná chyb. | Nelze doplnit objednávku i když zavoláte ihned po jejím odeslání. | App works great | Super, pouzivam casto | There's no English version and that pretty much concludes my review. | Rohlík je nejlepší! 😉 | Pretty good service. Quality of the food is overall satisfying. However it would be good to have more pick up points in Brno, as it was before. Now it seems like only delivery option is available... | Přidání kategorií do oblíbených položek je fakt strašný, absolutně nepoužitelný. Doufám že vrátíte jednoduchý seznam. | Za mě super služba, šetří mi spoustu času a ceny považuji za srovnatelné s běžným nákupem - za předpokladu, že jeden neobjíždí akce... | It crushes very often | appka funguje bez problemu, super stejne jak pres web | No English version available, seems like a good app, but without proper internationalization it's so hard for an expat to use. | Categories, search.. Loading forever and not working. Making an order is a suffering. | konečně to ma opakování nákupu, ale nejsou vidět podobné vyrobky, copiruj Košík 😆 | Po update apka nejde spustit | I just downloaded the app, and have been scrolling through to find the feature that allows the language change, cant find the slot to change to English. | Wir haben heute das erste Mal via App bestellt und sind total begeistert und zufrieden. Die Lieferung war pünktlich der Service freundlich. Die Lieferung erfolgte direkt an die Wohnungstür und alles war frisch und wurde so geliefert wie bestellt | prehledne, mnohem rychlejsi nez web, ja su spokojene | Cannot change app language, all items names in shop are inherited from device language. | Obecně delší response, dlouho načítá, někdy přidané zboží z košíku ""zmizí"", někdy mizí zboží ""pod rukama"" (vložíte do košíku a po přechodu do košíku je najednou zboží vyprodané), někdy mazání textu nereaguje na backspace . Nelze nastavit jazyk jiný než je jazyk systému - v české appce nechci mix umělého polopřekladu do AJ a češtiny, jen proto, že systém mám v jeho přirozeném jazyce 🤦🏼‍♀️ | Nejde přepnout z angličtiny do češtiny, pokud je systémový jazyk angličtina. Od poslední rozbité verze s loadovací lištou, která tu byla od začátku a nedařilo se ji dlouho (roky?) opravit, doslova 100% posun k použitelnosti. Jedna chyba která to trochu kazí: po úspěšném zaplacení přes Google Pay aplikace nijak nepotvrdí platbu. Vrátí se na obrazovku s přehledem prázdné objednávky. Poté přijde SMS, že se objednávku podařilo vytvořit, ale v aplikaci se to nijak nezobrazuje dokud ji nerestartuji. | Got improved a lot latelly. All things I need are working. I used to prefer web application, now I use this. Is there a way to change language directly in the app? | Easy and straightforward to use. Great selection of Czech and Non Czech Foods, including British Marks and Spencers. Super range of vegetarian and vegan substitute foods. Able to add notes for the order or for the delivery driver. Open the app to check on delivery status. Same day delivery. | Works well, intuitive design, fast. | Very buggy (leading to 30mins to finalise the purchase:was not responding), only one localisation, after yesterday update doesn't start. Very frustrating | Praktická aplikace s jednoduchým objednáním skoro jako na webu, jenom najít kategorii receptů je trošku složitější. | Funguje. | Apka se občas nenacte, není vidět podobné výrobky jako u Košíku, kódy slev se nedají zadat v appce | Buggy unreliable slow app | functional | thank you for the great service | quick and easy | easy.relevant.economical | Low loading, bugging app | 4 protože je stále dost co je třeba v App zlepšit ale služby rohlíku mohu vřele doporučit | Easy to use interface. Has many issues in various situations, when the app just gets stuck or doesn't show any results. It is a little bit better than the mobile version of the website in this regard, but still not great. | So far so ... excellent. Both the app and the service seem great! | Mnohem rychlejsi nacteni produktu nez na webu. Usporadani je malicko jine, coz vyzaduje chvili zvyku, ale je uzpusobeno pro mobily. Takze super. | supr sluzba, uchazejici ceny ( za usetreny cas to stoji), mili ridici a proste vseobecna spokojenost. Jen jedna malickost - chybi persistentni razeni. pri kazde zmene kategorie se to prehodi na doporucene. | Fajne | Not in English | Většinou to moc pěkně funguje. :-) | works better for me than the website. less laggy | Místy se objevují chyby s přidáním zboží, ale jinak spokojenost. | Chyba funkcionalita ktora je na webe, co je skoda (filtrovanie cez alergeny a pod super veci), aplikacia je casto zabugovana co znemoznuje pouzivanie a clovek sa musi vratit na web, jedina uzitocna funckia pre mna je sledovanie casu prichodu kuriera s nakupom. | I enjoy the app, seems what ever I need is there. | Někdy se seká/padá | using it weekly for the past 3+ years. amazing service, easy to use and if there is ever a problem woth some product, you get money back immediately | Aplikace funguje dobře a Rohlík na ni pořád pracuje a zdá se že poslouchají i připomínky. V aplikaci se da jednoduše objednat i případně reklamovat zboží z objednávky pokud je nějaký problém. v součastnosti nemám nic na vytknutí :) | Spamuje telefon, neustále se připomíná. Nepodporuje landscape mode, nepoužitelná z tabletu, škoda. | Why no English version?? | Mival jsem sluzbu rad, ale kdyz praskly ty vykoristovatelske praktiky stran kuryru, jsem Rohlikem zhnusen. | Viz článok na a2larm | Na android 12 nefunguje u mě skoro nic. Nedá se vyhledávat výrobek, vždy napíše, že nic nebylo nalezeno. Kategorie se nikdy nenačtou, adresu si nepamatuje, takže objednávám a vkládám do košíku z webu, v aplikaci jen dokončím objednávku. Nechápu, už byly minimálně 2aktualizace za dobu, kdy mám 12,ale pořád nefunguje. Odinstalaci i smazání dat jsem zkoušela, nepomohlo. .. | Chtěl jsem se podívat co mají, ale to se nedá bez registrace, tak smazané | Skvělá aplikace, přehledná, jen bych ještě ocení možnost dát kurýrovi dýško zpětně po dovezení nákupu | Can't finish my order. I can't see all the time spots like in webapp either. This app is trash 🗑️ | English man! | Po poslední aktualizaci je aplikace takřka nepoužitelná. Obsah košíku se nerefreshuje, tlačítko pro dokončení objednávky disablované. Celkově je aplikace velmi zasekaná, requesty trvají nepřiměřeně dlouho, aplikace není uzivatelsky přívětivá... Web běží bez problémů. | I saw in march 2020 that rohlik team promised that english will be implemented soon. We are nov 2021.... What can I say? Just to uninstall the app and use web ...😕 | Uz to není ta hrozná předchozí aplikace. | How can I use this app. in english? | Jejda něco se pokazilo zkuste to prosím později, nepoužitelné | Its all in Czech. Web version has English why the app don't? | English version please. | English language please! | Nedá sa nakupovať = useless. | The website is better | Appka je občs k nasrání, ceny jiné než na desktopu, půl hodiny než se syncnou s desktop verzí a pak v košíku najednou mi vyskočí, že vše už není ve slevě. Po kliknutí na nechat v košíku je bez reakce a můžu si klikat třeba do konce života. | Na desktopu mnohem lepší, tady furt nějaké malé bugy. Třeba při kliknutí na přidat do košíku se občas zase samo preklikne zpátky, jako kdyby se zboží hned z košíku zase odebralo. Taky občas nezobrazí žádné položky a musím prekliknout do jiného pohledu a zpátky, abych udělal refresh. Jako jedna z mála aplikaci se mi na mobilu seká při scrollovani. | Poslední dobou je appka k ničemu. Nedovolí mi to jít k objednávce a vždy skončí s chybou. Ukazuje neexistující volná okna na objednávku, která už nejsou podle webu volná. Dost často mi to ukazuje zboží, které už není skladem, jen ho nejde přidat do košíku. Aktualizuje data dlouhé minuty. A v kategoriích nelze nijak filtrovat. | Please please offer English, otherwise it's great. Thanks | The app gets stuck loading the pictures, by the time I finished my shopping some of the products were no longer available. Then the payment gateway got stuck and my chosen time of delivery was no longer available. Waste of time | An English version would be great. | V aplikaci se stále nedá efektivně filtrovat. A načítání aktuálních dat trvá i na rychlém připojení někdy i desítky sekund. Stále je tak lepší používat web než aplikaci. Škoda, protože po stránce vzhledu je aplikace zvládnutá skvěle. | English review below. Program je průměrný. Má to mnoho nedostatků. První je ten, že do teď nemůžu platit zapamatovanou kartou. Něco se mu nelíbí a basta, žádná konkrétní chybová hláška. Tu kartu musím zadávat znovu při každém nákupu! Velice se mi nelíbí, že program mi leze sám do kalendáře a zapisuje čas doručení bez mého svolení! EN: App's got a lot of flaws. Doesn't remember my card details and gives me vague error messages every time. Makes notes in Google calendar without my permission!! | Nakupuji zde přes rok, super výběr a přístup k zákazníkům, ale teď jsem objevil košík a ceny jsou za stejné zboží oproti košíku o dost vyšší, průměrně vyjde můj běžný nákup 1.5x dráž což je docela dost. | Opakovany samovolny crash aplikace behem nakupu. Pri poslednim crashi dokonce aplikace ztratila nejenom ma predtim ulozena data (adresa, telefon...), ale i nakup ktery jsem behem cele obedni prestavky daval dokupy. Ztrata casu, ktereho i tak nemam nazbyt. Odinstaloval jsem a neplanuji uz v budoucnu pouzivat. | I like very much the service Rohlik provides and the premium products they offer. The app is very good, but doesn't support English. Similar apps do supprt English (e.g. Tesco's) and funny enough so does Rohlik's website. Would rate it 5 stars if they add English. | Nákup som v appke zaplatil, peniaze mi v banke zablokovali, appka mi nákup potvrdila, ale nákup neprišiel. Po sťažnosti som sa dozvedel že oni moju (už zaplatenú) objednávku neevidujú a že ja som na vine, že som ""rýchlo klikal"". Presviedčali ma, že objednávku nemajú. Na otázku, prečo mi potom na karte zablokovali presnú sumu za nákup, keď o tom nevedia, som nedostal odpoveď. Musel som si objednať ešte raz a tentoraz zaplatiť aj dopravu (ktorú mi refundovali ako kredit). Plus to vyšlo drahšie... | Great app, not in English. | V poslední době výpadky. | Skoro vždy aj pri vynikajúcom pripojení, keď chcem nakupovať cez appku, ""sťahujeme čerstvá dáta"" trvá aj niekoľko minút. Je to hrozne otravné, lebo sa pri tom mení ponuka, hlavne v zachráň jedlo sekcii. Úplne to demotivuje používať aplikácií a keď je počítač ďaleko, je to dosť otravné | No English! | Nepoužitelná aplikace i po přeinstalaci zobrazuje pořád ""Stahování nových dat"" a neumožňuje nic vložit do košíku. | Nejde se přihlásit přes Facebook. Při každém pokusu o přihlášení se zobrazí zpráva, že aplikace nemá přístup k emailu. V nastavení facbook aplikací však přístup má a navíc se nezobrazí ani možnost přihlášení. | Still not translated to English. Very simple feature to develop. WTH 🤷‍♂️ | Nova aplikace je neprehledna. | Nefunguje přihlášení | S aplikací jsem byla velmi spokojená. Po nedávném redesignu ovšem musím konstatovat, že změna je k horšímu. Ikony jsou větší, čili je třeba víc skrolovat. Víc mi ovšem vadí haprující funkce vyhledávání, napíšu ""máslo"", najde mi máslo, bez diakritiky najde kromě másla i maso. Maso již nenabízí kategorii ""farmářské"", čili se musím proklikat celou nabídkou masa a všímat si ikonek u každé položky. Možnost napsat zpětnou vazbu po odeslání objednávky nefunguje vůbec. | The only food e-shop that adapted to huge demand spike due to coronavirus. The only modern food e-shop in Czech Republic I know of. | Nefunguje. Je úplně jedno, zda se snažím přihlásit přes e-mail, nebo Facebook, přes mobilní data, nebo Wi-Fi. Ještě nikdy se mi nepodařilo do té aplikace přihlásit. Pochopitelně mám aktuální jak verzi aplikace, tak Android 10, tak i ostatní aplikace, omezený běh na pozadí ostatních aplikací a procesů, tak i normální telefon (Samsung Galaxy S10 5G). Odinstalace , nic jiného. | Nový redesign je nádherný. Radost používat <3 | Přehledný, dobrý výběr, akce a možnost přiobjednat zboží - velmi užitečný e-shop. | Love the app and the website, however would be nice to have an English version of both (not a google translator version). Keep up the good work and thank you for the support during these quarantine times | Super obchod a aplikace. Neslo by k produktum pridat moznost komentaru nebo feedbacku? Lepe by se ukazalo, ktere produkty jsou kvalitni a ktere mene. Prosim bylo by mozne spravne aktualizovat zemi puvodu podle disponibilniho zbozi? Je to dulezity parametr, podle ktereho nakupuji. Hrozny neznamo zda z Italie, Chile nebo Indie me prekvapily. | Please add English!! Impossible to log in, terrible. | Nedaří se mi přihlásit a na webu to jde | Nepodařilo se připojit k serveru - využiji konkurenci, děkuji. | Last update broke it. It would be nice if the app would tell that it is intentionally offline. | Ted jsem to stahla a vubec to nefunguje.. | Přestala fungovat apka | Rohlík mám rád, ale nefunguje mi dobře vyhledávání. Napsal jsem např. ""Červená"" a appka nevyhledala ani papriku, ani cibuli. Musel jsem hledat ručně. | Vse by bylo super, ale.... obcas se ztraceji z kosiku predpripravene veci a odmazani tzv. oblibenych polozek ve vetsim poctu je tragicke. | Awesome app, could use English though | User friendly, intuitive and fast. Like it a lot. Just noticed one small thing--it was suggesting my favorite things to buy in the last step but when I added them they weren't available or were sold out. Thank you for a great app and making my life so much easier🙌 | Neustale me nuti vyplnovat udaje ke karte. Pokud necham zatrzene tlacitko Zaplatit zapamatovanou kartou, oznami mi aplikace chybu pri pokusu o provedeni platby. Jakmile tlacitko odskrtnu a pokusim se platbu provest znovu, objevi se obrazovka, ktera uz chce jen zadani CV2 kodu, po nemz platba uspesne projde. | Not bad, but not great either. It's buggy (unable to sign in through Facebook sometimes, telling me the courier will check my age when I click on Pay button, non working search at times...). Design could be nicer too. Košík app is way better. | 👍 | super | Nakupování přes aplikaci je pohodlnější a rychlejší než přes počítač. Doporučuji | Chybí mi v košíku a následně před dokončením objednávky řazení produktů dle kategorie | I've been using the app for about 3 month. The app has been improved over the time. It is quick and responsive, searching is fast. Everything works. | Apka je super, ale neustále žebrání o ohodnocení aplikace i když jsem ji již jednou hodnotil si vysloužilo tuto krásnou jednu hvězdičku. :) Zde tedy je, doufám že žebrání přestane. | Skvělé, úžasné nemám slov. | Nadále nejlepší v ČR, jen zmizel ""popis produktu"". | No progress bar visible during search and when adding products. App seems like it's laging, no matter on speed of data access (it behaves same on the wi-fi or 4G). I prefer shopping on the desktop website than on the mobile app. | Oproti webu hrozný. Použitelný, ale hrozný. | Opakované problémy s dodávkou, mizerná komunikace, skrývání problémů do poslední chvíle. Nemůžete se spolehnout na žádnou objednávku, v lepším případě přijde aspoň o hodinu po termínu, nebo vůbec. Nikam se nedovoláte, nikdo nic neřekne. | Jednoduche, rychle, funkční! | Quick and easy. | Perfect 👌 | No option to return back to the category after you check details of an article. Kind regards, Olga | Very practical, clean interface. Wish it was available in English but between my broken Czech and the fact EVERYTHING has pictures , its very doable. Also Rohlik chef is the greatest thing ever, love the dishes, love the fact every ingredient is listed right there. Makes picking dishes to cook a breeze! | Aplikace stale vyzyva k hodnoceni aplikace po kazdem nakupu. Nyni 1/12 spatne graficke rozhrani na samsung s7 galaxy, nejsou videt tlacitka ve spodni liste. | Přehledná aplikace, vse v pořádku | Much improved over earlier version. | Aplikace je přehledná a praktická pro rychlý nákup. | Working very well. The payment is exceptionally easy and comfortable. | Původně jsem dal 5 hvězdiček, ale už mi leze na nervy, že se po každém nákupu ptají jestli je chci ohodnotit a musím odklikavat debilni možnost Možná později. | Vyrazne vylepsena. Super. Ale furt po me chce, abych ji hodnotil, kdyz koukam, ze uz je hodnocena, tak dam treba hvezdicku dolu :P | Funguje výborně, dělá přesně to, co má - samozřejmě mírně méně přehledné než web, ale to je cena za malý displej. | Přehledná a snadno použitelná aplikace. | Funguje tak jak má! | Vyprodaný produkt občas v jiné kategorii vypadá jako dostupný a do košíku lze přidat. Občas dlouhé načítání při startu aplikace a při potvrzení objednávky. Než stihnu přidat do košíku vše co potřebuji vždy se něco vyprodá a musím vybírat alternativu. | Easy to use and updated live with the availability of products. Brilliant! | Aplikace je super - přehledná, příjemně se používá, jednoduchý design, nejsou v ní chyby (aspoň je nepozoruji). A hlavně samotný Rohlík je boží! Nabídka je dostatečná, kvalita super, rychlost a komunikace jsou vyloženě luxus. Moc velká spokojenost 😌 Děláte to super, díky, že už nemusím do obchodu! | Vyborna sluzba aplikace funguje dobre. | Very good, would be nice to have english version","{""1"":609,""2"":129,""3"":239,""4"":1958,""5"":30371}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Rohlik skillz s.r.o.","Rohlik+skillz+s.r.o.","aplikace@rohlik.cz","https://www.rohlik.cz/",,"https://www.rohlik.cz/stranka/zasady-zpracovani-osobnich-udaju","Rohlik+skillz+s.r.o.","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/C3ATF9CHsuNoS_taIYh0INGB5bgyF7H7LJWTkMftaQCjKpNfh_KLLy7iyvDAMv9JHU72","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/k6wkVdDwHsh50RZODu9dDcnMyQKIteCDMvf5d8r8mH_89UTJRQX16QvSpH58-pUuU-17","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8aIrTxU5DgD5t9Dvt0RW8KZA-Mhc367kECubczVdOXFMOtoBRHt9wtBgWBpoERCyn9o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Cq8Pb33vRnyeBsGw_-OJNyVfd_F5cOHdo3lSQnWotBFYhsPoxF844ZEOJ-kawmg5nyCD"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MKD7Z-kLRrHq6maw4Qr9Z-NA5kokhWQcBjSjhwhZkBeOQigdhL891gNhiNXGjzr3Vlwv"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MovPt-HQ80WlJcdwPvDvvee2CEQGQXEOEF43d9hUK8drTedBiHb0DYCze1bIRdPXQdc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6bIen4Gh7olnzCYPyHr8e4blJBu4mAoTcA8usRZYlM-IzQIrUJrqzGC7i-xjq1pUOFg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aj6a53nKQHLyDixfuRjHOzuYBqeIYTNFYhUkvhx0C5afI3NAHW9CNkhV2fcL_frcVzvE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LMTi_84-nwsWyITXVNcy4hP6VmCmxZgeX67ep_D5PHPOCSka5eLgeJ0b82CL7h2njA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bTzGt1BkPl-G2TdyY0mGZG1G3aXJiMnN2MPvHm6ooYJMMWPRhsLQYX-bX5mVE990bIw""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Mar 27, 2015",1710969617000,"5.21.2","Newly you can easily find answers to the most frequently asked questions in your profile.<br>We fixed a few bugs and added some technical improvements to make shopping with us even better.","[""My favourite app for buying groceries and toiletries in Czechia.

Pak z toho jsou zbytečně situace nepříjemné pro všechny, kdy si každá strana pultu myslí, že problém stojí přímo naproti němu. Já vím, že jsem v aplikaci zvolil jídlo s sebou, obsluha vidí ""At restaurant""... Tohle by chtělo opravit. | Notifikace každý druhy den, co si dám k obedu a teď jsem si chtěl v restauraci i.p.pavlova skrze aplikaci objednat a nabízí mi to nejdřívější mozsnot vyzvednutí za 30 minut. Tak to je fakt haluz | Very disappointed, pop-up adds constantly spam you. Inconsistent setting of delivery time for your order (got an order canceled because I didn't pick it up in time, even though I set different delivery time inside the app) | proč 5x za objednávku vyskakuje okno s vynucovanim notifikaci?? | nadblbejsi kupony. Moc moc spatny kfc | Cold french fries | Inhuman experience | Idk why I often have demonstrations in my area... let me check... oh there are none. So how the hell does KFC think there are any. Other than that, it works well. | Aplikace neustále vyžaduje zapnutí notifikaci i když jsem aplikaci netifikace dávno povolil. Neskutečně otravné 5x odklikávat popup pokaždé když si chci něco objednat | Terrible user experience.. required to select restaurant for menu and login doesnt work 50% of the time... | Aplikace pořád otravuje, že chce posílat notifikace. Ne, nedám vám práva mě spamovat na telefonu, já chci jen nakoupit rychle a pohodlně. To nejde, když 3x během nakupu zavírám hlášku s notifikacemi. | It isn't the only app nowadays that may logout you and you.. don't remember of cause your password. | velmi mi to chutná 5/5 perfektní | stupid app constantly logs out me and block my account | ! Cb .f | Tato aplikace je totální průšvih - nedokáže mi nabídnout objednávku dřív, než za hodinu (u okénka čekám reálně minuty), a ani tu nedokáže provést, protože nonstop pobočka je prý zavřená. Opakovaně jsem se rozčílil, appku mažu, vaše pokusy fungovat na úrovni 21. století selhaly. | It keeps asking about notifications and wants to use your location all the time. The app just tries its best to be annoying and you have to make additional effort to avoid this stuff. | works ok, howevere it keeps logging me out after update | Ok for deliveries, but for pick-up useless. Would need to wait for an hour for my order. | дрочибельно | the application is not showing my exact address, so it needs to be more precise. | I've been trying to register but it's not working at all. Resetting my password or creating a new account, both are not working. Very frustrating... | Fail... No, i do not want to allow notifications, stop asking every 60s. Uninstalled. | Příšerná zkušenost-KFC zrušilo on-line objednávku a doporučilo objednat druhou-identickou, s tím, že se sice musí zaplatit obě ale dojde k vrácení penez. To se nikdy nestalo,ani po desítkách telefonátech s call centrem. Vždy ty samé lži o zavolání zpátky a vyřešení. Nikdy se již nikdo neozval. V současnosti probíhá příprava žaloby - trestního oznámení z důvodu podezření z neoprávněného obohacení a podezření z trestného činu podvodu. Dále byl podán podnět na obchodní inspekci. Nedoporučuji! 0/10 | the delivery discount coupons are always not available eventough the original vebsite is advertising cupons :( | I am sorry, but no veg or vegetarian food. Apologies! 🙏🏼🪷❤️🌌 | Stupid app to find the address, and says come and pick up at the store, if I could I would come, that's why I installed this stupid app. | Kupony nefunguji, ani pri rucnim zadani na kiosku | Buggy, doesn't even have a checkbox to accept terms of coupons... | Each time I read in the news a restaurant complaining that a delivery service takes their money for nothing, I remember AmRest that delays orders on 30 minutes on average, misplaces the orders completely and has the worst customer support that doesn't solve your problems and literally steals your money for nothing. Czech KFC, PizzaHut and BurgerKing apps are a literal scam and I don't know how they are still allowed here. | Vybral možnost S sebou. Nejen, že mi to dali tam, ale na celkem 12 stripsů mi dali jeden B-smat boxík, nechali mě si to zabalit a když jsem chtěl tašku, tak mi za ni naúčtovali 5 korun 😭😭 | App will Not work. KFC app sucks. | Při zvolení objednávky ""to go"" je objednávka vždy nachystaná k odběru v restauraci na tácku a ne zabalená. Štve to obsluhu i zákazníka.. | Po aktualizaci nefunguje rozlišení tady a sebou. Způsobuje to nepříjemnosti pro obsluhu i zákazníky. Nechápu jaký je problém přidat funkcionalitu pro započtení ceny tašky, když uz ji tedy uctujete. | Bohužel dovolí objednat do zavřené restaurace | Worst food ordering app I have ever used! | Podle manuálu od T-Mobile nejde aktivovat pouze nabídku 15 strips za 200. Je potřeba zadat jinou položku a uplatnit kód. A podle T-Mobile stačí pak onu položku odebrat. Ale pakliže odeberu položku košík se smaže celý. Možná by bylo jednodušší uplatnit kód u kasy. Ale to bohužel možné není. | Tohle zas musela vyvíjet nějaká super guma. | To many turns and curves! Makes it hard to navigate and order. They want more info than they need! | Not user friendly and worse coupons ever | The app is quite clean and nice, unfortunately so clean that you can't turn off the notifications about news and deals, which is really annoying and it's the reason why I gave only 2* (turning off notificatios for this app in phone settings isn't an option, because then you cannot see the order notification) | Coupons never chance, same things for months. | Objednali jsme jídlo, které bylo doručeno po 3 hodině v noci, podpora nebyla dostupná, chladné, nepoužitelné kousky kuřete, za to už měsíc nemám vrácené peníze ... | prehledna aktualizace | The app is very easy to navigate through and it looks very stylish, the food is more often than not on time and and is cooked perfectly so 5 stars from me, very satisfied | the worst app on play store, anything dont work properly | Po novom kupóny, jediná vec kolu ktorej si niekto tento odpad inštaluje, vyžaduje aby ste im dali mail a mohli vás spamovať. | I didn't get my 3 free wings but ima get my sandwich | I want coupon to use in the store not book my food from the app | mekac je lepsi ngl | Nepreskocitelne reklamy, radši objednám přes Wolt kde to je přehlednější a podstatě levnější, tohle se KFC fakt nepovedlo | Хорошая | We got food 45min later than pre-ordered time from app. Restaurant somehow not registered our order. We got meal as the last one | Během objednávky jsem zadal, že chci vyzvednout jídlo až za dvacet minut, neboť jsem byl na cestě. Po zaplacení mi ale aplikace ukázala, že jsem objednal na okamžité vyzvednutí.. jídlo jsem si tedy logicky nestihl vyzvednout a v aplikaci jsem mohl stornovat objednávku jen přes volání. | I love fried chicken | Ok | Does not know my address. | Otevřu aplikaci, zobrazím si kupóny a obsluha řekne, že nejsou aktivní. edit: opraveno | Bydlím 15 minut od kfc (Roztoky u Prahy) ale dovoz není možný naopak mě to popuzuje at jedu do Prahy i přes zákaz.. | There is no option to remove saved credit card. | Ordering can't be more chaotic. | Mel jsem 15 minut na jidlo ve meste. KFC jakoze zavreny, ale pred nim fronta kuryru. Ze pry jde objednat pickup. Ok. Zkusim. Instalnulnjsem app, natukal objednavku, pak Order and pay... A vyfakovalo mne to, ze to chce telefon a email. Ok, telefon jsem zadal, hnedka prisel nejakej kod, ale nebylo kam ho zadat. Pry jsem pak mel pockat na overujici email (omg, proc chcete na jednorazovou objednavku email, kdyz uznjste mne overili pres phone?), ale ten proste v tech 15 minutach neprisel, takze fail | Idiotic order and pickup implementation. Order will switch to ""has been picked up"" status, hiding the number at pikup time, even when I did not take it yet. Keep showing the number or handle this status correctly. | Zmatené | Cannot cancel or modify order through app... have to call which is a nuisance with all the background noise it is difficult to hear and convey the proper information | Nice app | Good app | Nice | Works as advertised again. | Useless. Just a same few coupons for many months. | No coupons or deals. Worthless app | Update rozbil aplikaci. Update nejde provést a při pokusu o reinstal instalace skončí chybou. | Not working, top complicated. | Aplikaci psali asi nějací opilí studenti. Vždyť je všechno špatně. A angličtinu překládal asi nějakej negramotnej. | Některé položky hlásí ""Not available in your localization"" což chápu jako, že toto není dostupné pokud je aplikace v angličtině. Tak proč sakra není možné jazyk aplikace změnit?! Aplikace automaticky použila angličtinu, protože mám android v angličtině, ani se nezeptá a ani nedá možnost to změnit. Buď k** zobrazte položky v češtině pokud nejsou dostupné v jiných jazycích nebo dejte možnost změnit jazyk, totálně amatérské. | Neviděl jsem nikdy tolik chyb. Misto fries mate napsané fires a misto potato mate potatoe jako kdyby to psalo dite. Chybi mi menu, rad bych znal nabidku a nemusel zadavat nahodnou adresu kam dovazite, abych vedel vo vsechno mate. | Nejde přepnout ručně jazyk aplikace... Can't change language manually, it forces me to use my system language. Such a basic UX not implemented. | Aplikace nefunguje... App does not work | Everything you need from fast food app. | Still asking for actualisation even tho I did it | Never comes in time even though they lure people claiming that they deliver in 30 minutes. Disgusting application. | Transaction - exception raised. Error. Great job! | Not good kupons | Aplikaci jsem měl jen kvůli kuponum, teď je potřeba se zaregistrovat a povolit marketingové využití tel čísla a emailu aby šel kupón použít, tak aplikace ztrácí smysl. | Doesn't working at all, same as their web page | Aplikace mi neustále říká že jí mám aktualizovat ale v Google Play není žádná aktualizace dostupná. Také ignoruje zásady soukromí, začali mi chodit marketingové zprávy z KFC Polsko. | Great people. However, because you don't get a printed receipt when you use the app, you also don't know the code to use the bathroom (WC). And a language option in the App for English would be nice for the hundreds of thousands of non-Czech speakers in the Czech Republic. | its okay i guess, but now its annoying me with update ur app pop ups while i have the newest version so i dont know why is that fix it its refusing to work as it is supposed to | It changes the time, place and takeaway/in place options all the time by itself. I could swear I entered everything right but still ended up with order at the wrong place and time, wasting money. It resets location and time every time you do something and often when you try to change the time and place back, it cancels what you had in basket originally so it all has to be done again... I just had a bad day and wanted just some junk food and I had to order it three times and waste more money... | Delivery is late almost every time, sometimes mixed up orders, when contacted through the form on their website they don't even respond, I wouldn't recommend this delivery service to anyone | Crashes when entering delivery address. | Crashes when selecting city | Can't add city as home delivery. Always turn back to home page of my mobile | Crash when trying to ender delivery address | Doesn't inform about interaction of the discounts, my order's price increased when discount applied. The final price was not shown only after I paid it. | Po zadání města aplikace zamrzne a spadne | Useless, can not add delivery address. App keeps freezing or terminating. | Very bad app. Instantly crashes. | Nemuzu pridat adresu, allikace pri kliknuti na ""mesto"" spadne, ulice,.cislo a popis vyplnit jdou. Telefon restartovan, aplikaci smazana cache/data, i preinstalovana. Nic nepomohlo. | Unstable | Cant type in city name, always freezes | Nemůžu napsat doručovací adresu, aplikace spadne | Doopravy skvělá appka 🤣 Nejde ani vyplnit město, při registraci nejde potvrdit email. Hlavně, že se chlubíte, že umíte rozvést přes 2000 zásilek do 30 min. a kde si je jako lidi objednávají? Dame jídlo a Bolt Food? 🤣🤣 | Cannit register address, keeps stopping... | Can't fill the city, app always closes, so I can't add delivery adress. | 😂✌🏻nedovolí mi to dát fotku v uprave profilu✌🏻😂 | Minimální hodnota objednávky? To jako vážně? Kdyby byl rozvoz zdarma tak to pochopím, ale vy si za něj necháte platit půlku ceny jídla, tak kde je @#$! problém? | Finger lickin grub + | Wrong calculation | Actually the issue not in app but in the service of the KFC BRNO CZ, they sent different order and bad really bad quality of the food 🙅 | Nejlepší ❤️ | Keeps crashing while I'm trying to pay my order and pickup! | An excellent app for online ordering and quick home delivery. It also offers discount coupons. | Nice app, works fine with no flaws yet (coupons are great too) | I can t change +420 to nothing else so I can t register. | Skoro žádné slevové akce, aplikace je tim padem totalne k ničemu. | App works well | Nedá se zaplatit kartou. Ani přes Google pay. Aplikace totálně zbytečná | ... Zaplatla som omacky... Nedostala som omacky :) | Like the offers in the app. | V aplikaci - vaše objednávka byla předána, ale čekám dalších 5 minut... | Appka si neumi spravne zapamatovat adresu. Z DB se nejspis brala stara hlavni adresa i kdyz jsem ji pres UI vymazal a nahradil novou. Diky tomu jsem mel dve spatne obednavky do jineho mesta, z toho jedna placena kartou... A support nebyl schopen zadat stornovani platby. | After completing the orded, i keep getting ""Something went wrong"" error. | Super Aplikace! Slevy atd. Taky fajn | This app works only in Czech Republic! And it works fine! | Perfekšn | Vše už funguje jak má. Díky 😍 | Your sales coupons are joke. Who tf would order coffee and burger? Literally noone is mixing coffee with burger | Absolutně nefunkční, chybové hlášky v polštině, po odhlášení se není možné přihlásit. | Superb | Super apka | I love KFC in Czech republic. Realy great coupons. Works on my phone on girlfriend phone and on sister phone. | Excellent | lies about delivery time. Says 30 mins, delivers in +1 hour | Dobrý den, v seznamu pro rozvoz chybí restaurace Benešov. | Very useful app for ordering food and getting coupons in any restaurant! Would recommend! | Great discount coupons | I tried to pay using saved card, using new card and using KB bank transfer. all failed, nevertheless, there were 3 orders in the app scheduled... | I love KFC❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Works perfectly fine, nice coupons.

Když se snažím registrovat píše, že email existuje. Obnova hesla ale píše, že se email nepodařilo obnovit | Aplikace sama o sobě je dobrá, ale největší negativum je informace ""aplikaci jsme vylepšili, pro její správné fungování je nutné se odhlásit a opět přihlásit."" Když přijdu na prodejnu, potřebuji nakupovat a né hledat přihlašovací údaje (které stejně nevím, mám je doma) tak že aplikaci zase vypnu a přes aplikaci Stocard si musím vzít přístroj ScanGo. Tak že aplikace díky tomuhle kompletně k ničemu. Žádná jiná aplikace po aktualizaci opětovné přihlášení nepotřebuje, tak proč tato? Bylo by fajn tohle opravit, do té doby je aplikace nepoužitelná a proto i jedna hvězda. | Dobrá aplikace, skvělá je možnost využívat scan and go | Hi. The application stop working after the last update. So now when I run the app it closes automatically. I tried reinstall it, restart my phone but nothing helps. | Sponzoruje terorismus | perfect useful | Skenování produktů telefonem je neuvěřitelně svižné. V porovnání s tesco aplikací je tohle úplně jinde. Výtky: Není mi vůbec jasné, jak sdílet nákupní seznam tak, aby ho další člen domácnosti mohl doplnit nebo upravit, přitom by to jít mělo. Sdílením odkazu to nejde. Dtb položek a jejich ceny jsou super, ale abych se podíval na detail musim nejdřív přidat položku na seznam. Globus bonus klub je trochu k ničemu. Málo relevantních kuponů a hlavně na peněžní bonusy musím mít fyz.kartu? Jako vážně? | Funguje, ale obcas ztratí registraci karty a musí se znova zaregistrovat - což samozřejmě zjistíte když zrovna chcete v obchodě nakupovat. | Aplikaci ráda používám, je super, ale štve mě, že mě čas od času úplně odhlásí, což zjistím při jejím spuštění při vstupu do prodejny, a pak se musím pracně přihlašovat (naskenovat kartu, zadat kód). Proč? Také se mi často stává, že nejde přidat zboží - po naskenování kódu visí obrazovka v modu ""Přidávám produkt do košíku"", zasekne se tam, musím se vrátit a znovu skenovat, nebo když si nevšimnu, zboží se nepřidá. | Při skenování zboží mi restartuje telefon. Dřív to fungovalo ok. Mám Pixel 4. | Ok ale nejdou uplatnit kupony. A to že vždy když zapinam aplikaci a jsem v jiném globusu musím změnit prodejnu nenacte si ji to samo neni příjemné. | Aplikace už je lepší, nepadá. Není však přehledná. Jsou zde nesmyslné kupóny na věci, které nekupuji. | Troufnu si říct že je to nejlepsi appka od obchodu v ČR, líbí se mi účtenky, s&g v telefonu, nákupní seznam, informace o vytíženosti atd... | User friendly app for shoping in Globus store. | Really good app - you can see also contents of your goods, great! And some cooking recipes 👌 | Kupóny by se měly uplaťňovat automaticky nebo poloautomaticky (upozornit těsně před placením). Dnes jsem musel celý nákup zrušit a všechno naskenovat znovu, protože protože po stisknutí zaplatit na pokladně už nejde kupon uplatnit ani se vrátit zpět. Pak mně volali, že jim tam visí nezaplacený nákup. | Ok. | 👍👍👍 | The application is good. However today I was told that my card was blocked. How is that possible I don't know, supposedly something regarding GDPR. The application should notify the user if the card is blocked! | Do you have English version? | Aplikace pokaždé vyžaduje přihlášení, což by nebyl problém kdyby prohlášení netrvalo 5 min na 10. pokus Radši otevřu web a appku používat nebudu | Add English and Dark mode support. | App does not work well, need to login every time even when switch between screens. Uninstalled. | Scanování nákupu přímo v aplikaci zní jako skvělý nápad. Dost to ale potom pokazí fakt, že když přijedete k pokladně, dočtete se, že nemůžete z nějakého záhadného důvodu platit stravenkovou kartou a scanovali jste celý vozík zbytečně. Potom stejným způsobem narazíte ještě i vedle u samoobslužné pokladny a musíte jít zboží skládat na pás k obsluze... A když se pak v aplikaci chcete podívat na účtenku, přečtěte si, že se objeví během 24h! Nežijeme ve 21. století? Je tady co dohánět. | Like that I can see my list ofy regular shopping and see the current prices 😊 | Aplikace velice usnadňuje rodinné nákupy, neboť je možné mít ji staženou na více zařízeních, poté může každý člen domácnosti přidávat do nákupního seznamu potřebné zboží. Předností aplikace je získaný přehled o budoucí ceně nákupu. Zároveň s aplikací odpadá potřeba stálého nošení Globus karty, protože kód karty je také přístupný v této úžasné aplikaci. Sečteno podtrženo aplikaci Můj Globus hodnotím nejvyšším počtem hvězdiček. | skenování probíhá rychle, ale pak musíte několik vteřin čekat, až se zobrazí položka v košíku. je nutné tak čekat před naskenováním další položky. | Nedá sa zaregistrovať, nefunkčná appka EDIT: Číslo karty nemám, pretože nie som zaregistrovaný | User Friendly App | Zase o krok napřed. Aplikace je přehledná, funkční a obsahově plně dostačující pro rychlí nákup. Nové aktualizace opět daly aplikaci náskok. Sakra dobrá práce! | Funguje jak má | V nové verzi funguje skenování kódů OK. Spokojenost | Posledni aktualizace velky spatny. Pomaly start shoppingu (pres pul minuty) pomaly pridavani do kosiku, strasne zere baterku. Dokud se to nefixne, tak budu muset asi pouzivat skenner nebo co | Funguje naprosto dokonale. Všechno na jednom místě, jak akční letáky, tak klubové slevy a nákupní seznamy. Dá se použít i jako scan & go čtečka, místo terminálu v prodejně, což je úplně skvělé. | Skvělé! Někdo se aspoň snaží. Lepší než nic. Ale jako zásadní nedostatek mi přijde, že se zboží nedá prohlížet podle kategorií. Proč musím každé zboží vyhledávat zvlášť? Chci přidat konkrétní utěrky, samozřejmě, že neznám jejich přesný nazev, vyhledám ""utěrky"" je jich tam asi 100 a obrázek má tak 20%. Jak je mám najít? To nemluvím o tom, že když si chci zboží objednat a vyzvednout, musím přes web. V appce tato možnost není. Ty dvě hvězdičky jsou za snahu, další funkce jsou skvělé. | Jdu do Globus udělat nákup s aplikací a pak se u poklady dozvím že je tam chyba a musím si to celý znovu u pokladny načíst. | No English version! | Know is more client friendly | Skvělá aplikace. Seznam produktů nabízených obchodem, vlastní nákupní seznam, scan&go servis včetně in-app kódu fyzické karty. Do obchodu stačí přijít pouze s telefonem. Vše funkční. Ocenil bych možnost aktuálního inventáře produktů (dostupnost v daném obchodě) v seznamu produktů s mapkou, kde produkt v obchodě najdu. Současně nerozumím jak si odečtu z nákupu částku z věrnostního programu. | I have to accept spam in order to register | Aplikace fungovala skvěle. Pak ale začala padat vždy ihned při zapnutí. Nainstaloval jsem znovu a stále to samé. Telefon LG V30 9.0 Doufám že to vývojáři opraví protože jinak to byla dobrá aplikace. | Proč musím souhlasit s letáky do schránky při tvorbě online účtu? Navíc souhlas neodpovídá GDPR | Paráda. Použil jsem scan&go ve vánoční špičce. Konečně nemusím začít nákup načtením kódu před vchodem. Byl trochu problém při hledání aplikace v play store. I při zadání ""globus Česko"" byla první zobrazována německá verze. | Scan And go je trochu pomalejší. Cca 2s než se položka přidá na seznam. | Velice dobrá aplikace, je vidět, že do vývoje bylo hodně investováno. Reaguje i na potřeby zákazníka, to je jedině dobře, dnes je běžné napsat aplikaci a dál se o ní nestarat. Pár nedostatků je. Na starších telefonech, je problém s ostřením. Chybí multi language. Ale jinak nic hroznýho. Funguje suprově i na telefonu za 1000kč. | Excelent! :) | Super aplikace, používám ji raději, než skener. Kupóny jsou konečně online a nákupní seznam taky. Jedna hvězdička dolů za chybějící tap to focus. Občas se foťák rozostří a pak už nejde nic naskenovat. Jinak dobrá práce. Přidal bych ještě historii nákupů a možnost exportu. | Funguje, spolehlivá, snad i bezpečná. | Excellent | Ze začátku byla aplikace perfektní. Postupem času ale začala dost blbnout. Občasné nekonečné načítaní Scan&Go a při přidávání položek do košíku, ale to spíš přisuzuji k pomalé veřejné WiFi při rušných hodinách (data lze využít podle nálady aplikace, uvnitř budovy v Ostravě je LTE signál horší). Občasná neschopnost načíst položku do košíku – seknutá kamera, pomáhá jen restart aplikace (jiné aplikace používající fotoaparát jedou bez problémů). Bohužel už této aplikaci nevěřím. | Rychlé a snadné. | aplikace perfektní jen neustálá synchronizace při manipulaci s nákupním seznamem je frustrující. | Super appka | there is no language settings. there are so many people that speak english in your country. try practicing to put english language any of your applications. | Účel plní výborně, UI s UX jsou vesměs taky ok.  K tomu UX mám ale výtku u nákupního seznamu: Jakákoli změna - za/odškrtnutí nebo smazání položky - se zdá být synchronizována separátně, takže po každé akci uživatel čeká a nemůže dále pracovat. Vzhledem k delším prodlevám v komunikaci to není vůbec pohodlné.  Příklad:  Chci obnovit položky z minulého nákupu na další nákup tak, že je jen odškrtnu a ty ostatní nepotřebné smažu. U každé odškrtnuté položky musím čekat na sync, což u jedné či dvou není problém, ale u seznamu s 5+ položkami to začíná být značně otravné.  Co jsem pozoroval synchronizaci změn na dvou zařízeních, tak změny z jednoho zařízení se na druhém projevily jen při pull-down refreshi, ne při těchto dílčích změnách. Z toho to chápu tak, že tyto synchronizace jen posílají lokální změny a nepřijímají nový celkový stav. Proč tedy u nákupního seznamu neprovádět synchronizaci na pozadí anebo hromadně (vytvoří se fronta akcí, která se třeba 2 vteřiny po poslední akci odešle a vyprázdní)? | az na ty nahodne kontroly, ktere vas poslou na konec fronty | Vynikajici. Rychla a zatim i bezchybna. | Za mě super aplikace, funguje rychle a nakupování je díky tomu ještě rychlejší a pohodlnější. Jen malé poznámky - v aplikaci mi nejde zobrazit akční nabídka na další týden, což je škoda vzhledem k tomu, že bych si například rád ve středu večer naplánoval nákup avšak v aplikaci je stále pouze stará nabídka a tak musím plánovat až ve čtvrtek ráno. Dále zobrazená karta na telefonu se těžce načítá do platebního automatu, ale nakonec se povedlo. Takže za mě super 😉 | aplikace běžně ztrácí přihlašovací údaje, nutné se neustále dokola přihlašovat, což považuji za otravné. dále má aplikace velké problémy s vyhledáváním, položky lze najít tak, že začnete psát název, ale nesmíte kliknout na lupu nebo zmáčknout enter na klávesnici, jen vyčkat na seznam položek, pokud kliknete, zobrazí pouze hlášku, že daná položka nebyla nalezena. jinak funguje celkem uspokojivě. v aplikaci by se hodilo možnost odeslat připomínku. | Super aplikace, baví mě jednoduché přidávání produktů do seznamu z akčních letáku, takže na nic v obchodě nezapomenu. Pochvala za nové Scan&Go! Je to naprostá bomba, na mém Samsungu A5 skenuji vše jak divý :) | Super! Aktuálně funguje jak má a rozhodně usnadňuje nákup. Jen tak dál 👍 | Nefunguje ověření po naskenování Globus karty - nelze kliknout na SMS ani email ověření . Appka tedy není funkční , škoda!:) | No, prostředí hezké, jednoduché intuitivní. Do appky se přihlásíte pouhým naskenováním zákaznické karty, to bylo fajn. Bohužel některé kódy jsou tak malé, že jsou nablízko pro foťák rozmazané a na dálku už není schopen rozlišit čáry. Když už appka neumí pracovat s ostřením, tak bych očekával alespoň manuální zadávání kódu. | Vyzkoušel jsem - aplikace jako taková funguje, ale: 1) ani obsluha v informacích netuší k čemu je QR kód na zemi u vchodu, v menu jsem nenašel jak sejmout kód 2) některé komodity (čaj s lesklým  obalem) nejdou sejmout, po nahlášení bych čekal, že obsluha přidá ke zboží vytištěný čitelnější kód 3) pokud zboží nešlo naskenovat, obsluha před pokladnou dost váhala, co s tím, bohužel nejde nijak přidat do seznamu v aplikaci. 4) zboží z letáku, které si přidám do seznamu, není fyzicky na prodejně - to by snad šlo vypsat v aplikaci, ať to zbytečně nehledám. Jinak dobrý počin, i když nákup s klasickou čtečkou je rychlejší a nemusím se bát, že mi telefon někdo vyrazí z ruky.","{""1"":1049,""2"":231,""3"":352,""4"":1857,""5"":8277}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Globus ČR, v.o.s.","Globus+%C4%8CR,+v.o.s.","aplikace@globus.cz","http://mujglobus.cz",,"https://globusbonus.cz","Globus+%C4%8CR,+v.o.s.","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KGl58AGO6fDp0LmoCBd-T3MPxp3v8-v57aGDmjuuiRvUdzOv60UOhaFyyvWnoTd9PWM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vxu733kuAvghE8tvRcYSECp2gFE-bcCzcQF-voJRgFGq_8KiVZKLMkPQ2BBaPnUkxPw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sTju2rfKoZIkvoDB1i5-_vUc5OMJwx79qypLUpX_j1RvNtHiW5z6KTagoWQqfbIug40"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cptYz3lTZEt_fcVeHIJRwFUBQ5UFo_B-zzEBc48vhRfesJoiT2ZnIn6lAsWi1V8MVpk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N9arboxL8tunYImZ91AlQH8s6gTAjfBhv_jAKWhplHpFVeoY68C9YzMdBFMRD10FUw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1ZREPPntTA545Mf1uJppl8WiSQdX2zvzkUax_bqsPIaobN6FUzy9vAfNjCEDZDMI8Q8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IjQ8VIJco1ZhUZkxdJNOo7nfag3rgj1w85pudNIUOcncXFjf6Frhpd638Hk55TZXDTs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3tgJPr6yIDiKxduP1ojgHyahLMOlauxYQUtcNGClVHThxIfUOwlBP9gcQDZzBJUuA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UX2yRjBY4qtoUl02AyxM1EUuRGdBgp9GR5mNjGEEM1NYs0fITPRzghZd8HZQ28eZzA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dYwNOpiH_MLwRzC7bRJ_EXrMkDQ1L0dB9afyu4OdOUeiGoacuBTdeZwY3Z4GjTGcS84""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-RLhyvx9Qs?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vxu733kuAvghE8tvRcYSECp2gFE-bcCzcQF-voJRgFGq_8KiVZKLMkPQ2BBaPnUkxPw",,"PEGI 3",,false,"Nov 13, 2018",1710150055000,"1.9.27","V nové verzi 1.9.27 naleznete: <br>- novou podobu otevíracích hodin v detailu pobočky<br>- mnoho různých úprav pro hladkých chod aplikace","[""Hi.

If you deliver goods and the buyer claims he/she did not receive... The money will be refunded back even if delivered.. So PayPal is no go zone for me. O star could better describe my review | What is ZIp while registering | yabyouuuuo | Good experience with PayPal keep it up guys | Every good and helpful | Try to log into the app...put in my email and password and app closes...rinse and repeat. Won't work | It simpy does the job. I have just had problems once with donating in foreign currency but probably it depended on my settings. | It won't let me download it | Gives me push notifications for payments, which is great. The app itself is a bit slow and buggy, sometimes crashes randomly or gives generic error messages. Edit: previous review about it being broken completely seems to happen only sometimes. | Good | Was super easy to send the money overseas!! | Silently reset my currency convention option to be converting by PayPal so they can steal more money from me, be aware | I m unable to withdraw the money to mpesa account....kenya | Indicate clearly amount that I sign off on | So convenient 😀 | Easy to use and feel better protected as no one gets any of my account information. | Excellent | It's great 👍 | Five stars worthed | So frustrating 👿 | paypals website won't let customers make payments. paypal sends you to a web page that says web page not found. I have a bank card attached to my account. It insists that I add an account. Then sends you to that dead end web page. This has made my account delinquent, even though I keep trying to make a payment. don't bother with their credit card. Another company that finds ways to cheat their customers. | Never any problem with PayPal. | Excellent | PayPal's awesome | Excellent | Scammer's paradise. Never send as friends and family. Now my account is temporarily restricted and they want details from my old card that I replaced. Meanwhile the scammer continues to scam people while not getting banned. Horrible app. | Don't use them, I have used PayPal for years but I'm deleting my account. The app is so bugged, then on top of that if you make any changes it takes 7 DAYS to update your account so if someone sent you money its stuck there for 7 days. You can call support and they will give you security questions to answer but BEWARE if you answer right but they input the answers wrong it will lock your account for another 72 hours!! And all customer service will do is say "" oh well sorry"" | So very convenient ,financially as well as physically! | PayPal doesn't care about any of us. I get treated like a dollar sign when I call to have something fixed. | Haven't had anything I won on it | Very smooth transactions | Site will not recognize my new debit card | 👍 Great | I am sending money and it is supposed to be Friends and Family and I never got a prompt to change it. | Amazing | Like many others on here the app has recently started immediately closing after opening and it is very disappointing to see that this has been going on for months with no fix. The fact there are nonsensical responses to peoples reviews from PayPal that do nothing to suggest that anything is being done to address the issue is equally bad. App is now useless so good job and if you don't care to fix it or communicate with your customers properly then neither do I | This app isn't working on xiaomi.i try to sign up but it's stuck in verification code | Love the app and the security level | Atrocious app and company. Their app won't let you add money to your account in certain countries. When it does they take a huge commission and then hold the money for up to 21 business days so it's unavailable to use for a month. Avoid at all costs! | I have not encountered any problem with this App since started using it | Clean,clear and smooth! | I star and a half It keeps giving me I'm not robot | Awesome | Easy to use | Easy to use | Great | Easy to use | I thought PayPal wil be nice but this routing thing they ask where the hell must we find it if your bank don't have one how does the absa people get in PayPal? | People hacked up all the time | I am satisfied for the fastest way | Easy and fast | extremely bad option and too much complicated app for an option to send money, they charged me money to verify card and still is not verified , i uninstalled it immediately | Cannot link to bank account | Never use anyone else | Does exactly what it says but don't use for large amounts to send to people. The exchange rate is extortionate pro rated. | Easy to use no fuss Still great ! | Fast secure easy | Good for day tow day | Good | These is app is very and easy to operate | At times, even though you jump thru all the security hoops, out in the passcode sent to you BY the Site, they still deny your payment. What's the point of asking me to put in a passcode , if you are just going to refuse to let me complete payment? | Tip top Flip flop | Love PayPal very reliable I pay all my online shopping through PayPal. | Op | Good | So far, so good | So quick and secure couldn't be more pleased | Why is i that i cant open an account,i downloaded it and i have been trying to open my account but they keep saying SORRY WE CANT SEND THE CODE NOW PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER, i need the code to open the account and even when I come back later it wont still work, what a waste of time👿 | We used PayPal 15 years ago and stopped using them when our credit card was hacked, their security is awesome if you're trying to get into your own account but not so good if you're a scammer. Fast forward to last year and I had to use them because of something I was buying online and it was just too hard not to. So we got scammed again, this time through another mob that make it impossible to access you're own account, Apple, or crapple as I call them. PayPal refused to credit the dodgy charge | Hello I am order one product 17 dollars...after cancellation my order next 3 day refund my balance...but why 21.03.2024....after cutting my 17 dollars..immediately I need my balance | Unfortunately it is unavailable from Iran and made it unavailable for us 👎👎 | Satisfied | So far extremely happy. | You guys are great and I hope you continue to operate so amazing. PayPal is priceless, simply the GOAT! | Makes life more confortable ^_^ | Nice | Seamless | The worst money system. You can open an account and add your bank card, but after they block your, because your ID and home address don't accept by they system. But if you provided Ukraine documents, you will be blocked permanently and can't use this. I have contacted with support, sent documents several times, but got answer - sorry, we can't help, our system block you documents | Good experience | High fees, bad conversion rates and long transfer times. I don't even understand why my money was converted with a bad rate when there was an available account for the currency I received... | I need this to download faster okay please | Cannot uodate aop. | Easy to use and very convenient | I find it hard to navigate. Trying to add a password along side the bio. Can't seem to find out how. | Your app has a bug, fix the damn thing…. 🤬 I'm sick of signing in every day, multiple times and trying to fix the issue!!!!! I have ""play a sound"" activated in the notification categories yet every day it turns itself off multiple times so when I get paid I don't hear the notification on my phone… FIX YOUR EFFIN BUGGY APP… Grrrr… 🤬🤬 | Some reason I cannot login into the PayPal mobile app but I can online with the same password and email or phone number and password it's ridiculous I wish it could be fixed | Good | My account was permanently limited for no specific reason with my funds still in there. Do yourself a favor and use an alternative. Alot of people has reported issues with paypal constantly limiting their accounts out of nowhere. | Haps | I'm having so much trouble proving who I am . I'm synced into Google with all my updated info, but I'm having so much trouble getting in. I don't know what else more I can give you. I check in with my finger parents. | I took a big L I need update | I can't link my bank account why ? | Need to learn more about this app | Seems straight forward enough | TLDR; Wouldn't be my #1or2 deff my last choice but works for what I need it too when only option....I like PayPal slightly... It's not my 1st pick with $apps but occasionally it's my only payment option. I don't like how hard it seems to find something on there because there is imo too too much stuff on there. It would be nice if we could add or remove what we want from a list of key things? And WHYYYY can't ever ever find my transfer frm PayPal to Venmo payname I honestly give up 8/10 times. | Nice | no responding in redmi note 12 | I'm a mercirent US5C | Excellent | Bakit hindi ako makakonect sa paypal | Fast and convenient. | I NEED SUPPORT. THE MOST SUSPICIOUS AND FRAUDULENT COMPANY I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED SINCE RECENT YEARS. SOMEONE FROM PAYPAL PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME IMMEDIATELY... YOU HAVE RENDERED YOURSELF UNREACHABLE. I NEED MY CARD REMOVED FROM MY... YOUR WALLET BEFORE YOU STEAL ALL MY HARD EARNED MONEY. I CAN'T USE MY ACCOUNT BUT I CAN'T REMOVE MY OWN BANKING INFORMATION F R A U D. CARD REMOVAL PLEASE! | Vague and unintuative. | Horrible that can not paste in receivers anymore and that printscreen goes black.. | I want to close my account. I can't close my account because of limitations. I can't resolve the issues because the stupid app will not accept any picture I try to upload, so now I'm stuck with an account I don't want with an app I don't want owned by a company I don't want to deal with anymore. Just close my F*×KING ACCOUNT!! | I think Paypal App platform can be trusted. | I use this app once a month and without fail every time it makes it so easy to get into my acount and access my credit cards but God forbid you try anything else like bit coin and acount settings or looking at the credit cards I can already use ruins my day every time and makes everything but hacking my account hard | Good apps | I've been ripped off twice using this app. Hackers use it to steal from people all the time! Don't use it until they fix it! | Customer service is trash. They let a payment go through when I did not authorize the payment. I contacted customer service and after 2 weeks was told I was getting a refund. Never received said refund. Contacted support multiple times asking when I would get refund and they give me some bs answer of claim was accepted but still reviewing claim after I was told my refund would be 1-3 days. Waste of time trying to resolve anything with them. | 22/3/24: Cannot sign in because it is invoking pass key login despite not being requested and when passkey login is invoked the app closes. When it doesn't invoke pass key login, it presents a captcha instead of 2fa. Fix it 6/8/21: Constantly freezing and glitches gesture navigation on my note 10 | it's good | Good app | Guess Zion | USE CASH APP. They make you wait for money that was instantly sent to you, that defeats the purpose of it being instant retards. | Paypal has a great service and makes great apps. Thank you! | They decided to ban me from using their service. It's treatment like this that causes negativity in people's lives. PayPal has no reason to ban my account, and they were totally non transparent about why they decided to do it. I'm left in total confusion, as I've done nothing wrong, and they couldn't even tell me what I apparently did. You don't own your PayPal account, PayPal owns your account. This is a typical example of that sad fact. | Can't login anymore, due to endless captcha: click cars, bicycles, crosswalks, etc. Over and over, Forever! | Always been great 👍 | Tremendous! | Such a great app!! | NOT FREE!! DO Not use pay pal had a transaction for under $300 which was a previous client they deducted their money then locked my account for several days not allowing me access to the money, saying they were reviewing it absolutely terrible service!!! | Recieve my funds quickly. | Overall oroduct is great, but there should absolutely be an option to trust a device when 2fA is enabled. Currently, I scan my fingerprint and then have to wait up to 20s for the 2fA prompt to load. I then have to open my password manager, copy the code and paste it into PayPal. EVERY other banking app only requires your fingerprint on a known device, at least make it an option please! There are multiple threads about this on the PayPal community forum, but there seems to be no action! | Always the go to! | Every time you turn around it keeps asking you for your password and you put your password and you know it and it keeps saying wrong password and every time you put it in again and change it it says wrong password and then it'll tell you wrong email | I've had no major issues with this app and in my opinion is very reliable ✌️ | Awesome app 👌 | Good | Sigma | Paid in 4 didn't work. They charged me the full price. | Not available in Pakistan | A++++++++++ great way to fund one of my many vices | Love this app PayPal makes it so much easy to do online orders | Fair | Login no longer functional. Useless. | Good app | Very user friendly | 100%guarantee | Awesome company awesome experience and easy to use | This app is not secure and not safe, have been hacked twice already!!! avoid this app!!! | Can o buy a.bus tricket. On this app | Quick and convenient but forces me do goods and services for a friend | Communist | it's nice | Very good app. | Awful, after biometrics, PayPal still asks for authenticator | An easy and safe transaction! | Absolutely love PayPal I've used it for years off and on | App crashes when I try to log in. It used to work fine but when I got a new phone it no longer works. | I've used PayPal for almost 4 years now but just last week it randomly blocked one of my accounts I use to make payments and when I contacted support they just said they couldn't do anything. If I can't access my account and do anything than PayPal is useless. I am switching my main payment app to venmo. | Every time I try to do anything on the app it tells me I'm offline. Please fix this so I can get my money. | Thank you | It's B.S. charges both sender and reciever | The security has turned into the most frustrating part of using the app since joining in 1999. Logged in through my phone and went through the picture verification for almost 10 minutes and easily 100 pictures. Got tired of it, closed the app entirely, reopened, and had zero issues with zero verification needed. App didn't have an update needed, Pixel 7 Pro is up to date, and connected to Fiber WiFi. Fix it! | Very convenient. | Easiest way to send euros to Italy! | Works great for sending money | Maractulous Work Easy for me to use | Nice | Perfect app! | Horrible | I recently attempted to revive a dormant account and update it. Got a message saying I am permanently banned and can't use my info to create a new account?! I haven't even been using the account since the early 2,000's!! Thanks. | Although i have not used paypal very often, i'v had major issues with P.P. when i'v been wanting to Update my new phone number to my existing account, i have been directed to do all sorts of stuff which i cannot innerstand what I'm doing, and the simple way to get this sorted would be to SPEAK to a human being who im sure are in the office at any given time, i just cannot get my head around why its so difficult to Update a new mobile number and that is after i have tried following the directions | Great app, using it for my business for client to pay. | Great time. | Very safe | All I can say is that is good | Lame | good | I am so disappointed that I a customer for many years have to be going so many bad times just because paypal is not deciding on processing my withdrawal | I couldn't get it through your head I don't have a E mail. | Easy to use!!! | Not opening | Thank you so much ♥️ | Everything is ok until you need customer service. They absolutely do not understand you or the issue. You'll spen drastic time simply helping them to understand the question. then, get transferred or have something unrelated explained to you. Extremely frustrating. Also, there error was theirs, but I still have to wait 3 days for my refund. I have 2 other money apps, I'll just choose them in the future. | Good job | Easy for this old lady to use! | Great app, so easy to use. | Ok | Easy to use and great protection. | What the heck is this? The security challenge just keeps saying that i am pressing the wrong one, but i am pressing the correct one. And when i tried my phone number, its changing the first number too like this (96), which is incorrect since i have my country number beside it. Fix this bug! | very smooth.. if you're used to using a decimal point when sending, take care and check.. apart from that, excellent! | Cool | Straight forward, easy to use. | The worst money transfer ever. Too inconvenient. Too difficult to transfer money and update account. Still the worst service. They like to hold your money as if it's theirs! Terrible customer support | Cannot open invoices, how can I pay for something when I can't see what I'm paying for??? | its help me | It's great | I don't know why I can't log in to my account it keeps saying security check up and says no Internet when I have service and the Internet I give a one star may when they get it up and running again I'll change my star | Very user friendly and simple to use. | Great! | Why can I just not see my payments under payments???? I have to hunt around for them under various sub menus. I don't want to see contacts under payments..I just want to see all my payments history!!!! Make it more intuitive. | Very functional so far for the use that I give it, haven't found any issues | It won't allow me to add money. | Love PayPal! The app is great! Tells so the details of the money and where it's coming and going from | 💯 | Easy for an old guy to use. | This is the worst app you could possibly ever use.

So there's different shapes that kind of overlay the tops and bottoms of the other words below or beside them. sometimes I can't select every single one of the words because of this overlay of uneven boxes and the way that they're stacked or lay over each other's edges.

Po zadání rezervace eReceptu není později nikde v aplikaci vidět seznam všech takto zadaných rezervací (tedy něco jako „odeslaná pošta“ v emailových systémech). A z toho důvodu ani není vidět stav v jakém se rezervace eReceptu nachází. To dělá největší problém v případě, že není v možnostech lékárny požadovaný lék sehnat (nikde a nijak).

Ale jestli k tomu již došlo se v této aplikaci bohužel nikdy nijak nedozvím. Takže nezbývá, než jim zkusit klasicky telefonovat a až se konečně dovolám, tak se s nimi nějak domluvit. A dále mi tam chybí možnost (kterou již dávno běžně umožňuje většina eShopů) pro případ, kdy na receptu je více, než jedna položka. V tomto případě bych potřeboval mít možnost zadat, jestli požaduji dodání celého receptu naráz nebo po jednotlivých položkách (v případě, kdy dodání jedné z položek bude trvat déle, než u těch ostatních). A nakonec ještě detail (vzhledem k předchozím nedostatkům) – všechny dnešní kvalitní aplikace by měly podporovat i tzv. „tmavý“ režim zobrazení (tedy světlý text na tmavém pozadí), který je dle mého názoru i šetrnější pro oči. | Kdybych mohl, dam nula hvezdicek.

Prosím o opravu... | Absolutely useless outside of CR | je vetsi pravděpodobnost ze vyhraju v loterii nez ze se mi aplikace nacte:D u 10 pokusu se obcas nacte 1x, nebo 2x ale treba vubec. takze jsem odkazana na webovou verzi, coz neni tak velika komplikace, ale cekala bych, ze kdy existuje aplikace, tak alespoň bude funkční a ulehci tim tak sledování, asi ne xd | Asi 98% s toho je premium co znamna ze je to za penize 😔 | Forced ads before live stream which contains another ads....seriously?!?! | I live in UK and would like to watch , when i try to pay for premium the page is just loading for ages and will not let me pay ... what do i do please ? | Mam problemy s platinum premium kdyz so zvolim chci premium tak mi to nacita a nacita a na platbu mi to nepusti zkousel jsem to asi 100 krat nejaka rada? Dekuji | nefunguje,nejde spustit nic.. | Poslední aktualizace už fungují i na Androidu 13. | Don't like | aplikace je docela dobra, akorat me stve ze treba u Ghost adventures chybí díly, dříve když bylo iprima tak tam byli všechny díly a ted tam je u každé série jen jeden nebo dva díly, takze davam jen 2 Hvezdicky | Nádhera! Mnohem přehlednější 🤩 Doporučuji! | Otravny reklamy, ktery se pořád zasekavaji. Celkem by mi nevadili, kdyby fungovali. Měli by to vyřešit pro jednou a pro vždy. | ""Obsah není dostupný ve Vaši lokalite"" Skoro nič nejde prehrať zo Slovenska. | Poslední aktualizace fakt na prd. Nefunguje, nelze spustit, proste nic. | Aplikace funguje s aktivním předplatným OK. Co mě ale štve je, že nefunguje na TV boxu s androidem 9 ani na chromacastu s android tv. Nechápu, proč to takhle omezujete. Pokud by mi aplikace kvůli kompatibilitě nefungovala, tak OK, ale ta šance je hodně malá. | Proč se musím přihlašovat? | Chápem, že reklamy sú v appke nutné a akceptujem ich, ale všetko by sa malo robiť s mierou. Niektoré reklamy na konci zastanú, obraz zamrzne a nejdeš sa z toho dostať. Inokedy sa prehráva 5 reklám a cca 10 sekúnd programu, zase 5 reklám a opäť tých istých 10 sekúnd programu a tak dookola. Už som raz appku odinštalovala a v nádeji, že na nej nejakí vývojári pracujú a vylepšujú 'glitches', som ju nainštalovala zase. Ale mám len jedny nervy. | Půl hodiny jsme strávili tím, že jsme se snažili všemi možnými způsoby přihlásit na TV. K čemu si to platíme? Už z principu za všechno, co Prima v poslední době dělá, se jí snažíme moc nepouštět. | Bez podpory AndroidTV, chyba. | Koki | Beru to zpět, stabilní to vůbec není, pustím si pořad nebo seriál běží v pohodě, pak přijde reklama jo to je normální jenže reklama doběží a pak se to stopne a nejede to a musím to resetovat a pořad si pustit znovu!! A mně to fakt nebaví.. Chtělo by to doladit hlavně tuhle chybu aplikace tedy vůbec stabilní a funkční není, má nějaké chyby furt | Zbytecna apka. Reklamy, reklamy a zase jen reklamy. Nic jineho, normalni TV v tom pustit nesla. Odinstalovano. | Jako jede vše docela dobře, ale třeba reklamy by se mohly přehrávat až po odeslání do Chromecastu. Takto si tam chci něco poslat a musím se podívat na reklamy v mobilu a pak až odeslat do Chromecastu. Nevim ano, jestli funguje autoplay na Chromecast na další epizody. V aplikaci chybí na hlavní obrazovce nějaká nabídka nedodívaného videa nebo další epizody, pokud je to seriál. | Sice není jako apka na android tv, ale naprosto perfektně mi funguje na chromecast posílání, takže za mě skvělé. Hlavně s tím proboha nic v budoucnu nevymýšlejte :D Takové to uděláme skvělý modernější update, kdy polovina funkcí umře :D (Plus oceňuji, že si můžu pořád vybrat, jestli budu platit předplatné nebo čučet na reklamy. Občas koupím předplatné, když toho začnu sledovat víc a už mě ty reklamy nebaví, občas holt reklamy.) | Great 👍 | Byla by super podpora Android TV | nepřehledná aplikace - hledání diskuzního pořadu, který běžel jen před dvěma hodinami, je něco jak lovení králíka z klobouku (pořad najdete jen s trochou štěstí a trpělivosti). Zcela nepochopitelně aplikace nefunguje přes LAN (tv-box). | Předchozí appka byla mnohem srozumitelnějsi. Tohle pořád padá. Znovu se načítá a neustále reklama i když být nemá. | Proc iprima neni dostupna v UK | Jako plus beru to, že aplikace ukazuje kolik reklam se zobrazí. A taky možnost sledování videí na výšku, je to příjemnější. Ale jako minus musím dát dlouhé načítání a nepřehlednost aplikace. Já třeba než jsem se dostal k Modrému Kódu, tak to trvalo deset minut, protože vyhledat mi to odmítlo. To by bylo potřeba doladit, ale jinak dobrý. A asi jenom ještě jedna ráda pro podporu. Zrušte možnost sledovat dříve než v televizi. | Otáčení obrazovky mám vyplé a přesto se obraz v aplikaci každou chvíli otočí a hned zas narovná aniž bych telefon natočil, během tohoto probliknutí vždy obraz zčerná a asi 5 vteřin je slyšet jen zvuk. Nastavte aby natáčení obrazovky fungovalo podle nastavení telefonu, ne zvlášť v aplikaci. Také někdy nereaguje tlačítko přeskočení reklamy a to je velmi otravné! | Aplikace je na prd,kvalita streamu 576p logo iPrimy a ne Primy a to se mi Nelíbí, chce to update | Polibte si elipsy s registraci | Kvuli memu problemu s prehravacem na webu (chybne napsana extenze) jsem nainstaloval tuhle app. Ale ta neni schopna ani vyhledat epizodu podle cisla ci popisu (fulltext) a nema zarigistrovane URL, takze nejde na webu vybrat ""otevrit v"", a tak sem musel prochazet stovky epizod, kdy kliknuti ""Dalsi"" docte jen asi 5. A po spusteni videa a shlednuti 3 reklam jsem zjistil, ze to byla jina serie a musel opet projit cisla od zacatku. Pro zachovani klidne psychiky jsem app radsi odinstaloval. | Kdyby to ty reklamy stale nezablokovavali tak bych dala 5 hvězd.Tohle je už vážně sila 🙄 | Ach ty reklamy Kdyz se zacnou prehravat reklamy tak to potom prestane hrat vubec. Ty to zablokoji a nejde s tim nic delat nez zacit znova dokud se to neopakuje. Nekdy porad nezacne vubec. | Aplikace často padá. Přehrávání se přeruší/pokazí při reklamě. Do pořadů je vloženo příliš mnoho reklamních bloků, a dlouhých, bez možnosti přeskočení po odpočtu. Chápu, že je nutné do pořadů reklamy vložit, ale pokud aplikace pořád padá, někdy kvůli reklamě, někdy sledujete jen reklamy...je to na prd. Ještě jednu důležitou chybu jsem objevil, pořád jsem nechápal, proč aplikace padá, když pohnu telefonem. Zřejmě je to v okamžiku, kdy se má překlopit obraz, tak místo toho aplikace spadne. | Nelze nic prehrat, stale rika, te nejsem pripojena k internetu. | Když funguje tak je dobrý. Ale v poslední době..září 2020.. krachuje. Nedovoli hrat koupené epizody. Instalovala jsem 2x znova. Moc to nepomohlo. Android. Samsung note9. Novy. Žádný jiny problém s podobným app nemám. Chybí na novém app oblíbené pořady. Nebo historie..... aktuální stav říjen 2020... je vidět že chyby byly opraveny. Děkuji :-) | Nejhorsi aplikace a sluzba vubec. Ucte se od jinych. Kdyz mate vycerpany pocet zarizeni, protoze se vam jedna televize porad odhlasuje (a to je chyba sluzby a nikoli aplikace jak prima pise) tak zarizeni ani nemuzete odebrat jelikoz ste vycerpali povoleny pocet zmen? Jako vazne? A za tohle si platim? Nezlobte se ale diky, za takovou s****u platit nebudu. | Aplikaci pouzivam už nejakou dobu, vždy hodně padala, ale zvykl jsem si. Nyní 2 tydny nefungovala a po x updatech, kdyz uz se teda dostanu k prehrani serialu/filmu, musim se minutu divat na reklamy. Asi absolutně nejhorsi aplikace, kterou jsem kdy mel v telefonu. | + vzhled, přehlednost - videa pouštěná na celou obrazovku se při sebemenším pohnutí s mobilem samy otočí do malého režimu a občas to resetne celou appku | Jenom problemy, stara Prima Play jde bez problemu IPrima stale rika no internet na android box na telefonu to ale funguje. | Proc se neda poslat obraz z aplikace primo na televizi, jenom pres Cromcast? | UserFriendly app Like it","{""1"":1089,""2"":310,""3"":277,""4"":467,""5"":1234}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 99.00 - CZK 149.00 if billed through Play","6.0","6.0","VARY","FTV Prima, spol. s r.o.","FTV+Prima,+spol.+s+r.o.","podpora@iprima.cz","https://www.iprima.cz","Vinohradská 3217/167, 100 00 Praha 10 - Vršovice, Česká republika","https://www.iprima.cz/zpracovani-osobnich-udaju","FTV+Prima,+spol.+s+r.o.","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/70HJOnfOw7C21GitCEMdWKrQIaoBoZy9Z0fFq-Fo5G_B0ZnRF3NHXFOVfOYrZUiRxSM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1xJFdbB_FMJeaCCCvLCsGl_5uKV5Oksn_XJilwRkeWy2_lh5mUT9GqbZ8I0FW4Hxiw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QFS9xENfn-qycyxZGKwq7vxVrCOZ8w4cl0au___syhYb5HZNOta55tH9fyHjdT8EpQLP"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8VtH0iLk5taRM2haCYBS4Hg2IQ0H3KPgBFz55n1Dt0Wr_08j-x1-4USR4Dny4_4UPw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WBO4TQo07WMi8fiA_PHACWZJtEES8jPBD_kVPfkrhXckJ2dxhKwB1g2h4kYabySO3Q4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qY7Y0MO0FG6v7A017WKibLvBDZq3qdPKCULudjWLVRwPlwC6PQENjLePhlCTqcC87Npc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9KhIdUYpnNDjS0ncmYj-QOQ2lPIxpzDXc6Gva3VU1fXwGHcVluGWAqqyRUmTkH0216Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yuZc-k9xkkJkEzFDWoevDzLEFkp3laqTW3VCYs3QoPafWuy5zFJL17GEkEmGHN2poSI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Opy-_j9OtteVFsN6wT94aJDfYl-5vpGECB7Y5BQVt0cyY42pSTQFICjzw8YgxcpW4Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L5Ib1OjKU-9-UXfSTVfUHPd0VvT0F5zAmLK9d3HuQ1NuZKsxcPB7rwkmFmy9O7_BD70"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/o26bLArWe-DKSofC86iJiJGOhyJv8JyGL4SENLCRdnl3O3bopEiJ2haEE-3TfOQoY9Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ncTYwL77wRjmG3_ezQe05rycfBJh-DpC054fFn8bDiBQLRYyRdNksc77MTOJJ4En1AE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NofpR7RN3dnyHp2ZqQggB-adZIdF3lpT9WAgQw1PlecYtOYEKcqv-LRzF_T1IYM49I0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3LPNTSVjgY_lIDIqsG-mfZMb8EVTjkLwJ6AiZnmCnTMj3znptOoxMpsY6JWaI3n3-A""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",true,"Mar 23, 2020",1708730070000,"2.10.2","Podívejte se, co je nového ve verzi prima+ 2.10.2:<br><br>Stahování je nyní bez přerušení díky vylepšené funkci obnovení stahování.<br>Spotřeba dat je pod větší kontrolou a respektuje nastavení  používání dat.<br>Přerušení přehrávání při změně orientace zařízení je odstraněno.<br>Jednodušší ovládání ve fullscreen módu.<br>Zlepšená stabilita aplikace.<br>Optimalizovaná funkce přehrávání videí.<br><br>Užijte si vylepšenou verzi naší aplikace!","[""Forced ads before live stream which contains another ads....seriously?!?!"",""I live in UK and would like to watch , when i try to pay for premium the page is just loading for ages and will not let me pay ... what do i do please ?"",""Absolutely useless outside of CR"",""UserFriendly app Like it"",""Po větší aktualizace problémy vymyzely.

Bolt food kindly refund me | I used to like this app, and being a person that is working in the day, i count on it to get my dinner, but lately and on many occasions the delivery service has become so bad and it is actually affecting the quality of the food, right now i ordered over an hour ago , the food is ready since 45 mins and still no courier to pick my order, definitely the food will arrive spoilt and might even make me sick. I will just uninstall it, and I hope no one install it, because he will end up disappointed | Great | Fake discounts and false advertising. Found at least several restaurants where is written ""an offer"" with -30% where in reality the price in the app is over 30% higher than in the place itself. This is unacceptable. | Good | Off the hook ✨️ | They take the money and never deliver . Customer service do not care ,,, very bad app | Kaut kāds bardaks lietotne. Atļauj strādāt restorāniem, kuri nepieņem pasūtījumus un tad cenšas izdomāt iemeslus, kāpēc nepieņēma pasūtījumu, bet tajā pašā laika nekas nemainās restorāna lapā | Neseriozitate!!! | Кусок *****, чтобы заказать бургер верификация по паспорту. Нет уж, спасибо, заказывайте сами. | After google deleting my 1st review, I understand now why most apps have good reviews. Anyway, here's why it's 1 star (and it would be zero stars if it was possible). I had 2 coupons, after using the 1st coupon, Bolt Food removed the 2nd coupon. I just uninstalled the app afterwards lol. Thanks for the 1st cheap meal but I'm not wasting 1 more cent if you are going to behave like that. | This app is so cool | App is decent but there is no way to select a specific tip. Please change that | Hrozná podpora. V prípade problému s objednávkou nie sú schopní vyriešit problém. Bola mi doručená nekompletná objednávka. Podpora mi zdelila, že si to mám vyriešit s reštauráciou. | Very poor service, takes forever to find courriers and even longer to deliver!! | This service has the worst customer service of all. Been a loyal customer since 2015 when they came into the Latvian market as taxify, stayed loyal when yandex was pushing prices down, refused to use wolt when they started food. Today I'm deleting the app because they can't get any anything done right: driver scams you - it's your problem, the courier can't find you - too bad for you, want to delete just one part of their business - too bad cause all of them are gone. Praying for uber to come! | Terrible experience. Will never use it again. Anti customer approach. | Extremely Poor service! They do not follow up on orders! You can wait 3 hrs for a 30 min order. | Very bad I am deleting the App and wil make sure I don't use it ever again | Cheap good food | Not available in Stellenberg Road | This is for the app in Lithuania. Works well enouth. But they are trying to hide their delivery fees in food costs. Kebab costs 6eur in place? It costs 8 via app. But hey, free delivery... | tasty | Terrible customer support, always send AI generated replies and don't even refund you properly. If you want to speak to a human being, you have to go to very far lengths to do so. | I have ordered food from many apps but I have found this Bolt app to be the dirtiest. There is a good thing about it. They give discounts. But sometimes they ask for their ID card and selfie. What does this mean? This is our privacy. ever foody and wolt These two companies never asked about our privacy, it is our choice. Whether we order by cash or online, it does not matter whether we order online only, it is our choice. | The support | Ordered Sushi, and after ine hour of waiting I've got message, cos my order was just cancelled, because Bolt courier, ""accidentally took wrong order, and left restaurant "" no sorry, no apology, nothing from. BOLT SIDE. SIMPLY reorder if you still hungry. Ridiculous!!!!! | Fraudulent practices. Drivers will eat your food but claim they delivered it. | Customer care is non-existent. They have 0 softskills and cate for customers. | GPS in Malta does not work | Awful | Part of the meal was delivered and they didnt do anything because the ingridients were not written on the restraunt menu, like they cant use the internet to search what that dish consist of, awful customer service overall | The worst customer support, they have. And the service is getting pretty worse each day. | Terrible. App has bugs when you try to contact support. Food delivery is extremely delayed. Get glovo instead | Dupa 3 ore de cand am dat o comanda cu maxim 40 min timp de livrare, aceasta a foat anulata fara posibilitatea de a vorbi cu un operator uman. | it has no functionality to: star/favorite places you want to try it has no option to ""block""/remove places from the view it has no option to report vendors (for inflated prices compared to the vendor website) | It literally became a scam. Courrier can do anything, even outright not deliver your order at all, and support will do nothing about it. | It has been over 2 years and still your app does not cover our area. Waist of time | This app is full of unserious set of people selling nonsense do not download!!! Find the restaurant on Google map and order or go there to avoid any inconveniences.thanks | Vis bija labi līdz šodienai. Pārdomāju pasūtījuma saturu. Uzrakstu uz atbalstu. Paradās, ka atcels pasūtījums. O super! Saprotu, ka varu pa jaunu salikt ēdienus. Salieku! Atnāca man divi pasūtījumi. Pilnīgi neur neparadījās, ka ir divi paralēli pasūtījumi. Tikai kad piegādāja, tad sarakstā pasūtījumi paradās šie divi pasūtījumi. Izstradājas savu aplikāciju normālāk. | Low as f payment for courier. 1 tip from client per month like 2-5 zl. | Best ordering app so far | When you need help nobody responds, also they raised the delivery fees a lot and now it's just not worth it anymore unless you order food for 2+ people and split the bill. Better to use Tazz or Glovo or any other app | Very good | App works as expected, just some feature choices are a bit wierd, for example you have to deside if you want to leave a tip when ordering, so if the currier was rude or was making stops along the way with your order, well you already tipped for it :) or the other way around if you got nice service but did not tip in advance, well now you can't. I guess its a saving on processing fees to make us pay with one payment. | Scammers. Stole my money and didn't even receive any food. I never received my money or food. They still got the nerve to tell me they are compensating the kitchen. Scammers. Just wait for it. Cause I'd surely sue you guys. | Used to be pretty alright until they took away the ability to pay with cash. Now that they don't have that edge over Wolt anymore, I'll likely be uninstalling and using Wolt a lot more. Being able to pay in cash was the only reason I was willing to pay slightly overpriced prices on this app. They also keep trying to offer me discounts that I can't use because guess what? I'd want to pay in cash. Good job on making sure your app was no longer unique amongst your competitors. | Rubbish | Worst experience ever, speaking with support is same as speaking to the wall, got damaged order after 1h (food was cold af) at that point it was not eatable, and they offered 4e when i bought out 25e order. Worst part is thar courier was delivering 3 orders at once an my order was the last. Restoran i bought from had increased delivery fee to ensure that curier will deliver it faster amd still i chrcked map and saw that it was taking my food for a drive for 1h when they forced me to pay extra | The app works well for the most part, but it adds significant markups. I found products that are half the price on the manufacturer's website compared to the app. And in the physical store, they are about 2/3 of the price displayed on the app. It seems excessive, a per-order fee would be preferable instead of inflating prices, a rather cunning concept. | The support has gotten worse, agents frequently lie and gaslight even if the order is clearly wrong or severly delayed. | Awful service. And please stop with misleading delivery promos , and hidden service fees. | Service quality is not relevant to the service provider. Better off with alternatives. | Péssima assistência. Pedido muito atrasado, e só 2h depois é que me permitiram cancelar. | After asking them to educate their employees in basic comunication and behavioral skills (some guy ring for no reason on my bell and blew me off with ""no abla"" after i asked if i can help him with something and walked off...) i got WARNED not to use ""THOSE words"" (Implicating that i was racist after saying ""teach them to read last names on the bells, if they know only those *wormy* letters..."") That trigered woke system i guess...would recomend 11/10 if you are a borred lawyer 🙂 | Support dont help you at all. I order burger king at 10:00 at night and i get after a wile a message from my delivery guy telling me go get your food cuz i will not delivery. Now i did not know who the f is this paki. Now support refunded me after 10 hours cuz they do not work at all and that was it no credid no sorry no nothing just a refund and now im waiting for the money to come in. Do not support the useless bolt workers. I hope they shut down soon and fire all of them every last one | high fees, no option to cancel order or change address, suport is slow | Great. Would appreciate to leave a tip after the delivery. | The app is good and the experiance with the customer service is nice. I wish if they can allow me to share order details with other app users in WhatsApp. Like sharing where the riders are with the people I ordered together with. This will be great feature should the driver arrive and I was busy to pick it, then it could be collected by the person I shared riders details and location with. | Idk | Excellent !! | Useless | For the older version | Good service i order food and get in next 15 mins the expected time was likw 25 mins so give 5 star | I ordered food for my kids at 7pm at 9pm food not delivered, what a joke ! What pains me no way to cancel this order ,the kids have gone to sleep. Yam fried 2 hours ago waiting for biker to pick up, hmmm | Alfred bot... | Привезли лише частину замовлення, кошти не повернули | Customer support form is so hidden..... | The comments are very good and I think it's a good app for food and stuff | Awful reliability, Zero customer service. | Very terrible app.Communication is completely messed up. | Please make courier search and food preparing in parallel | Bolt Food Doesn't Deliver In Braamfischer | Useless and complicated | I had an incident and the customer service guy sent 2 copy pasted messages and proceeded to ignore me, the issue was not solved and I had to pay a taxi to get the food mylsef 👍 on a delivery app, truly amazing | Garbage app, its surprising if something ever works | Amazing | Zero customer support | never estimates delivery time properly, always from 20 to 40 more minutes than expected | Neimanoma atsaukti uzsakymo. | Completely useless app doesn't work don't waste your time downloading this app | Not recommended ! If courier don't bring delivery no refund will be returned. And there are couriers that just keep the delivery. So potentially be ready to loose your money with this app | They show me purposely restaurant that is not near me so I pay delivery fees. | You order food from somewhere and IF there is a courier who's willing to bring you the food then you are lucky if not you have to personally go and pick up the food from where you ordered. My food was ready for 20 minutes and then I got fed up waiting and went to get the food myself or else I would have stayed hungry on Valentine's day. If it was someone else they would have rated the restaurant 1 star instead of the service of this app. I even contacted support and nothing what else can I do? | delivery was 2.5 hours late. due shortage of couriers. what a joke of an app. | Terrible delivery, garbage | Scheduled an order, and it got canceled by the system. It also was overdue by some time when it was cancelled. The support did not help in any way. | Poor service | The food arrives cold 90% of the time. Once the currier was going on his own business for 40 mins and when I asked to cancel the delivery, I was told that it's the only time this can be done. Overall nobody considers the warmth of your food, the quality or your overall experience (the readtaurants are doing their best in most of the cases from my experience). Overall service is among the worst ones I've seen in EU | Customer support isnt helpful. I asked why wasnt a restaurant available and the response was answering a question i didnt even ask. | App doesn't work, trying to reach support team is impossible | Very bad client service | food app with a good variety of restaurants and options. | app just says they don't deliver to all of the addresses I choose, even areas that worked before | Edit: 24/10/2023, they're refusing to give me a refund, when I stated I had an allergy and an allergen was in my food. Uninstalling. Edit (12/02/2024) gave them the benefit of the doubt around 1 month ago. Same situation. Tomato allergy ignored today, after ordering multiple times weekly, they say I have a history of restaurants ignoring my notes about tomato allergy so I WAS THE ONE GETTING PUNISHED FOR IT, I'm not getting refunded. I ordered multiple times,just today I had a problem. AVOID APP | Not functioning properly especially the point u have to input ur number and country | Is not good to not have the option to cancel a order from the app. | Un jeg ordinar de companie, comenzi peste comenzi respinse, aplicatie abia functionala si lipsa crasa de asistenta pentru orice. O sa va fac reclama peste tot, sunteti niste infecti. | Your guys take long to deliver food. Very unreliable | No issues | Search doesn't work correctly | Kurjeriai tris kartus iš eilės nesugebėjo sekti ""Pastabų"" skiltyje nurodytų itin svarbių žingsnių. Už kurjerio paslaugas šiandien sumokėjome 5€ ir jis net neperskaitė pastabų skilties, dėl to nukentėjo mano sveikata. Parašius bolt food pagalbai, nebuvo skirta netgi pristatymo (5€) kompensacija, tiesiog gavome kažkokius abstrakčius atsiprašymus. Praeitą kartą kurjeris išvis buvo visiškai girtas, agresyvus, mėtėsi keiksmažodžiais. Kuo toliau, tuo bolt food pagalbai mažiau rūpi. Graudu | Orders take hours to be delivered. Some orders get cancelled due to such delays | Worst delivery....They will eat your order | bad | Poor customer support if anything goes wrong with your order. They just ""apologise"" via an automated message. | I was disaponted from this app last week i order my meal from vecchia napoli sky park and when i receved my food i payed in fool amount of money the courior gave me the food.. when i go on the app again on the app they wrote that i pay only 11€ from 31€ ....20€ balance stupid thing...if commen sens thing if idont have the full amount of money he dident gave me the food? if he loose it why he put belance on my acc No served at all | Apgailetina. Ivede DI i aptarnavima, dabar neimanoma susikalbeti. Never use again. | Please allow to name payments cards | Filthy riders and unprofessional support. Exactly the same as their unreliable and criminal taxi service. | Привезли частично испорченный заказ (залит минералкой), возмещать стоимость порченного отказались Ужасная работа с клиентами, как будто клиент с парой сотен заказов решил внезапно их обмануть. Не рекомендую, полно альтернатив. | Propmt was sent, money was deducted from my mpesa,but the order did not reflect in my app. No refund has been made and it's been more than 24hrs now | Here I am again to complain. The app took my money, the order was never processed, and when I'm trying to open a support request the app loads ad infinitum. This is so laughably bad, Jesus Christ | 👍. | Slow delivery noone working | The support is very bad They don't reply on your chat The application doesn't include any number for support The delivers are thieves | Ordered food for delivery, gave me a delivery time which kept getting pushed back, when I contacted the app they insisted it was a self pick up order even though nothing was selected and restaurant indicated delivery times within this time frame. Was told thank you for your understanding 😆 jokers | Got cold food, late delivery. Delivery guy was walking around the building for 10 minutes while carrying my food in a paper bag. It's winter outside. Bolt support offered 1,50 euro compensation. Like a spit in the face. No thanks, I am going to Wolt. | La support au aproximativ un om, care doarme | I really wish that I could tip the delivery guy after he arrives, because I might tip if he/she was fast and some people really doing a great job | Terrible experience. The order never arrived and the support team said it's my fault and i should have been more carefull. Uninstalled | Kindly make order review option available so we can read before buying..some vendors don't deserve to be on this app | Absolute trash. You are paying for delivery+ you are paying service fee+ Prices are higher than in restaurants+ Small order fee etc. | I don't know why bolt food app is misbehaving...I have been requesting for a code to sign in for the past week...till date no code is given when I put in my number...I guess I have to stop using it | Coold food every order | Just one nitpick: the tipping option should appear AFTER the delivery, not before | The food almost always comes cold, half of the times some food is missing that they dont even refund because I do not have photos of the missing food. The customer cannot contact them | Thanks to Bolt the food prices in restaurants are higher than they would normally be. The pricing and all the small fees look like a scam. 0eur delivery from McDonalds cost me 10eur more than buying from McDonalds directly. | I'm pretty happy with their groceries. Slightly expensive, but they deliver what you buy and quality is fine. | Unreliable stupid time wasting app | I'm surprised how a rider can send your food away after been unable to reach you because you've made payment already . And support won't respond to your complaint. | Pentru București evitați aceasta aplicație. Servicii de livrare execrabile: mancare rece, timpi de livrare ce cresc progresiv. Sesizările sunt inutile. | Postali su užasni, chat za podršku ne radi samo se bot Alfred javlja, 40 minuta se nije dostavljač mogao pronaći. Brišem aplikaciju koristit ću Wolt i Glovo rađe. | Keeps on saying nothing in my area but yet on the other apps I do have restaurants close | Očaj. Korisnička podrška je robot i ne služi ničem. Predstave vrijeme dostave na svakom restoranu i platiš da dostave u to vrijeme i ekipa redovno nema dostavljača pa se mora čekati minimalno sat vremena za dostavu, ali najčešće oko sat i pol do dva sata. Najgora aplikacija za dostavu hrane ikada. Teška sramota | They don't start finding couriers till the food is already done and ready for pick up. The process of finding a courier takes 40+ minutes and you end up with cold food. | Easy to use. A favorite restaurants section would be cool to add. | Worst customer support ever invented in history | Does not take accountability. Delivered a random half of an order and only refunded half the order to our ""Bolt"" balance and not the original payment method. Could have smoothed it over by at least giving some coupons or something. Now half the people are starving for an extra hour. And we supposedly got our money's worth. Bad practices. Avoid and use competitor when possible. | It works but the filtering it trash. It shows a ton of pointless stores not related to food. And I can't get rid of them.. | OTP to register still not received 2nd day | Please don't download this it's eated my money for no reason and did not delivered the food and I stayed hungry because of them and they did not refund my money and did not delivered the order.they are clearly scam don't download this app | UNRELIABLE & THIEFS , Your courier Jeremiah stole my food made me wait for an hour in close direction. You can't trust their app. They don't take money but they waste your time | Just don't pay online with them | Food that inside has hair on the bowl,. Not delivery on time,no response to customer.,.I don't recommend this app as well as these restaurants | I'm facing challenges with my registration","{""1"":24693,""2"":1761,""3"":2017,""4"":7890,""5"":63661}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Bolt Technology","8420210619522248974","Food@bolt.eu","https://food.bolt.eu/",,"https://food.bolt.eu/legal/","8420210619522248974","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0OHWPTcW57KoManaR01LKfQq-5jlIAI-qJFqhXjxh101dhcjDCzfj2svI6ofV8EAPqw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Z0FcCHIHe1w0BOmFPTfNTaTbVIPi3KNJxzA4EYWK6m1I9BbdiKMhHvKlZrVZcCn-Xg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D8BQVaIpSWYAK_yOYKtEUKcOYVZKnEe4pR1hwIseF0RTBXCdXQ5uunLllSZ0HEfHuA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/O0xfW5eCHhwKxsqfsW6mUQ9K8M33xpqkI6BAt7yB2z43JT6IJQbATcNP9SIsuoCcmw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Lw-4pdEdHbw4va1eR8kNQVAc09nx23VoRHDichwH71osAxlQex1SsoW2oNh0ESUVsQc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pf6HfQrXeJNg5NRyUwWSzJr3jXOTRppPFxD-q6_VDxiMIekWCG88aFs6v8HmoZYbvjWo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y7PPWBsPLepCDHEN6TvyBKyzNGrrr5bSsEYfVN4DO7JaPrbmbs5HJRJzGgwijaCbMcc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Wk-NHdV71B32G7g1cHoFF7-YM0K8FENuknAZSsEiNJjgELhtrOuoL0U7adYguB-Fr4U""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Aug 20, 2019",1710758617000,"1.62.0","Bug fixes and improvements","[""It works overall fine for me.

Unfortunately it just happens to often that one is not able to get a delivery due to too high demand - whereas other apps are always available."",""The application is quite OK with a user interface you would expect and might be used to. It works just fine and contrary to some other similar apps doesn't lie about prices and delivery fees. Its search function is very limited and basically useless unless you know the exact name of the venue you are searching for. It has the best-in-class order tracking that actually works. The service itself is the fastest and cheapest at my location (Prague, Czech Rep.) and is very reliable. Overall this is the best food delivery service available in the city ...as long as everything goes as expected. Once something goes wrong you are screwed. There is no support whatsoever. It is even stated in their terms and conditions that they are only an online market and that they only care about your money. No guarantees, no communication. I once tried to complain about my order being delivered incomplete and they never even responded. It seems to be a fire-and-forget autonomous system without any supervision and support. Update: The last time I needed to contact the support, it actually worked and I was instantly refunded 100% of the order price."",""The app is overall okay even though the tracking sometimes is weird. But that's the only reason they get 2 stars and not one. The customer service for bolt food is absolutely horrible. Easily one of the worst i have ever seen.

I got a completely different product from what they show on their app and then they just said, yeah that's how it looks like.

"PlantNet Plant Identification","Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand! Pl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it. 

Pl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads or cacti. Pl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature of course but also those that grow on the sidewalks of our cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!

The more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. Flowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant (or the tree if it is one!) is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.  

At present Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. Don't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.

The new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:
- The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.
- The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).
- The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application. 
- The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.
- The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.
- The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.
- The mapping of your observations.
- Links to many factsheets.

The web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/","Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone.

I walk so much now.😃 | Excellent | Very useful | It's ""habitat"", not ""habit"". | I had to change the review downward.. latest version now says it is not a plant.. maybe an insect. What good does this app do if it no longer provides reliable answers. | Significant | So far so good! Hasta mi mamá la usa para su jardín. | It works. It's free. It doesn't ask for personal information. Signing up is voluntary. Great little app. | What's happened?? Can't access the app even after reinstalling. It's say my IP may have been blocked, but this makes no sense??? Used a lot for about 4 years and now I'm not allowed for absolutely no reason?? What gives?? | I love the simplicity of being able to take a photo to check the plant name. Very useful for gardeners, horticulturist or anyone curious about plants. I also love the fact that it's free. | Nice App. | Accurate Happy | I have said it formerly in my comment that mise any of this apps it will just look as if you lost everythings that very important to you in life . | Never fails..... | Not accurate. | Loved | I love the because it help me alot | Excellent guide to have on phone | Could not identify the first 3 plants...I stopped. Now trying to figure out how to close the account | Stupidly easy and useful | Amazing!!! | Very poor | Highly recommended! | Very accurate so far in using it. 👌🏾 | Awesome! | Really helpful app | Very accurate and easy to use | I love it | Quick and easy way to recognize plants | Fantastic app. Don't have to pay anything! | Nice but needs some more improvement. | sometimes difficult to navigate otherwise excellent | I really like this app. It's really helpfull to me. It's really worth it. I rated 5 stars because I had a great experience with this app. Highly recommended from my side 10/10. | Excellant | Good I love this app | Very hard to use to get care and identification of plants, weeds and help on fertilizer, repotting various plants and lighting. | Does not work only shows error | Amazing | This is the best app. | I love that application ❤️ | A very nice app for an amateur botanist. Helps me a great deal to correctly classify a species which I only vaguely know. What's amazing is also,that you can get to know species which are totally unknow to you, e.g., when you're traveling abroad, far away from your local flora. | Very accurate | More Australian natives being recognised | Good functionality and features, works well with no significant issues. It's very much better than many of the other plant identification apps and is completely free to use. | Great app. Very useful | It's been accurate and helpful the several times I've used it. | Very helpful in identifying plants about which I have no knowledge but sometimes not absolutely definitive. | I've learned so many great things by using this app! Thank you! | This would be a very good app if it allowed choosing language other than 
the OS. To be blunt: For some reason it only gives you plant names in the 
same language as your Android. Duh :-( | Much faith in this apps accuracy | Good overall | Great accuracy and very easy to use! | Love this app so much. | Finds it every time | Excellent app. Identification is spot on. | Best identifying app | Pretty accurate | Only totally free plant identifier app I've found. So far free anyway. | Excellent | Despite being my favourite app so far I give it 4 stars in hopes that you'll add the features and details of plant care(ph,soil, fertilizer,watering, sunlight, season) and disease identification. Then it'll be a complete app and we won't need to Google every plant that we identify with this app. All the best. | Excellent! | Poor | This is a really great app to help identify plants, weeds and herbs. | Location didn't work. Kept suggesting Singapore while I'm in UK. | Mostly the app identifies accurately | Good app | Fantastic | It works great | Awesome app. Very accurate and helpful. | Basic and Useful | Sadly when loading a picture from the gallery the app freezes and closes down. When I reopen the app the pictures where loaded but ID was uncertain even when the whole inflorescense was visible and sharply defined. I really want to use this app. What's up? | Wonderful app, perfect for nature walks! Takes very sharp photographs, and the identification is always accurate. | Wonderful app for beginners | Got it right o the nose! | Excellent | Using it for last few years and it's a great and very helpful app. Till now all my plant identification was successful and accurate with these app | Very good | Having the background I can discern which ones most are after looking up on the app. Plantnet so far helps remind me on the plant name and species even if some pictures aren't as good. Thanks for providing suggestions. | Fantastic resource,so easy to use. | it's good but only for identification | Its a great app. | It's amazing and timely | Excellent citizen science app. I'm in Australia so expecting it to have some gaps in the flora data base, but users get to submit plants they can identify for inclusion. More users will improve the Australian collection. | Love this app! Really helps identify plants. | All over good | Nice appearance, stellar execution. No bombarding ads, yet install severely lacks basic instruction, leaving users guessing what & how to proceed. As another user said, tons of other's nearly useless photos consuming space. Are they combined in identification of plants, or merely for visual enjoyment? Much of this is great, some I don't see how to use. It is very useful. | Excellent Garden Helper | Great App!! Very handy when you don't know what you're looking at | One of the best apps for plant identification. It is completely free and has no adverts. Sounds to good to be true but I haven't experienced any issues with it. | I have got a wonderful experience from this application. It gives detailed information about species that are identified. Especially It is very useful to agronomists and people working with plants. It is the real identifier of plants!! | I love it and it's helping me a lot 🙂🙂 | great app. | Great job | Helped me identify heaps of plants. Love from Australia 🇦🇺 | Easy to use and very impressed at accuracy | Very good excellence | Nice | good | Hell yeH | Fantastic for garden plants worldwide. Simple and informative. Not so useful for Australian natives but at least helps ID the weeds! | 1000/10, cannot recommend this app enough! It's all open-source, and has a very consistent and high rate of identification. It's helped me identify a whole host of plants, so I know which ones are safe for my cat to chomp when I'm not looking. | I had already tested several types of plants the result was exact. Thanks | Has been excellent, so have recommended to many others | Excelent, i went through a lot of apps to find one that helped me identify a herb i needed for a tea. This one is perfect, just perfect | Great App! Convenient and works even if the plants are not native of the region you live in. The collaborative nature of the app is not 100% reliable though. You have to scroll down a bit from the first choice and observe carefully details to eventually identify the right species. But overall wonderful app, I cannot complain! | Nice project and identifier, but no data about caring | Worked on plant that was matured and dried out. | The accuracy of this app in identifying plants is really good 👍 | Everyday useful, almost always right | Great app and easy application Thanks | Great app | Working great! Amazing UI and just Great overall | Awesome | Excelent | Handy and free | Great App, identified 2 herb and 2 houseplants as well as a chilli plant. Another app asking for £7 a month. This is tremendous for free. I'm busy watching YouTube Bushcraft, where people are growing and farming exotic fruit and veg. I use this app to capture and identify produce. It is very accurate and so far, no failures. | Wring plant names | Mixed results | Very accurate | Very good app | Very useful in identifying plants | Best app | I think it's a great app but it would be good to have a audio icon that we can play so we can learn how to pronounce the latin | I read the info on this app before purchase. I thought it provided guidance on using it. I also thought it would identify my specific plant rather than compare my photo with hundreds in its database and ask me to pick which one was mine. That really isn't helpful to me. I also thought it would provide all the specifics for planting, light, watering fertilizing, and propagating. If it does all this, what am I not doing to get that from this app? | It's acurate all the plants that you searched and no ads free to search | Wonderful | This one is truly amazing, it helps me a lot to identify my plants, and it provides a lot of useful information and related pictures, thanks a lot | It's the best I have used! | Nice one | Very accurate and helpful | Amazing app. | Does an incredibly accurate ID job and I'm using a phone from 2017! | Great | Very good identifier | I'm not good at recognizing The name's or what is it | No subscription and it figured it out anyway. I approve. | Awesome and easy. Very accurate and in Costa Rica so far it helps and does identify a lot of plants and flowers | Bug report v3.17.4 This version does not read the GPS info of photos. The same photos' GPS location can be created by Google Photos and by iNaturelist | Noticeable lower usage starting latter half of 2023. | Amazing programme. It misses a bit of a database and organisational side but it works really well. It has not been trained well in recognising tropical plants of the Amazon basin | Fair but some time don't get detailed | A very good experience. Highly recommend. | Very helpfulf, I learned a lot of plant names | Quite good flower and leaf also | I'm very happy with it. It's easy to take a picture or upload a photo of the plant you want to identify once you are in an area with internet. Much easier to use than other apps with the same purpose. I do wish they had more info on the plants after they are identified but at least I can find out their names much faster than trying to use a book.","{""1"":7967,""2"":1867,""3"":6442,""4"":23939,""5"":195558}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","PlantNet","8292161998699316373","contact@plantnet-project.org","https://plantnet.org/",,"https://api.plantnet.org/views/terms_of_use","8292161998699316373","Education","EDUCATION","[{""name"":""Education"",""id"":""EDUCATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6p_UoXPjovHWARuVaOilwZzjIOzqltetjYkE9eQ9L9ZhgBb2Fbbl8LkVCf-k64k8Fw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KPSolZnKlLpty5nQunOJWi5OGlg2Wp2Qx6SbpX3208TNpfnqvesDLvc-fNTGyue80g","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SynFhkxTfmYbxMhUuDxrTU9njyfV2kJO5-Hz4VwdDxzMSy--YRaJHBmyr3KtnmsxeVQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3nPYFZqafpRP_zBq0_vHe2lYBEarZ-qPn7pll4QOnEjg56vYlHhacTT8S3SJbm2vAzo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ytsFgixT-m-amPw64SoVgQDvnQ1mVC0bhM6grnyHMk4ym_1K7W6IBiGbzmL0GSYH23s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DuIMwGhzCTG6vakEqq_LCfxPrT_-U_rII_fZjFfU_PK4qa52DJfO4NVrrShPRCSvgSZD"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y5y9f3FDiYKtxPQjMfolt9EhXEBHCebYaa9q784RbMOG8OQNdSzs4Xc0bQoTJuOb_DY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d7cqdFUp5Vdf9_fazAaW0kxI6Lb4xz84vChPjojyV7eM60TCo_afoBSOUcTobVzF9fA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y0PU2NEKcmcEmTlbmzT9aORAmPu-bEK3w9gDIQpL0V6r7RfBVQDa9dHdgRvFvhCSfw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uqPd0FHagloDKFnsfMP6bJ97jBavQDgNtvKvdlQeeV-pqTpMXbXZiq2l_yZR8gkEdoez"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YAIZS3B0Ho3MIHev1W3aLBUNhNEaUkJSrG5wHs3HorJEJKN-tN38as-tmhHlOaGV-WI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dhqgeemUUOHa37Euf02WgsfnFRD9rdp5zgjPSQsP0hSLEYXGNjp4h0AcJXPCKaQfbLE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4dIzzAddkyahTMvxRIckBHfhp_tIpJl3rTCDdMrf1ECpYxtzSNkbuQOk5AVqJcXq33w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5DdFSDejQOoe8XDFmZdSrJNMW9dfQBnOxu0PSyQ9mQWDrIhWuQwGGEZ0EMpkVouSSvtW""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jan 21, 2014",1710780972000,"3.17.6","- Added Belarusian and Occitan languages.<br>- Fixed critical fullscreen image bug.<br>- Implemented coarse geolocation for Android&#39;s flora selection.<br>- Enhanced group functionality.<br>- Added species-related features and fixes.","[""I love the simplicity of being able to take a photo to check the plant name.

W dodatku nie zawsze przychodzi SMS z kodem. Poza tym biedronka co chwilę wysyła mi SMSy z ofertą. | Ostatnio wieczny spam. Próbują udowodnić, że są najtańsi przez co tracą klientów. Gratulacje dla załogi mózgów z marketingu | Brak opcji wyłączenia denerwujących wibracji | Tylko do 02-04 voucher 2137zł przy zakup. za min. 69kg kremówek z kartą XD. | Often logs out.

And now It doesn't send SMS, so I can't sign in and use the app 😡 | It worked at first. Opens fine, then closed app when my phone out of battery, charged it. Opens app and asks me to log in. Tried but didnt give any sms. Asks me to update. I reinstalled and update it. Now its same issue is. I guess ill stick my card moja biedronka. | Zatrudnijcie kogos innego od backendu bo zyc sie nie da | After the latest update, it logged me out and is bugged when trying to log back in - so it doesn't work yet again. Please fix it. | Very often logs out. Login screen looks like web page from '90, not fully loaded, making it unusable when you try to open the while shopping. | Nowa aplikacja - znowu komplkacja! 1/2 godz zablokowana kasa. G Ł U P K I //Wieczny bajzel w tych sklepach to można rozumieć -chcą uchodzić za najtańszy sklep, ale żeby nie uznać zwrotu źle oznaczonego produktu to chamstwo. Kierowniczka nie odpowiada za błędne oznaczenie produktu i wykpila sie ze produkt chłodniczy nie podlega zwrotowi. Produkt nie opuścił nawet sklepu. Ciekawe jak ktos odkłada produkt po pół godzinie. Wrocław dworzec główny. | Spamuje SMSami | Otrzymuję głupawe smsy po aktualizacji aplikacji, na które nie wyraziłam zgody. Muszę zainstalować appkę ponownie, żeby usunąć to konto, bo to jakiś żart. | There is no possibility to avoid SMS spam (promotions, comparisons to competition). Had to delete account to do so. Please, add option to prevent SMS/notification spam. Currently, if you register, you are forced to receive spam. | Shakomat nie działa. Nagroda z shakomatu nie posiada obrazu, przez co nie wiadomo jaki produkt jest w promocji. | Używanie tej aplikacji wymaga zgody na otrzymywanie prawie codzienie sms z reklamami. | W Biedronce szynka wieprz. b/k pak. proz.

Szczegoly na biedronka.pl I tak co 2 dni taki spam na SMS. Tego się NIE da wyłączyć, nie da się też zablokować. | Od czasu aktualizacji dostaję SMSy i nie ma opcji ich wyłączenia. Brak możliwości wyłączenia wibracji przy korzystaniu. | Sama apka spoko, ale to długie ładowanie i brak cache jest tragiczne. Biedronka obok mnie jest w środku bloku gdzie nie ma zasięgu i jak zapomnę co miałem za kupony to musiałbym wyjść ze sklepu żeby spojrzeć (albo zrobić wcześniej screenshoty, tak, robię tak żeby się upewnić że dobry produkt biorę z półki). Może pomyślcie o jakimś cache już wyshakowanych kuponów? EDIT: Po update aplikacja ładniejsza ale powyższe ciągle aktualne. I TEN HEJT NA LIDLA, proszę już dość 😐 | After updating the app month or longer ago it becomes worst experience ever , so you can't login without phone , you can't delete your phone from app. They spam you with messages , I change phone to a random one , the new phone does not working the old phone does not working , they continue send you spam . All you can do delete the account it's the best way to solve all the bugs . But now I don't have account I just lost it and still continue receive it's spam. Fix - mark those sms as spam | Ceny nie zgadzaja sie z tymi przy kasach, nie stabilna, nie dziala czytnik do sprawdzania cen | Am I completely blind or there's no way for adding products to the shopping list from the main application screen? | Barcode recognition not work everytime and fast enough. Previous app did it with a speed of light. IMO some OCR problem. Lower rate also because of annoying SMS SPAM 😑 | Po aktualizacji aplikacji wymuszają zgodę na spam SMSowy, z którego nie da się wypisać bez rezygnacji z konta. Więc zrezygnowałem z konta. | brakuje wyszukiwania produktów po nazwie | Eee, stonka, nie przychodzi mi sms potrzebny do zalogowania się. | After capturing your phone number it sends you daily SMS marketing/ads without option to unsubscribe. | Nowa wersja aplikacji działa znacznie lepiej i do tego jest dark mode. Oby tak dalej! | Przestańcie wysyłać mi te smsy, nikogo to nie obchodzi (jestem za lidlem) Edit po odp: Pytanie jak to pozniej wyłączyc? | Not possible to regist without giving consent to send me commercial sms and mail | Nachalne smsy, brak możliwości rezygnacji z smsów rekalmowych bez kasowania konta. Aplikacja i tak nie działa stabilnie. Poza tym mają aplikacje i wysyłają smsy zamiast powiadomień przez Aplikację. Brak możliwości rezygnacji z reklam sms to jakiś skandal sam w sobie. Porażka, idę do Lidla, lepsza apka i nawet w rzeczywistości wychodzi mi taniej. | Lidl lepszy | problem z językiem. pomimo zmiany języka w ustawieniach na polski. nadal wyświetla mi j. angielski o oczywiście aplikacja jest po angielsku. | Wymagana jest zgoda marketingowa na kontakt prze sms, mms, telefon, mail, push. | no nie no, w tym update to się chłopaki postarali | Very God shopping biedronka store God food and all staff working god | it does not send sms to number. assume due to double add +48 to the phone number | Please remove the vibrations, they should not be forced and should not be turned on by default. I will be uninstalling the app until this changes. | I cannot login without allowing to send me commercial to my private number, push notifications, sms,... Don't you want to send me you commercial directly to my brain? | Po aktualizacji aplikacja chodzi dużo lepiej | Window shopper aaaa | Juz dziala. | Nowa wersja aplikacji jest dużo lepsza od starej. Dziękuję! | O wiele poprawił się design i UI aplikacji działa płynnie tym razem nie zmusza cię do czekania przez pół minuty na ładowanie i w końcu nie zmusza mnie do ciągłego odpalania lokalizacji | Bardzo podoba mi się ostatni update! | Unable to even register. Getting some bogus error message about unusual traffic | Bardzo źle działająca aplikacja. Wolno się ładuje. Shakeomaty generują promocje na wyprzedane produkty albo zniżki po 4%. Nie da się wyłączyć wibracji. Gdyby nie fakt że niektóre promocje wymagają aplikacji nigdy bym nie zainstalował. | Po aktualizacji UI wygląda jeszcze gorzej. Wciąż są problemy z działaniem - aplikacja sama się zamyka, zawiesza, ładowanie zajmuje wieki. Nie da się wyłączyć wibracji. Brawo, tylko chlewionka potrafi przenieść standard sklepowy na aplikację. | Nowa aplikacja działa stanowczo szybciej i sprawniej od poprzedniej - wielki plus za poprawę. Mam tylko problem z językiem aplikacji, pomimo wybrania polskiego, aplikacja dalej jest po angielsku... | Jestem zainteresowany i zadowolony | Po aktualizacji nie ma możliwości korzystania bez wyrażenia zgody na wysyłanie reklam. Byłem stałym użytkownikiem i poleciłem apke wielu osobom. Teraz z chęcią ją usunę każdemu komu pomogłem zainstalować. Mogliście chociaż pozwolić na wyświetlanie karty biedronki do tego raczej zgód marketingowych nikt nie wymaga... Dno dna... Ceny w sklepie są bardzo mylące kiedyś mogłem skorzystać ze skanera z aplikacji teraz już nie. Psujecie wszystko co tylko możliwe... | już wiele lepiej | po najnowszej aktualizacji ze zmiana interfejsu aplikacja działa nieporównywalnie lepiej. nie jestem pewien czy logowanie zostało w całości naprawione, czy działa wystarczająco skutecznie że już nie zauważam błędu z logowaniem gdzie trzeba było ubijać aplikacje i przełączać x razy tryb samolotowy. poprzednia wersja to solidne 1/5 które trwało od początku aplikacji praktycznie do teraz. nowa wersja ma bezużyteczny skaner, który nie czyta 8/10x. lista zakupów dno-ręczne wpisywanie nazw i brak cen. | New version is much better than the old one! | Guys you are amazing. The app now is perfect. Super fast with great design | Dlaczego nie ma oczywistej opcji dodawania produktów do listy zakupów z zakładki oferty (tylko dla ciebie, Biedronkowe oszczędności itd.)? | Nie wiem kto wam napisał tą nową aplikację ale w porównaniu z starą to jest jak niebo i ziemia. Wcześniej musiałem czekać 50 sekund żeby się załadowała, teraz otwiera się jak każda inna. Jest też o wiele bardziej responsywna i w mojej opinii ładniejsza. | wreszcie po aktualizacji aplikacja szybko się włącza, nie wyrzuca błędów z połączeniem i gazetki szybko się ładują szkoda tylko przycisku do wstrząsania shakematem (dziwnie jest faktycznie wstrząsać telefonem, nie chcę tego robić regularnie) i przydałoby się usprawnić nawigację po gazetkach (przycisk przewijania do następnej strony i suwak do szybkiego przeskakiwania wielu stron) | Nowa wersja aplikacji jest dużo lepsza od poprzedniej | Nowa wersja wymaga ode mnie zgody na telefony marketingowe. Ocena 0 & uninstall | Edit: dobra robota - nowa wersja aplikacji zdaje się rozwiązywać większość niedociągnięć, których dotyczyła moja poprzednia ocena. | Samsung Note 10+ (SM-N975F): ""Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network."" Not possible to pass registration step. | I can not even create an account. So, it does not work at all. | Nowa aplikacja niestety mnie co 2 dni wylogowywuje, a ponowne logowanie związane jest z wprowadzaniem numeru telefonu i przepisywaniu kodu otrzymanego przez sms. Bardzo uciążliwe i denerwujące to jest niestety | New version is much better than old one | Dodali czarny motyw więc ja zmieniam na 5 gwiazdek :) Dzięki Biedronka! | Hard to keep me authorised, even if i checked ""keep me logged in""??? | Nowa aplikacja to dno, w starej można było wejść we wszystkie promocje dla ciebie zrobić screen i mieć na telefonie teraz to porażka. | Upd.: Uninstalled the new version and rollback to the old. Thanks. Prev.: After the app update it forces to opt in to receive spam to my phone number or sms. There is no option to opt out. I don't want receive promotions to my phone number. | Updated version is very fast and smooth | Lubię Pani Bedrę | Zapisywanie się na zalewanie spamem przez sms/email w zamian za minimalne promocje które można wytrząsnąć z shakeomatu? Nie dziękuję, wywalcie to kompletnie bo nie ma opcji że ludzie będą chcieli się na to zapisywać | Caly czas dostaje informacje, ze nie moge sie zarejstrowac, bo aplikacja wykryla podejrzany ruch sieciowy | Dark theme is great in new version, but viewer of leaflets is downgraded, no more possible to fast scroll to certain page from preview mode, you have to scroll it one by one... it is not convinient=\ | The app logs out frequently | Coś strasznego... | It used to work great, slow at some point, but pretty stable - since upgrade to new version (2.0.1), it logs me out every two days, which is very annoying | Aplikacja cyklicznie się sama wylogowuje i wymaga ponownej autoryzacji sms'em. Problem nadal występuje i irytuje, a dostępnej aktualizacji, która skutecznie wyeliminuje problem - brak. | Nie można się zalogować do aplikacji pokazuje że moje konto zmigrowano do nowej aplikacji. Nie działa | Już działa. Cieszę się, że bardzo szybko się uruchamia w porównaniu do poprzedniej wersji 👍 | Zrobili jakieś zmiany w aplikacji i nie można się zalogować, straszny chłam | Pojawiła się nowa wersja aplikacja i w końcu mogłem zalogować się, jednak teraz po prostu nie działa. Nic się nie ładuje, cały czas jest komunikat i napotkanych przeszkodach. | Приложение просит авторизацию, но сайт не открывается. Перестало работать вообще... | New app doesnt work. | Nie działa od aktualizacji | The new version forces users to agree to receive newsletters and other commercial information too their phone numbers... Very nasty! | W końcu apka działa sprawnie, na co wszyscy czekali. Dziękujemy. | Finally, a functionable app. Good job, Biedronka. After all these years! | For me it got better, 5 starts to hard work | Nowa wersja aplikacji działa o wiele szybciej niż poprzednia, która była bardzo ciężka i powolna. | Super pomocna 😉 | Ok wróciło wszystko do normy. | Aplikacja bardzo niestabilna. Co 2 dni wylogowuje uzytkownika. | Fix it! | Codziennie a nawet wiele razy dziennie każe się logować, bez sensu Edit 15 stycznia: pomimo zapewnień nadal muszę się logować codziennie. | You've broken the auth, I have to login via SMS too often. It became better, first days after update I had to do it almost every app launch, but it's still annoying. | Aplikacja bardzo długo się wczytuje, częste problemy z połączeniem z serwerem. Od około miesiąca bardzo często pojawiają się różnego rodzaju błędy. | Programista chyba w trakcie kursu | Karta i aplikacja zarejestrowana na ten sam numer i co? I nie będzie zniżki, bo... Nie wiem dlaczego. Specjalnie wszystko komplikują. | Po zainstalowaniu nowej wersji nie jestem w stanie w ogóle się zalogować. Kompletna porażka. Update: Widzę że od dłuższego czasu macie ""małe techniczne problemy"" Strasznie długo wam idzie naprawienie tej aplikacji. | Bez sensu, ciągle mi wyskakuje, że mój numer przeniósł się do nowej aplikacji jakby dwie były, gdzie mój shakeomat ja się pytam xd | Cannot login. Asks to update, but no update available | Po aktualizacji wygląda brzydko, dalej się zacina i wiesza, problemy z zalogowaniem się ponownie. Nie da się zmienić języka. Edit. Działa, ładuje się bardzo szybko, tylko ilość shakeów w shakeomacie jest zdecydowanie zbyt duża. | Nie mogę się w ogóle zalogować do aplikacji, ponieważ wyskakuje komunikat by użyć najnowszej wersji, mimo zaktualizowania | Wylogowanie przed zakupami, a potem w trakcie. Skoro od paru dni informatycy pracują, to ja od paru dni częściej w Lidlu. | Slow, releases are broken. | App not working. Always says that I need to install latest app version. But I just reintall new version from goggle play | Not able to login. Everytime I login it's sending the same message that "" your account was moved to new Biedeonka app"". Is there a way to fix this? I have been struggling to login since last 2 weeks. | Keeps on requesting verification by phone number. The previous version was fine.... | Finally you did proper app with good design and nice optimisations. Please remove haptic vibrations, it's bad practice to enable it by default. Please place toggle in settings. Also found bug, when you have main screen with few elements, the scroll works only on this elements, the empty part is not scrollable. | I would fire PM because of this release. Previous was bad as well, btw. | Forgot to charge my phone and when i restarted it, the app told me to use only new version, reinstalled it and nothing, I opened a ticket and the reply was something like ""We have a bug...sorry"". Bravo people, next time make sure you test the update before you launch it. | Please add to your application a turn off option for vibration (imitation of a button pressing) for these screen ""buttons"": home, scanner, lists and more. | I don't thing i uave ever used an app so badly optimized as this is. It's unreliable, does not update offers when most of the stores are closed, leaflets section does not work properly and entire app freezes and refreshes every 3 seconds | After the most recent update I need to log on every single time I open the app. Useless at the checkout 🙁 | Nit able to login in Android mobile now(Pixel). After entering mobile number it shows error ""Your account was moved to new biedronka app"", but I don't see the new version in Play Store. It was very useful in the past especially for foriegners as it support English version. Now its really painful 😣 | Good | Aplikacji sie na produkcji nie testuje barany. | Wary nice 👌 Happy new years | maja dwa typy urządzen iphone Android nie ma mozliwosci uzywania konta zamiennie - aplikacja jest niezgodna między platformami. (nowa/stara wersja aplikacji) | Każde uruchomieniem aplikacji pyta o kod SMS pomimo zaznaczenia opcji 'zapamiętaj'. Odechciewa się używać.. | Edit: Aplikacja dalej działa jakby chciała a nie mogła, za każdym wejściem trzeba podać numer telefonu i kod co jest bardzo irytujące i zniechęca do używania aplikacji, szejkomat trzeba klikać z 20 razy zamiast 4 co także bardzo odrzuca. Aplikacja nie jest przejrzysta tak jak była przed aktualizacją. Update aplikacji na minus bardzo. | Not working properly | Requires extremely unreasonable marketing consent in order to even register an account. Uninstalled this garbage immediately. Read what you agree to and stay away. | Straszna autoryzacja. Niezdolny do logowania. | ta nowa aktualizacja aplikacji jest świetna, ale naprawdę denerwujące jest to, że każdego dnia raz po raz pyta o mój numer telefonu. Trzeba to naprawić. To bardzo denerwujące | Po aktualizacji pojawił się u mnie problem z logowaniem, więc od razu napisałam maila. Dzień później problem jest już rozwiązany, a aplikacja działa poprawnie (przynajmniej na razie) | Nowa wersja ponawia prosbe o logowanie na moja biedronka - codziennie, wyjątkowo uciążliwe. Dodatkowo przy próbie reinstalacji przez pobranie aplikacji na nowo, wyrzuca bład, ze kontobzl ostało przeniesione do nowej wersji. ""Płonący śmietnik"" nie oddaje dokładnie wątpliwej przyjemności korzystania z tej appki. | I like the new redesign, but I have to login manually with a SMS code pretty much every 2 days or so. I have your account for a long time and I'm pretty sure that the app isn't working as intended. | Porażka. Ściągnęłam nowa wersje aplikacji, wczoraj dziala bez zarzutu. Dzisiaj już nie działa, pokazuje że coś poszło nie tak i żeby spróbować później. Odinstalowałam ja, zrestartowałam telefon i zainstalowałam na nowo. Teraz pokazuje mi się ekran żeby się zalogować lub założyć konto. Próbowałam obie opcje, ale dalej nie działa. Jak klikam "" załóż konto"" pokazuje mi komunikat, że moje konto zostało przeniesione na nową wersje aplikacji i żeby ją używać, ale ja przecież taką właśnie mam. | Nowa aplikacja nie dziala,strona logowania nie ładuje się mimo dostępu do internetu","{""1"":7327,""2"":1265,""3"":1532,""4"":2198,""5"":19451}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Biedronka","Biedronka","bok@biedronka.pl","https://biedronka.pl",,"https://moja.biedronka.pl/polityka-prywatnosci/","Biedronka","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BqoVMNLyEheHv9lU9ygtpsET3R69S0n6q8_HblX4LNQjlHKqw4sDmcAdBwev-uKvoNBW","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y1bEkYTKNPQbU1wLzMiW8jug0XhxTx9EWttujw7anY8XHmjcQ5VJuV1IYpZ_j4PPts4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/O9eWvhnjTild0JcFGgmnvQtwamI4QX6ZWr4liZvboghL2U3Oz_4rott3ZD3kDC1hJw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bKUCUijm0vt1rlAWcZqqp1Z1rZHAMtzRJbw3dH-uGIJTP-mRmtisljy9qB06wobjRyo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R1LEDfFP3ewETc-vEmcUsf8Fkmaz-D1_-U1fK3jVBu4Q5T9p6vnZr7PHjIeazxPd-w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6S4sCsZ5RmvEML_uKKEjqSD5PjrfE_iL21e46lMW1GeyyZ8lB-oUO8_FQOUy6PoEbivy"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vHSdIV39A9kwO4t-d0GI_s89cuTtAV54c-MCbG7w427ZfEA_XJvTKjNfpZZQ9cZ98N4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KKWxmVTgGR7ohqRZOyBQ8CAoUe1PqNeJJIu9xQO3h0tH1AwUr0aZpgMbHYOV7fu5yaI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cUbWpVNDsOfO7jCP_4lCDg4UsRRQ5-vjoUk4W9ng4XZkQhjhM7ysYQ4a3wHtKwSLQDyx"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VBBbU6SzwMI8lIS4rm8lqqzsfXFymsDyX4LnkK1WmJtSOroMrHsrjU6fIuSU83HM8w""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 31, 2022",1711094747000,"2.3.1","Kolejne nowości nadchodzą:<br>1. zmiany na liście zakupowej - lepiej widoczna opcja usuwania listy oraz mniejsze poprawki<br>2. widoczność płatnosci BLIK bez kodu na karcie Moja Biedronka<br>3. możliwość wyłączenia efektu wibracji w ustawieniach aplikacji<br>4. poprawki dotyczące stabilności i wydajności aplikacji.","[""App is hot garbage.

Imposible to access since I couldnt set a User Name durign registration The dump part is: there is no option to put a USERNAME durign the registration process. | It is a terrible app, I have registered and when I try to insert my username and email is just keeps stating unexpected error, terrible app and non existent support | Very non-intuitive ""transfer"" of account. Anyways, survived trough it, only to get to the screen' you must agree to our privacy policy' . Read trough it. Uninstalled the app right after it. Never going to agree to this! Edit: I wroite in English. They replied in Czech. And on top: their answer has nothing to do with my comments and concerns on the privacy ! | Guys, are you serious? So you made rebranding, and after that, I need to spend half an hour logging in again? Who are your PR and IT managers? You need new ones :) It will be good with IQ more than 50 at least | Jumped through a million hoops to finally log into my account and now u can't get through the phone number verification setup. I did it twice, all the way to entering the code u sent and it just throws me back to the start. I hope your company goes bankrupt so someone more capable can take over. | Very buggy, laggy, doesn't connect most times, always changing login methods to go through loops of connections that doesn't make sense. Badly designed app. | Not accessible!! | Nefunguje, jsem jen zaseklá na uvítací stránce... | Když musím na záložce účtů hledat své účty mezi reklamou, tak mi přijde, že Sodexo už kleslo hodně hluboko a nikde nemůžu najit placenou verzi aplikace bez reklamy 🤔 | Unable to login to my account with my company email. No problem with login on PC but in the app it is impossible. | Dear team, Please work more on UI and make it user friendly in terms of content that you show us. Button, cards, and overall looks like 5 years back design. So please improve. Thank you | Funguje přesně tak jak má, platby také funkční. | Nevím proč, ale nelze přistoupit k sodexo connect link. Zkoušel jsem mockrát ale bez úspěchu. Je to móc nepříjemné vzhledem k tomu že není možné sledovat stav účtu. Jsem správně registrován na nový connect system. Update: Den který jsem psal komentář, vůbec mi ne nabízelo aktualizovat aplikace a měl jsem poslední aktuální verze. A do mobilu samozřejmě používám Chrome browser. Teď už funguje přístup. | I am mad with your last update, it completely ruined the bearly working buggy app. Change yor security architect. I am truly sorry my company forces me to use your service, if this can ne a service at all. | Excellent app. Has two screens. On 1st you have Login Sodexo Connect button which brings you to Welcome screen with Continue button (why🤦‍♂️?) which brings you back to the Login Sodexo Connect screen. Fun! My cards didn't work over the weekend, couldn't login to web or mobile app. On Monday I was able to reach the helpline. Today login page down for maintenance. Now it's back and my card doesn't work, can't login to mobile app, only the webapp. Updating your SW after Xmas party, or? | Update: No a to je právě ten problém. Kvalitní aplikace to umí přepnout do češtiny i na systému v jiném jazyce. Původní hodnoceni: Na systému s angličtinou nelze přepnout do češtiny?! | It's not able to let me log in, at all it's been already for 1, the same. No change at all, and customers service it zero, they are replying to the emails, after almost 2weeks. Very bad. | Since it has moved to sodexo connect the saved account gets forgotten and cached in the browser. It's easy to log out accidentally and the app tried to include virtual card payment which conflicts with Google wallet. That feature should just be dropped in favor of allowing the card to be added to Google wallet directly. Also the amount of commercials make the app fully of useless information. | Proc mi ztezujete pristup k mym, nikoliv vasim penezum? Sodexo connect nechci nepotrebuji. Jedine co chci je widget ktery mi ukaze zustatek na katre aby vam nic neuvizlo za nehty. Tim ze prostredky ktere jste kvuli legislative nazvali kredity a tim je lze zcela legalne nechat propadnout. Na co aplikace? Proc tohle delate? | Existuje snad ještě hloupější aplikace než je tahle? Vůbec nic to neumí a akorát s tím jsou problémy a teď už ani ta jedna jediná funkce, ke které to šlo využít, tak nefunguje.. no lol. | It doesn't let me login, however the account works on the websit. | You have to switch to the card section of the app to use NFC which is very annoying. | now I cannot login. invalid email address. we do not even know when it will work again...that is not so great support | They made the app even more complicated. Now I need even a 2nd account called Sodexo Connect to check my balance. | Ruined by the ""Sodexo Connect"", you have to create this Sodexo Connect account even thou you alredy have the account at Sodexo. Waist of time just to check the balance. I don't need nor want this app while you still can check it online thru web. | Naprosto příšerný systém přihlášení, udělal jsem si ten nový účet a propojil si ho se starým a když se přihlásím tak se to bez asistence webu neobejde. Hrůza | Nejenom, že aplikace začala požadovat 2FA, ale taky se pravidelně odhlašuje. Takže sice můžu bankovní účet s hodněcifernými částkami v CZK, USD a čemkoliv jiném spravovat jen přes otisk prstu, ale Sodexo, kde mám směšných 1400 na stravenkách a 600 na flexipasech mám zabezpečený jak Pentagon. Paráda! | I cannot log in. On PC(web) account works fine. Just horrible app as the Sodexo app for card NFC payments | Po upgrady se nelze prihlasit, system nezna email ani tel. | After years of nonproblematic use i cannot login - ""unknown email address"" yet using the same on web page works fine! | Nebyl jsem s aplikací spokojen nijak zvlášť ani před posledním updatem, ale po poslední aktualizaci je to ještě výrazně horší. Integrování placení do jedné aplikace? Na papíře ok. Realita - ""vyžadováno opětovné přihlášení"" u každého nákupu a než se proklikam všemi kroky, tak to trvá víc jak půl minuty/minutu, což ve frontě všichni oceňují. Slíbená integrace do Google Pay nikde, zatímco Apple Pay funguje už měsíc a půl... Bez reakce při odeslání emailu na podporu. | It doesn t let me log in! Everytime totally forgeting my account set up and asking me to register again although I have an account and saved it for easy log in. I have to uninstall and install again. Then it finds my account. But next time the same issue! Is it that complicated to program such an app?! | good | Why doesn't it allow me to log in and says that email address doesn't exist, when I can log in without any issues on the website? Why did it wipe my log in credentials after update and doesn't allow me to log in cause problem mentioned above? | Why they made ti so complicated now... why do i need some new account, why do they want my mail and phone number, why does the password need special character, why I can't log in anyway.... why make things more and more conplicated... | How can we have mobile payments for Android users please? | Overly complicated. | After using the app on Android, I installed the app to my iPhone, just to have an apple pay on my secondary mobile device. Now, it seems like I can no longer use the app on the android, after enabling apple pay. Is that correct? I can't login to Android app. Or am I doing something wrong? | Jedna aplikace na placení, jiná na přehled a nejde to dát do google pay. Otřes | Works ok. Nothing special, nothing bad :) | Aplikaciou nie je mozne platit alebo pridat kartu do google pay | Please put sodexo in the name of the app! I hate to use play store to open it... Add the ability to hide accounts that are not being used | 1) Sodexo personal account and 2) Sodexo mobile payment should be placed on one app. | Can't use a bit older app. Forced update | Inconvenient UI of the app. When you are on the page for reporting problems, it is impossible to switch between CZ & EN versions. The message with the reported problem is sometimes cannot be sent, the reason is not clear. It is impossible to attach images to the message from user to Sodexo. | Good | Pin reset doesn't give notification, the pin won't be available for unclear amount of time and card is unusable. | All fine, but missing dark mode. | Používal som aplikáciu cez rok. Posledný mesiac ale vôbec nefunguje (chyba pripojenia k serveru). | When I'm trying to log in, I always get a message ""Server is not responding, try again later"" for past couple of days. | Barely usable due to the amount of self promotions and commercials which take 90% of the screen. After the last update is hard for me to even identify where among the all commercials and spam I can see my actual accounts. Disgusting. | Pretty good but it could be better | Cannot connect to the server. I have tried multiple times from different networks. | The dev is right. Touch ID works but may need a data and cache reset! | Poslouží. | Ježíš co to je za jméno? Jak to mám asi najít v seznamu aplikací? Proč se to nejmenuje prostě ""Sodexo""? Nebo aspoň ""Sodexo osobní účet""? Takhle to podle abecedy nenajdu. Ještě přidejte na začátek ""Můj"" a bude to nejhorší název ze všech. Omg why is Czech name ""Personal account Sodexo""? How am I supposed to find it in the drawer sorted by alphabet? Can't you rename it to have word Sodexo first? The only thing missing to make it the worst name ever is adding ""My"" at the beginning. | Po dnešní aktualizaci, nefunkční. Android 12 | OneMenu I tried to order finally with OneMenu inside your application and it was soooo complicated. When I finally made the order and paid, then after 5 min restaurant replied that they are not accepting this order. I will rather go and use Wolt. | Great app | Not the worst app but not the best either | Velký špatný. Velmi špatné vyhledávání, nemožnost získat detail nebo i jenom jméno pokud jsou dvě provozovny na jedné adrese, celkově tragické ovládání. | Nechápu k čemu to je, když inzerují podniky, které na místě karty neberou. Vyhozené peníze | Working great. | Automatic one star review for harassing me to review the app. | Nepoužitelné. Mapa sama o sobě nic nezobrazuje, je potřeba filtrovat, některé body se v mapě i při přiblížení zobrazí jako číslo a ne jako konkrétní provozovny, vyhledávání je otřesné, neobsahuje detaily a nepodporuje ověření obličejem. Už prosím ty šílené stravenky zrušte. | It doesn't support widgets, it will be nice to see balance without open the app. | all good | pretty good | Always I have to search for things and how to do stuff. It's not user friendly at all. | Aplikace nefunguje. Nelze se přihlásit. | Leasiure account is not consistent, companies official support also admitting that they wrote here misinformation. | A COMPLETELY useless filter and search engine for places where you can pay with the flexi pass card. Naprosto nepouzitelne vyhledavani mist a firem, kde se da platit flexi pass kartou. | I have to give one star for Sodexo in general as when you are given a new card (I changed the employer), you need to create a completely new account to be able to use the new card. | It's fine, but there is a bug, that ""today remaining"" parameter does not take into account the actual balance. The ""today remaining"" could show greater amount than the balance. | Terrible app, the search function is appalling, there is no way to get a proper list displaying in spite of the filter, no access to voucher ordering, nor primary account information. Just horrible. | Neposílají stravenky (peníze) včas, někdy i o 2 týdny pozdě. Je to na prd, nedá se na ně spolehnout. | The app contains tons of advertisement with no ability to turn them off or hide. Very annoying. | Awful app - crashes, does not work | Nefunfuje, zrušit. | terrible app together with mobilni platby, wont let you pay unless selected as default method and app actually opened, no Gpay support...not worth installing, stick to physical card and web account if you can | Sometimes works but sometimes withoyt any reason I cannot pay with this app - in the I need to carry the plastic card. It makes the app useless. And the fact that you split the functionality that should be kept in a single app into 2 useless apps makes things even worse. I would give 0 stars if it was possible. | refund not received in 30 days. Poor support. | It stopped working 1month ago. It does not see the internet connection anymore. If it doesn't get fixed soo I will uninstall it. | I can't register to the app | Nový dizajn fajn 5*, dolné menu bez textu až po kliknutí -1*, nemožnosť zmeniť jazyk v nastaveniach lebo je to nastavené na lokalizáciu telefónu -1* (ps ale hlavne ze notifikácie sú CZ)... NFC platba možná len cez ďalšiu externú appku -1*...To menu by mi až tak nevadilo ale nútiť ma stiahnuť ďalšiu appku pre platby cez nfc sa mi vážne nepáči | bad worse app | ne radi placanje putem mobilnog telefona | waste app | Aplikace vecne hlasi, ze neni pripojeni k internetu... nelze ulozit heslo ani se prihlasovat otiskem prstu... jedine na co tuhle aplikaci clovek potrebuje, je zjistit zustatek na karte a ani to nejde vzdy... | no internet connection na mobilu, kterym jsem stahnul aplikaci. Pliiiz | good | superb experience everyone please check the rating before downloading I have seen stupid apps getting 4+ rating still this app gets 2star 😠 don't waste your valuable time on silly trashes like these | Nelze nastavit jazyk aplikace jiný než máte v mobilu což je velmi nepraktické když máte os mobilu anglicky. Můžete tuto volbu přidat? | Velmi často se stává že mě aplikace nepřihlásí a stěžuje si na to že nejsem připojen k internetu i když samozřejmě jsem. Vyhledávání partnerů je neohrabané. Určitě je zde hodně co zlepšit. | Searching is terrible, lot of places, which accepts gastro pass, aren't even listed. | Doesn't correctly show places on map = useless | Can't open app, all time crashing. | ""The information could not be retrieved from internet. ""- not working so only 1star for now | This app seems to have a few bugs. For a few days now, I cannot open it and check my balance. Please fix the issue. Thanks. | Aplikace odrazuje už tím, že neumožňuje uložit heslo. | Upravujem po polroku. Prihlasenie sa zlepsilo. Vyhladavanie je stale 
hrozne, co je smutne, nakolko to je hlavna funkcia appky Navyse su vase 
tvrdenia zavadzajuce a klamlive. Gastro ako tak ide. Multi/flex

velky a vyznamny partner) a cuduj sa svete...nevzalo to platbu kartpu. Po 
roku uz by ste mohli tieto muchy vychytat!!! | Jakou informační hodnotu má ta animovaná pizza fakt nechápu. Zbytečně se 
tím ubírá místo na displeji. Funkcionalita je na místě, ale rozhraní je 
naprosto podivné. Doporučil bych podívat se na Material design guidelines

Easy to use. | 80 is my address, not 78 ?? | Good ⛸️ | Very satisfied with the app so far. Seems to be accurate and has additional excellent features. I'm using the free version. The ads don't bother me. | Forecast is wrong. | I love Meteored, i have been finding all the information really helpful and it is more reliable than B.O.M. | a good weather guide | haven't had this app long enough to rate it a 5 star but will give it a 4 star for now. i like many things about it. | This has been quite an accurate weather app. Would recommend to others. | 👍 | u need to update your gps it doesnt know my address but it knows every other house i go to and its full of adds its ok when it knows the address im guessing u have to buy so called premium to get your own proper address hahahahha | 👍👍👍👍👍 | Pretty good app but ads are super scammy. I get the need for ads to support a product but ones that lead to malware are not cool. Uninstalled the app after getting a ""Your phone has updates available"" fake ad. | great app | Very good. | brilliant app. | Very good | handy to know what to expect in the weather each day | Thank you | Awesome App. for weather... | awesome 👌 | Too much ads | very good | What a great app to have!! It helps me when I travel. | Great app so far subscribed premium finding one negative. That would be lack of radar choice on Main Screen , it only provides satellite view. Some customization allowing user to add Weather Radar map would be nice. | Love this app 😊 | Brilliant ! And accurate! Tried many- this from every aspect is the best!!( especially for an 86yr old!! ) cannot think of any way it could be improved. .well done.! | It is a good app , lots of information, by far the most complete weather app I have used | 80 % correct | I really like the layout.

One of the best, | Inputting my home addresses for the app and it refuses to accept the address and not only that, it refuses to accept the city that I input. My address must always be correct.

At least have an option to hide sections I don't want to see... | I like very much I will use it again | Good app. | best weather app I've had. very accurate. | Great app, and quite accurate. | Great app | Wow its so well designed it makes the day brighter .The other apps are so badly designed I'm never certain what day it refers to for weather . They seem incapable of putting the name of the day clearly on top of the weather forcast . | Not accurate at all! | After trying about six weather apps, I chose this one. The one I had no longer exists. The search was a little frustrating but that search is done. I'm glad I found this one. | Thanks for the excellent work | Great design | O melhor app do tempo em Portugal! | Best weather app hands down, especially when travelling overseas. Very comprehensive and as accurate as a weather app can be. Great job. Was well worth going premium too. | I have found this weather forecast site to be very good | really good 👍 informative and helpful, there when I need weather reports for the day | it nice to have meteored.to find out what the whether | the very best weather reports ever first class | superbly accurate | radar doesn't seem very accurate, sorry | Great 👍 a very good look 2 it | nice app | clear graphics, easy to read | Quality forecast app, with good information which is usually accurate | Very awesome | Nice Weather App | I only want weather. no news or ads | no advertising | Wow! This is a very well layed out weather app! The only thing missing is a 4 x 1 widget that shows icon and current temp, high and low, current time with current location above it. | It was 5 stars, as soon as I gave the app a 5 star rating, I got a full screen video ad, so it just lost a star. | So far so good, I hate adds so I went premium straight up. Cheap for the year. I've only had it for a couple of weeks (the heatwave) so I'm yet to see how it handles a '4s in 1d' scenario. | better and more accurate than weather bug | Best weather forecaster yet | Great app | The app is on point with weather location on the other hand needs help it gets my address but then switch the name which only a suber area | This is the most accurate Weather app that I have found for my locality. I love the tremendous level of detailed data presented, and now it works correctly with tablets, and the spurious icons (e.g. Humidity icon with an incorrectly associated 18° temperature value) have now been removed allowing the correct icons and their values to be displayed. Devs were a bit slow in responding, presumably to fit in with their work and release cycle, but they've fixed it as requested | Awesome, pretty accurate. | 👍 | i love it accurate forecast all the time | well rounded app, great for use when wind monitoring is needed | Fantastic to change the Devils tone of modern music to a harmonious frequency for us. | pretty good | Great app for weather forecast 99% coreect forecast | love this app | very good | Very accurate and precise! | best Weather App | GREAT! | the best weather ap I have ever used! it gives you the correct wind speed/gusts. now I don't have to go into the national weather database. | good | Purchased Pro version, but didn't refresh on Samsung Galaxy 23 ultra . | Accurate and an excellent weather app. But don't have the humidity information. I hope it will be upgraded with all necessary informations. | so far I like it. will update more later | love this app it's got very relevant and accurate information. highly recommend | Those 800+ advertising companies, lots of suspicious names in that list. Even if I refuse them all, seeing the other reviews where the devs beg us to let them sell our data doesn't instill trust. | thanks for accuracy | I've tried other apps and this one is the most accurate. When it says rain it will rain in within 5 minutes of the time specified. When other apps say rain it means sometimes during the day it could rain between 1 minute and 10 hours | Store says this app has a watch tile, but that seems to be false. | Awesome app! Great info and detail | It kept thinking I was 10+ miles away so I tried to get into the settings and found an INSANE number of companies to block, if you don't want them sharing your data with them ....and you have to do it twice. I spent probably 20+ minutes going through the first list, rejecting all these advertising (aka spying) companies, only to come to a second huge list. I gave up, and just uninstalled the whole app. This is absurd. I might've kept it if there was an easy way to reject all of them at once. | Good | Love the layout. So easy to access. | nice working app | You not only got the forecast for today wrong, but you didn't even give an accurate temperature of the NOW temperature. What has weather forecasting accuracy changed in the past 100 years? Doppler Radar has made it worse. You went from 10 minutes Tornado warning to 15 minutes warning in 100 years. People pay a high price to become a Meteorologist , which means what?? They still can't get an accurate 3 day forcast. | A really fast and so far accurate prediction nice1 thanx | I love this app and more especially I love the satellite images of the prevailing weather system. | amazing and most complete weather app. | very accurate | It's a gr8 app and it's not too expensive to sub, thank you for all your hard work. I still can't find the humidity! | very good app tells me what I want to know. I would recommend it. | So far so good, easy to use, all information I need accessible | easy to navigate and understand | It is not very accurate for Chile, which free one is better? | LUV!! | no option to hide redundant address or clock elements from widgets | works great and lots of info. plenty of days ahead forecast | perfect weather report❤ | lts the Best Weather app I've ever had! | great weather app | Awesome weather app ever!! It forecasts the hourly weather thus letting you know what to expect in the next hour. Never a bad day with Meteored. | quick and quiet accurate | Great | Veri nice | This is normally a great app. Not sure what's gone wrong exactly but every time I try to enter a location, it flashes an error up on the bottom of the screen (obscuring the keyboard!!) saying something about it's location services having issues. This has been going on for days if not weeks now. Turned a great app into a useless one. | great | Nice so far.. | The app is very good so far. Installed Tues 5 March 2024. Previously the app showed the time and temperature. Now it shows the app Icon which has to be tapped to open the weather details for my home location. Is it possible to return to showing the time & weather details rather than having to tap on the app Icon to see the weather details ? | Why should it make me happy?? | Nice weather app, all the info I need about the coming weather | I tried lot's of weather aap but I found this aap is very accurate and reliable and trustworthy | So detelled | Clean and easy to read | Brilliant app wind direction warnings of rain also, the whole job, thank you. | awesome app!!! bang on with rain radar! | Awesome app apart from Google's adds | Easy to access reliable information. | works well but occasionally doesn't update weather till open it | Easy app with less ads and more versatile.

Quick delivery and you can send stuff back if it doesn't fit you, no charge. Decent prices. | Problems with orders.I received 2 times a different item. It's frustrating to pay 2 times for something I didn't want and had to wait till it returns to them to get my money back.maybe a delivery with a check of the items you order,would be better. | 👍 | Great app. Whatever I've bought from there it is of good quality and it fits. | Won't open ads links. Always says error. Trash app. | Odlično | Cea mai idioata aplicație posibilă unde îți este imposibil sa faci un retur! O mârlănie românească jegoasă! NU RECOMAND | My experience with the app is good | Perfect expirience | superb | Imi place | ok | Super ! | Лесно и бързо пазаруване, удобен интерфейс. | Fake advertisement from non-existent items. Immediate uninstall. | Great! | Excepcional | So far, so good | Impossible discounts. Great selection of clothing and of top quality. | Ωραίο app, με ποικιλία σε brands και αριθμό ρούχων και βάζει και προσφορούλες. | App zeigt ständig schwarzen Bildschirm. Shoppen kaum möglich. | Click bait | Cele mai tari reduceri de pe internet!! | I can't choose a language only country. I don't speak the official language of a country I'm currently living in. | Buggy | Huge delays, everytime... I'm deleting the app and never buying anything from you again, ever... | Viena no manām top online iepirkšanās aplikācijām. Ļoti ērta, parocīga un vieglo saprotama. | Recomand. Echipamente mai calitative decât cele ce se găsesc pe plan local. | I dont like the fact that I cannot remove my expired card from the app. In addition, I couldnt replace it with another visa. I had to use mastercard instead. | App is ok, but the prices TWICE more expensive than in other shops. Makes no sense to use it. | So far it's been great to use, but there's an issue now. The app seems to be refreshing every X seconds and each time it does, the list of items I'm shopping goes back to the begging and I have to scroll down to where I left off... Please review this bug, as it is rather annoying. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S21 5G and my app is up to date. Thank you | please have an option for English language | Does not allow you to leave a bad review about the product. | You got me staring at Jungkook for half an hour, crying and smiling at the same time like look at my boy, how far he has come, I'm so proud of him and look, due to him I will give you 5 stars | Love the offers, the products are awesome and if something doesn't fit, the return process is so easy. Love it! | Значи ако може да не лъжеш хората пишейки ,,моделът е висок 1,77"" а накрая да се окаже, че сигурно моделът няма 1,50 | So far no issues with orders and returns. Sometimes it takes a week or two to have the items delivered but if I'm getting a good deal that's not an issue. Would love and express service though. | I'm addicted to About You. Amazing stuff and prices. Love them:) | Sve super osim dostavne službe koja često traži da se dođe po paket u poštanski ured umjesto da mi dostave doma. | Grate app, I only wish there was an ecological packaging option. | bagi adresa la care locuiesti , iar aplicatia alege alta adresa | very nice prices | Great app! There are many options that make shopping much easier. Includes discount coupons. | Hjemmeside lokker med 25% ekstra rabat til nye App kunder. Jeg indtaster at jeg handler til mænd, hvorefter jeg får en 25% rabatkode til kvindetøj? Simpelthen spild af tid. Måske havde jeg overset noget, men dobbeltjekkede og der stod intet om at det kun var for kvinder. | - The sales are great, just gotta be patient! - I am being shown non-caucasian models, even though I am in a caucasian part of the world and there's no option to disable that. - The shoes ordered through this app. seem to be different in size than the shoes of the same make and size bought in-store. | Product prices are different when you open a product and add it to cart. | Easy to purchase , fantastic range amd great quality . | simple fast app and great choice of wares | I like this app. I can order using cash and thats a big green flag for me! | Great app for savings on a wide range of brands. | Perfectly happy with the app, great selection of brands at really good prices/discounts. Best shopping experience. | Great app | Great App, easy to navigate! Totally recommend! | Easy to use, great promotions, many lovely brands! | Excellent app | great app, well optimized | This review is not about the functionality of the app. For anyone interested in the misleading 25% discount of the first order through the app, it is only for specific products/gender. Bait promotion not appreciated. | It would be perfect if the app will even open. I tried for 3 time to reinstall and didn't work. Best app.... | Dali su mi iznošene tenisice grozno ! | Fake. Orders never arrive. Probably they are thieves | Έχω αρκετό καιρό την εφαρμογή, έχω παραγγείλει 4-5 φορές και είμαι αρκετά ικανοποιημένη πρέπει να πω. Βάζουν συχνά εκπτώσεις, έχουν ποικιλία, στα περισσότερα προϊόντα όλα τα νούμερα είναι διαθέσιμα, η παράδοση γίνεται σε πολύ σύντομο χρονικό διάστημα | The service they offer is decent, however they made me realise how cringe today's fashion standard is. -1 point. More than half of the men's collection was rather made for ""women"". -1 point. Please make a separate ""other"" category so men can finally look for actual trending clothing instead of wearing a clown suit. 3/5 | Много ми харесва вашата платформа | Super application | Really easy to use app, nice pictures and not content heavy. Recommendations work great too! | I think it is one of the coolest apps for women. They have a very large range of clothes, accesories, etc and the prices are good. Even if they are a bit more expensive, i like the quality and the fact that i can always give them back and get my money back. So, thumbs up from me! | I like this app thank you about you | Nice | I really like this app, which is easy to navigate and order. Would be nice if you could read people's opinions about the clothing instead of just seeing their rating. I have ordered and returned more than once and never had any kind of problems,on the contrary, they usually process my orders faster than promised 😊 The only thing that could really be improved is the size advice on the boots. It would be very useful to have the circumference of the ankle and the top of the boots plus the height | Great app to order clothes or shoes. | Sent wrong item | payment had to be restarted about 20 times until it finally worked since the app always kept closing. tried with all payment methods, all the same. after an hour of struggle I finally got it to work. | Odlično | Good choices with a few flaws.

The best is the great choice of items and brands. | Great service. | trag in aplicatia voastra, nimic nu merge | I have been using this app for almost 3 years and i had no problems with it. The products are a good, as well as the prices. There are a lot of costum deals that they give you and they are useful every once in a while. I recommend!! | Great experience so far, will continue to shop here! | Am comandat un cadou pe 13 și încă nu a venit! Nici nu a fost predata comanda curierului. Rușine. Sunteți cei mai praf din Romania 👎 | I like About you | fast easy good price | Good product as they shown and the delivery is good | During Black Friday promotion I ordered 14 products in 1 order. The order was confirmed. After waiting for 2 weeks I contacted the support to check on my order. They said that my order will not be completed due to a mistake on their end. They made me fill out a form I guess just so they can protect themselves. After almost a month and a huge hassle with 42 emails in total I received none of the ordered products. They promised me a 30% coupon and a refund. I still haven't received any coupon. | Great app | The best Shopping app | I love it | Easy to use | obuća dolazi u neorginalnom pakiranju, veličinom i kvalitetom ogromne razlike od orginala.

There are many other apps where I order sg from, and I get it in 1-2 days. Here it is different! I always have to wait at least a week, then if I have some problems with the items, it takes so long to get my money back! This time I had to ask them about the items I sent back, and after two days of waiting, I only got an automatic message! Can't wait to get my money back, and I will never order anything from them! | I can't add in the favourites more than 300-400 products ... I am limited to 170 ...

The only thing I dislike is that you can only search for products, no content results will come up. The website shows both products and content related to my search. You can browse inspiration on a particular room, but only random pictures, can't search for ""minimalist hallway"" for example. If I want inspiration on ""small living"" or ""shared bedroom"" I still go to the website. | This app has made my ability to find the amazing organizational items I need. This is dangerous for my pocketbook | Looooooove the app! Everything clearly displayed and explained with dimensions 😍 Love shopping on the app 🥰 also love making my shopping list on the app so I go to the shop to check it in person before buying 🥳 Thank you!! | Ikea kündigt 7h Lieferzeit Zeitfenster an, man nimmt sich extra frei und dann funktioniert weder die Lieferungsverfolgung noch wird in dem Zeitenster geliefert. man sitzt sich einen Tag lang, an dem man sich extra frei genommen hat, den Hintern platt, hat keine Ware und ist genervt. Als Kontakt oder Hilfe gibt es einen Chatbot auf der Seite, der nur sagt, man würde sich melden wenn nicht heute noch die Ware kommt. Da wäre es billiger gewesen einen Transporter zu mieten aber arbeiten zu gehen. | Good layout of interface. Easily navigatable | No 1 worestest app | Unable to login. I used my credentials that are correct, it said I need to login through browser, but the browser won't let me, so it told me to click the three dots and open in app. The app it directs me to is the old one which doesn't work.. I then created a new login in the app and right away after completing, it says same thing, cannot log me in. | Easy to create a shopping list and plan for a trip to ikea | Great app! I would love to be able to use the designer tools from my phone too. | Amazing | 😁❤👍 | Easy to use, practical, and helps to pay for your items while browsing in the store. | Ikea has stores all over the globe and surely this app exists in many languages, so why language options are so strict and do not allow users to chose English (for example) with every country store (if not any language)? I just don't understand... Searching a product in a language that is not your own is already a pain, but combined with this terrible search and category navigation makes me quit every time without buying online. Please consider to enable language selection. | Great app, but buggy when making payments. Usually I browse in the app and make payments on the webpage, but the browsing experience is great! | Obtaining refund is a torturing experience. Customer care team is ruthless. | I love Ikea and app | The app is best | Others : 😊😊 But me : scp 3008💀💀 Americans : scp 3008 ☠️☠️☠️☠️ don't know what I'm talking about go to YouTube and type ikea scp 3008 | It's ikea | I don't understand the stupid solution to lock one language for one region. So I have no ability to use an application with a language that I can understand. And the system language is English, so I'm sure that app supports it. And why, for Japan (for example) app supports manual language choice but for some EU countries no? Why you just can't unlock manual language choice for all regions? | Disappointing when there is no signal in IKEA and wifi is a speed of a dial up connection. You provide an app but takes several minutes to open using the guest wifi signal in store. 4G signal is of no existence in store!! | Love it | App is easy to search for products and is very intuitive. | Poor, it needs way more work before the app went live! Have you even pentest done?! The app looks dodgy because it doesn't work. | Great with English support in Sweden | Works well and has lots of useful features | Update: 03-11-2024 The issue appears to have been fixed hence, amended the rating. When attempting to Sign In with e-mail or mobile number, keep getting a notification stating I'm a bot ? Something went wrong., Unable to sign-in.. | Major issues with checkout when it does not work and you cannot leave the store. Uninstalled, installed again and again. :( Otherwise it's ok | Very beautiful product | ich kann nicht registieren. bitte fixieren den Bug sofort | this app collects all your personal data. instead of offering convenience for the shopper, it is aiming to make things convenient for the business instead. without offering personal details such as birthday information, it won't let you register. you need to scan your all of your items prior to coming to the checkout. scanning device doesn't work half of the time. after all the effort, and having account with your address details, the checkout machines still ask you to enter your postcode. | Good | Great app really smooth interface Love the ability to see what things look like in my room | I miss the planning tools that only seem to exist in the browser | Disappointed | It would be nice if I could pick English as the language despite living in Germany. | Very useful, especially convenient with the self-scan and pay, do not have to wait in line for so long at the check out, brilliant !! | Easy to find product and super fast for self scan and check out | So easy to shop using the app! I can create a list add items to it and then checkout for delivery or click and collect! Really easy and takes away the stress of navigating the whole store. | Very easy to use | Has some more convenient options that the web version. | IKEA items are very reasonable | Excellent and momentous shopping experience | Fabulous | Smart and flexible planning tool. Helps both to order online and to plan one's trip to the store. | Outstanding app | Love the app easy to find items. I like how i can check an item is in stock before i go to the store | Easy to use. I've had no issues with crashes. | I would like to share 3 experience here. 1. The app little confusing to shop any product. 2. Offline at Turbhe, they have amazing place to shop but the Citi bank Ikea credit card keep disturbing and promise you free and discount plz don't fall in the trap. They will not bother once docs and card applied 3 transport facility - I had booked on Sunday and the items delivered after 5 days for 15 kms delivery. They keep telling line up not happened and Viwandi go down mein chala gaya ( stupid one) | Remove | Super easy shopping from the app!! Everything right at your fingertips and no walking around forever in the wearhouse!!! WIN + WIN | No me deja loguearme. | What's wrong with having a standard option to put the room size in and the allow you to populate the items in the room and move them around. The ar feature doesn't work for small rooms in my opinion, it's just a gimmick. | easy to use | Login doesn't work | Good experience | Good | Little different from generic UI we see in shopping apps. So little hard to use. | I felt like a kid in a candy store | Great store! Great stuff | Awesome loved 😍 | Aplicația nu este destul de ușor de folosit pentru mine. Mi-a cauzat timp pierdut și mulți nervi. Nu îmi place interfața prea luminoasă a aplicației. Standardul în 2024 este o interfață întunecată. | Easy | Very helpful app to find items you want in stores. | ❤️ | Bezużyteczna przy słabym połączeniu internetowym. Nie wychodzi poza ekran startowy. Wszystkie inne aplikacje działają | Accurate, easy to find items, and a very simple interface. Not unlike IKEA itself. Good job. | Amazing app very useful | Online shopping need more advance. | Nelze se přihlásit, při zadání hesla jsem vyhodnocen jako bot a zaslání jednorázového kódu nefunguje. | 👍 | Easy to navigate, find and save items. | Vaatii VPN yhteyden poistamista jotta voi kirjautua. Huono ratkaisu | Changing region forces the app language to change. So don't move to a new county or the app is worthless ig. | Shopping is easy and fun | Odlicno radi, lak pregled i naručivanje | Used to be great, but I can no longer login since the latest update. Now fixed as of 27/2/24 | All I see is a picture of a bed and a bouncing dot. I don't know where to click or what to do 🤷‍♀️ | Einkaufen bei IKEA ist eine schreckliche Erfahrung! Es wurden falsche Teile geliefert, jetzt warte ich seit mehr als 2 Wochen auf die Lieferung der richtigen Teile, aber der Kundenservice war nutzlos, sie entschuldigen sich nur und verschieben das Problem auf nächste Woche. sie helfen nicht. Ich werde nie wieder etwas bei IKEA kaufen und rate jedem davon ab, etwas zu kaufen, wenn ihm seine Zeit und sein Seelenfrieden wichtig sind. | Love IKEA - just evaluate what you are purchasing and for what environment | easy to use and very convenient | Great information on products | The app doesn't load so it's useless. The issues started around the end of last year and have only been getting worse. | Wanted to favourite an item, clicked create new list, had to restart the app completely for the list to show up. And then it was empty, didn't even contain the item I wanted. | Never get a barcode after paying. I always have to open my email, find the receipt among 12 attachments, open it, zoom in on the barcode in the attachment and then I can get through the gates. Debatable if it is a time-saver or not. | Awesome | Great App! My favorite app/store for all my housing needs and wants. | Can't log in. It says something went wrong and tap the 3 dots to go to the app and there are no dots. Go back to the app to log in and the same thing happens. | Love ikea and the app makes shopping so much easier | 🖤🖤🖤 | Den enda delen jag var intresserad av, att planera ett rum, fungerar inte på enheten. Istället får man en länk som leder till webbsidan som säger att man ska använda appen. | Has everything you need in a doing app and works. Search for items, see stock levels, quick checkout, shopping list, online purchasing. | Easy to use, clear info on products, similar products, paying and delivering models | I installed this application because I want to renovate my room and I thought it would be the best option. And it really is! ❤️And the 3D option is so cool😃 | Great app, works fast, can use to scan items while shopping then pay quickly | Not working properly in android notepad | Tad bit laggy but overall love the app | The load times are so slow. I looked up what I wanted on the website, scrolled through all the options and returned to the app and it was still loading. | Cannot log in.... | Good price, friendly staff. | Love it | Excellent app with all the relevant product details. The page loading is a bit slow even with faster internet, the interface experience could be made smoother... | It works as intended. | Easy to use, scan in store and add to cart is awesome. Also, it's ikea. | Love it! | Very good furniture at good prices | Yo why did nobody tell me how to exit ikea yall I been wandering these yellow rooms for hours rn I'm boutta go cray cray ong I ain't never goin to ikea again 😭😭🙏🙏🙏 | Most of the products are unavailable. | Ikea always excellent | Great options.

Co asi tak mám na emailu prokazovat a proč s dokladem na pobočce? | Vše funguje jak má. | Absolutely nothing works | Booking is fine, but the Login option is very bad. You can only login with an actual ticket (not with a past one) or with Regiojet Pay. So if you have none, you simply cannot login, cannot see your own account, credit etc. It should be possible to login with a user account. | For Me It was a very wonderful trip, Serve was good and on time. One extra star for them for the commitment because I forgot my luggage in the bus so i write an email they called me within 2 minutes and told me they found it in the bus and after 2 hours they delivered me the luggage on the same station were i waa told to stand.... Thank you so much... | Does not start at all. | Seriously not giving an updated info about delay. At some point, the schedule suddenly gone when the delay is more than two hours. It would be nice if they keep updating it especially for travellers who doesn't know any local languages. Eventually, for successing delays, the train didn't arrive. Not even a single notice. | People in the train put them large baggage on the top shelfs and staf doesn't nothing with this... It is not safety for people around this baggage | Only option how to ""order"" service in train. Not working... Tragic | Po pěti minutách od instalace této aplikace jsem zjistil, že se jedná o špatnou aplikaci 👎🏼. Například v notifikační liště se mi zobrazuje, že vlak 🚆 je v polovině své trasy avšak vlak ani nepřijel do mé výchozí stanice 🤦‍♂️. Nebo to telefon probouzí snad každých 10 sekund nebo mne to během používání aplikace bezdůvodně odhlásí a je potřeba se znovu přihlásit, atd... | Placení přes telefon pořád nejde. Udělejte s tím neco, prosím. | Doesn't support Google Wallet | Keeps crashing | Why cannot person login via Google, Apple or Facebook in 2023? I need to put some ticket number and password that I don't even know..... Very bad experience.... | Used this in middle Europe with ease and found it very useful | I don't understand why there isn't an option to order the free refreshments on the tablet itself. Maybe not the paid once, because of security but there is zero reason not to do it for the coffee/tea. I do not want to download and figure out a new app and log-in details,... for the sole purpose of ordering free beverage that was advertised. I believe most people would not even bother because this is kinda ridiculous. | Disaster of app or i would say service, i pay some extra for coffee abd the app was not working, the guy which was serving told me we are arriving in 40 min. Lol i want to spend my money and buy water! | I booked 2 seats next to each other (for me & my mom). They changed the type of the carriage, which would've been okay, but they also changed our seats, one was number 34, the other 91. The app itself works fine. I will probably choose different means of transportation next time, or at least different provider. | The quality of service and app functionality is constantly degrading. | Každou chvíli timeout. Nemohu dobít kredit z aplikace ani se přihlásit na webu. | Tehy provide good service, prices are fair and lets you cancel your ticket with full refund until 15 mins before the trip. This has changed with its competitors. And compare to them, Regiojet offers more comfortable trips at better prices. Of course there are also some small issues like internet is not working well and the driver/assistant might not be always very friendly but these issues exist in most tranportation companies throughout Europe. So, I give 5 out 5 for this Czech Student company | proc nepisere v apce platformu vlaku? to asi bude nejaka vesmirna zahada... | Vynikajici service ,ridic pomahal s kuframa nalozit I vylozit.. Diky | Search not working | The only reason I had the app was for the refreshments. For at least six months this feature has not been working for me. In the refreshments tab it simply never loads the seat I have reserved so I can't really order. | I bought ticket to one seat, but it was changed to another one, not same quality. No booked seats from application, super cool. It is better to buy regular ticket than in application, because they would not change it. | After last update, shortly after start, I see nothing just yellow screen. Even more useless app than before. | Nejen že aplikace není moc použitelná když na většině delších tratí není pokrytí internetem. Ale navíc neustále vyhazuje chybu spojenou s počtem requestu. Výsledek je aplikace úplně k ničemu. | It just doesn't work during the trip, it's constantly logging me out, just not possible to order refreshments | Never use the services of these company. Multiple times they cancelled our wagon without compensation! | I was take the train from vilklosony to Praha and the bavarge order in app not work like most of time and they say that work by order in person but they say wait 1 or 2 Hours to make 1 order. That's really so bad experience for me | Aplikace je velmi pomalá, zasekana. Během chvilky vám rozpálí mobil a spotřebuje celou baterií. Mně se dokonce mobil přehrál a sám vypnul. Služby společnosti v aplikaci jsou ale překvapivě ještě horší. Vlak, kterým jsem měl v 8 ráno odjet mi den předem v 8 večer zrušili. Nedočkal jsem se náhradního spoje ani žádné jine kompenzace. Podle přepravních podmínek máte možnost místa na stání, to však nikdo nenabídne a ani to není možné. Arogantní přístup zralý až na COI. | Fraud, you should rather buy your snacks/drinks in the store. Got charged but didn't get what I payed for. | Horrible experience with password reset. | Aplikácia je čistá lotéria, ale myslím, že v rulete mám vyššie šance na úspech. | Po pokusu o koupení lístku se zobrazí jen bílá stránka. EDIT: Opraveno | Pres aplikaci si nemuzu objednat zadne jidlo, nic nenabizi, aplikace zkratka nefunguje. Na upozorneni stewardky mi bylo doporuceno si objednat jidlo pres nekoho jineho komu aplikace funguje | Cannot paste password for the login. Does not support MFA / 2FA. Please update your app to 2023 standards... | Nefunguje pridanie lístka, obtiažna a zbytocna registrácia | Самая конченная компания, если вам не жалко своих нервов то можете воспользоваться это отсталой гнилой конторой. Меняют места как хотят, отменяют вообще билеты. Не советую, не рекомендую. Обходите это г... десятой дорогой | The app is broken most of the times. | What a stupid app. We entered our ticket number that showed on our ticket but the app said it's a wrong ticket number. We couldn't ordered food on the train. We were starving. The food only was ordered through the app. | Táto aplikácia vo mne už dlhodobo vyvoláva pri používaní čistú frustráciu a dneska to bohužiaľ vyvrcholilo týmto hodnotením. 10 pokusov objednať si kávu vo vlaku prekladaných generickými error hláškami, samovoľným odhlásením z aplikácie, ďalšími error hláškami, neresponzívnym UI. Bol som tak rád, že sa mi konečne podarilo pridať item do košíka a skončilo to aj tak ďalšou chybou (surprise surprise - znova generickou) pri objednávaní. Prosím prepíšte to. Tento paskvil sa nedá nazvať aplikáciou. | This was the first time (and hopefully the last time) i had to install an app to buy a snack. Having to figure out password for the account used to but a ticket to get a Kofola is not a good idea. Mostly useless, everything the app does either already is a web page or could have been a web page. Does not work when internet connection drops out during the train trip, i have lost the log in when this happened. In summary: boooooo | obcerstvenie je problematicke a temer nikdy nefunguje(dajte si to uz pls dokopy) | Ita a dissapointment how often the app doesnt work because of ""maintenance"". You cant search tickets. You cant pay. Payments options dont show. Payments crash and then tickets are cancelled without notice. It just doesnt work. Also app randomly signs out, and you cant log in with other option than ticket number or RegioPay. Would be real nice to be able to register via third party e.c. Google account. Please fix this app. | Doesn't work | 1) Během rezervace sedadla by bylo fajn vidět, zda-li někdo v mém okolí cestuje se psem (pro alergiky). 2) Notifikace o probíhající jízdě se aktualizuje dost často a předpokládám, že bude mít neblahý vliv na baterii. Zároveň má hádám velkou prioritu a často vyskakuje jako nová notifikace na zamknutém zařízení. Bylo by fajn mít separátní channel pro notifikaci o odjezdu a notifikaci o probíhající jízdě (tu bych si rád vypnul). | Dala bych nula hvezdicek, kdyby to slo. Opakovane instaluju, abych si objednala jidlo, ale to proste neni mozne! Catering je nedostupny... nechapu. | It's a terrible app | Great!!! | RegioJetem jezdím docela často a aplikace ti opravdu kazí. Systém objednávek prostě nefunguje spolehlivě - objednávky evidentně stevardům chodí pozdě, nebo vůbec; často není možné objednávku zaplatit ani kreditem, natož pak platební kartou; To že nešlo zaplatit člověk nepozná, protože aplikace neupozorní ani na úspěšnou ani neúspěšnou platbu; Při sebemenším problému s připojením celý systém nereaguje; jestli po zaplacení opravdu jídlo přijde je taky někdy loterie ... i ČD tyto základy zvládá | Quite user-unfriendly mess. Czech national railways have a much better and more reliable app that provides more info. The worst issue for me is that in case when your train is running with a delay, it still vanishes from the connections section at the planned time of arrival! So after the scheduled arrival time, you can no longer watch your delay in the app and must rely on 3rd party train trackers to e.g. synchronize with people going to pick you up. You can't even re-book to a higher class! | The app is broken, there are so many reviews complaining, yet they do not fix it. They force the customer to use to app to order, yet they won't have a functioning app. What a stupid system. | Objednávanie občerstvenia nefunguje | Ordering food didn't work, tickets randomly disappear form app. It's frustrating and sad at the same time because last year it worked well. | When it works, it's fine. The problem is, it shows that there is a system maintenance most of the time (which to me seems like just a generic error message because sometimes restarting the app works). That is really convenient when you're trying to show your ticket to the bus driver 🙃 Ordering food on trains is also unreliable. | app is really hard to use and it allow you to order food without warning and then just cancel your order out of nowhere | What happened with my credit about 280 CZK, remaining????? | jednou kdyz jsem si zaplatil vlak z Brna na Videnske letiste, ale na Hbf ve Vidni vlak zastavil a az po nekolika minutach se personal obtezoval nam sdelit, ze ten vlak dal nepojede a ze si mame vystoupit, tak mi regiojet nejprve odmital vratit me penize za neuskutecnenou cestu Wien Hbf - Wien Flughafen. Nasledne kdyz mi je konecne formou kreditu vrátili, tak poté mi je, nez jsem kredit stihl využít, opet strhli. Doporučuji využít jiné dopravce. Regiojet je zlodejska spolecnost | Can't say it's toooo bad, but I've got lots of fun at once, during attempt to pay meal, got logout, had to reset password.. 3 times, also train was 30 minutes late, but it ask to rate before trip end :-D | App crashes constantly - troubles with payment for refreshments. Money is gone from the bank account but the app didn't register it - food never arrived. | Ordering of food and drinks didn't work during my trip from Bratislava to Prague and there was no restaurant wagon, so it was not possible to get anything, because the waiters had training sessions and were not available. Wifi was also not working. Toilet was overflowing and I witnessed a RegioJet employee yelling at one of the passengers and in front of other waiters who were in training. | Your train is delayed 2 hours? Well too bad, you can't order food because the app thinks your train ride is already over. | Opakované dlouhodobé výpadky serveru z důvodu ""údržby"" znemožňují vše od vyhledávání spojení až po přihlášení do aplikace. | absolutně nefungujea plikace ani web, kazdy den ma ta aplikace problém a nedokáže se na ni nic udělat. K tomu jsem za 10 minut 3x refreshnul stránku abyvh si mohl koupit jednu pitomou jízdenku a cena se zvedla 3x celkově o dvacet korun na lowcost. | It used to be a good app. But for like a month now I can't load up my tickets when I most need them because ""the app is under maintenance"" all the time. If you could do something about it like doing it sometime at night and not when people are traveling it'd be kindly appreciated. | They say I can order food/drinks ONLY from the app, but app says ""catering unavailable"". Other people can order, I am on a route that I am supposed to be able to order. Very bad experience. | The app is alright-ish, very often it keeps displaying ""connection error"". But the service on board has declined tremendously, from great to zero. They claim there is coffee in the bus, but often the self-service machine is simply not working | Nanhoria applikacia. Po registraci sa mi tam neda pridat ticket a jedlo si nemozem objednat. Najhorsia aplikacia v strednej europe | aktuálně je po otevření jenom bílá obrazovka. smazání cache nepomůže. no, tak s vama asi nepojedu no. | What's the point in creating an account with your email and password, if you cannot use those credentials later on to log in??? | In most of the time, the app doesn't work. It's really fascinating, how bad the app is, I think I don't know any other app, which works so little. | Great that Ui and navigation is intuitive. Things to improve: Critical: - System maintanace shouldn't happen or should happen at night, not when entering the bus. Medium: - When ticket is bought and added in tickets section it should disapear from cart section. - Application crash sometimes | V aplikaci už delší dobu nefunguje možnost objednávání občerstvení, i když je to jediný možný způsob, jak si ve vlaku objednat. Objednávky u stevardů totiž nejsou možné. Jezdím regiojetem často a tak jsem na tuto skutečnost už zvyklá. Avšak někoho, kdo často nejezdí a spoléhá na občerstvení ve vlaku, to může nemile zaskočit. Otázkou je, proč tato chyba není napravena, protože podle komentářů zde nejsem jediná, komu objednávky nefungují. Dalším problémem je strašně dlouhé načítání platební brány. | Smutné, kéž by se přes to dalo něco objednat. | App has got much better, but the connectivity with the endpoint system is unreliable thus impacting user experience. There should be no ads in this app. | Allow people to cancel ticket when the train is delayed by 15 minutes or more. You say ""15 minut before departure"" not ""15 minutes before PLANNED departure"" | Sometimes it works, sometimes totally not. | I read many negative feedback I'm surprised because the app working very fast and very amazing service.afterall very affordable price in Europe 🌍 My next journey soon ☺️ With regiojet | The worst app I have ever seen. 500 chars allowed here is not enough for describing all the things that are wrong with this app. | Jediny sposob jak objednat jedlo vo vasich vlakoch. Tesim sa z toho ze vas vysachovali zo slovenskeho trhu a dufam ze skrachujete aj v cechach | Aplikace každou chvíli nefunguje, někdy nejdou zaplatit jízdenky a objednávka občerstvení mi nenabíhá ani v jednom zen2 telefonů. | Not working. Neither is website | Half of the things doesn't work, you can't log into your account and food ordered via app takes forever till it comes to you. | Asi kvuli kolisavemu pripojeni jsem ztratil 15min instalovanim appky a objednavanim jidla, ale nakonec jsme stejne hladovy a personal me odpalkoval, ze jidlo si jinak kpupit nemuzu:-( | Can't find Prague or Brno as stations after the update. | ""You have no active tickets for which refreshments are available."" This is how I ended up being able to order NOTHING in the course of my WHOLE journey. | Perfect ❤️ | Logs you out, and give incorrect password error even if password is correct | Slow, lot of bugs ... | Nespolahliva aplikacia. Najhorsie je, zd sa cez nu neda objednat catering, na ktory sa clovek spolieha. | Ani po letech vývoj nejsou schopni zajistit chod serveru. Aplikace se při problémech s připojením nechová korektně. Vývoj se nehýbe. | Samovolně odhlašuje | Jednou za čas zkouším, jak se aplikace posunula... Bohužel po pár minutách se pokaždé ****** a sahám po počítači. Nechápu, jak může RJ použití aplikace takové ""kvality"" vynucovat! | the last update made the app unusable, I cant even select a seat... how is this even a thing for a company this big... the last time I used your services you didnt even get us to our destination... is this how you are improving your services now? | Zbytecna aplikace. Vyvojari by meli vratit naklady Regiojetu za tak odflaklou aplikaci. K veci: 2 hodiny nelze objednat jidlo. Potom jde, aplikace se zasekne pri placi aby pri refreshnuti vam ukazala, ze 40 minut pred prijezdem nelze jidlo objednat - k tomu navic aplikace nepripocte zpozdeni, i kdyz aplikace o nem vi. Absolutne zbytecne. | Super aplikácia, lístky, jedlo, cestovné poriadky, všetko v jednom. Mohli by ste prosím pridať objednávanie jedla online, aj pre iné triedy? | Jízda je delší než 40 min, asi hodinu a 5 min, a stejně nejde nic objednat z jídla, protože vlak má 20 min zpoždění, aplikace stále počítá s původním časem příjezdu a objednání se pouští az nějaký čas po odjezdu. Komedie. | Very rarely get served refreshments as they only usually have one person serving the whole train, even though you buy a ticket that offers refreshments. | Unusable, legit one of the worst apps I've ever seen. | Schedules are not loading or it took too much time. And so on... | Při zapnutí jen bílá obrazovka | Aplikace funguje jak má, líbí se mi možnost, že mohu stornovat jízdenku 15 minut před odjezdem. Dobíjení kreditu je jediný problém této aplikace, než se kredity dobíjí trvá to tak 5 minut než se to zobrazí v aplikaci. Tuto aplikaci používám na telefonech, které jsou tak 2 roky staré a na nich to funguje. | This is bug and crash simulator not real application. I was unable to get anything done due to constant crashes and errors. Good job regiojet | Hrozná aplikácia. Jediný dôvod, prečo som si ju stiahol, bolo objednanie občerstvenia. Podľa aplikácie som nemal žiadny platny lístok, a to napriek tomu, že ma steward skontroloval 5 minút dozadu. | The application is slow and buggy. It is better to use RegioJet web instead this app. The web is perfectly fast and everything is working. | Fradulent app! Will pretend to sell you tickets then a different bus with completely different services and brand will take you! | Does not load - only shows white screen. Before that, it was progressively decaying with each update. | Bugs, login page loading too long, outages when ordering and the staff seems to have a real struggles with the orders since it takes much more time than before and the sequence of orders really differentiate. | Nic nefunguje. Už hodinu se snažím objednat kávu, ale z technických důvodů to nejde. A našlo do té doby, kdy už nešlo objednat z důvodu, že by se nestihla příprava do příjezdu do cílové stanice... | IT WAS HORRIBLE! NEVER AGAIN! | I can't use my credit card to buy food on board | Spokojenost, bez problemu funguje. | Very bad experience with this apps It shows us wrong dates of reservation ???? | Helpful, fast, and reliable | One of the worst apps I've ever seen .. bugs everywhere, most time not all purchased tickets shown .. I've started using CD trains and flixbus buses as at least there apps work | Interesting | You can find a surprising amount of info in the app but it is really unintuitive. Half the time it doesn't even show you the tickets and you have to refresh several times to eventually get them. I really don't want to make comparisons between this and the ČD app for example, but they could take some inspiration... edit: For the past few months I have to keep reinstalling the app because it just randomly decides to stop loading anything past the logo. | Often bugs but what is way worse is the train travel itself. It is a new standard that we never leave on time - ""normal"" delay is about 20-40 minutes before we even leave the station... | Excellent App | Booking travel from Prague to Bratislava and from Vienna to Prague was so easy. I am impressed with RegioJet as a company too. The British rail companies could learn a thing or two. | Absolutně nechápu, jak si společnost velikosti Student Agency/RegioJet může dovolit vypustit do produkce aplikaci, ve které funguje polovina funkcí. Tragédie. Regio nikdy víc. | Very bad company and very unprofessional personal. I really dont recommend it | Občas je potřeba aplikaci restartovat, aby se ukázaly objednané jízdenky. Bylo by příjemné, kdyby se informace o tom, že jízdenka je na posilový spoj, zobrazovala už v náhledu jízdenky a ne až po rozbalení detailu. | The worst website and app ever. I am not able to buy tickets for several days and they do not even reply my messages in support. They do not manage who and when buy their tickets and neglext their customers. Wors service, worst trains. Zero. | I'd give -10 if I could. Items are sold out, app never loads or crashes, doesn't let you pay or you end up paying twice... It's been months, and there is ALWAYS something wrong with this system. Now I'm stuck in a train with a 2h delay and I can't order anything because I should have arrived already, and my ticket is no longer valid - absolute disaster of a system 🙃 | Aplikace ukazuje ze je volne misto (pritom to same spojeni vyhledane.na webu je vyprodane) a potom na poslednim kroku hodi error Nelze pridat do kosiku. Po zaplaceni obcerstveni mi apka pise ze nebylo zaplaceno ( nasteti prisel email ze jse ok). | Veľmi oceňujem nový systém objednávania občerstvenia zohľadňujúci aktuálny stav zásob. Sklamala notifikácia, v ktorej čas príjazdu nezohľadňuje meškanie. Ikona upozornenia v stavovej lište je príliš malá, logotyp mohol byť väčší, ľudia, čo nemajú perfektný zrak (alebo hidpi displej) to určite nerozoznajú. Ikony rýchlych skratiek pri podržaní ikony aplikácie majú pri tmavom režime slabý kontrast a nemajú konzistentný vzhľad. Tmavá téma v aplikácii by sa tiež mohla nastaviť zo systému. | Hovadina | Úžasná reakce. Odinstalováno. // 9.6.: Bez reakce. Odinstalovat. // 31.5.: 1. Nutnost objednat si občerstvení přes aplikaci - tedy přes internet - na trati, která má místa bez signálu, to je super kúl vychytávka. 2. Přestože mám povoleny notifikace jen pro ""Možnost o jednávky občerstvení"", otravuje to každou chvíli s nějakým přehledem průběhu jízdy. Achjo. | Zpožděný vlak zmizel ze seznamu zpoždění dřív, než přijel do stanice, tak není možné najít správné nástupiště, objednat si občerstvení v aplikaci trvá 30 minut, nefunguje dokud se nepripojite na jejich WiFi a s její rychlosti trvala jen samotná platba 15 minut, než se načetla. Přesně podle Murphyho, co se pokazit může se pokazí, co nemůže se pokazí taky. | Your app is very slow and also it cannot load any city. The search bar just stays empty. I tried reinstalling the app, and it doesn't work. What a shame | Was an excellent app, however currently I have issues with searching for connections. Only blank white screen opens. Fortunately, at least the web page interface works. | It was great when it worked. But now a black screen appears whenever I do a search | Garbage. Edit: 2 years have passed since my initial review and the app is worse than I remember. | Buying ticket does not work. | White screen when trying to make a search :( | Dlouhodobě strašlivá aplikace, zbytečné klikací kroky po zaplacení (pro které musím do bankovní aplikace na 2FA), kvůli kterým jsem nejednou nastoupil do vlaku bez jízdenky ale s nabitým kreditem... Objednávání jídla mě jednou stálo stovku a do systému obsluhy žádná objednávka nepřišla. Od update 23.5. po vyhledání spoje appka prostě zamrzne s bílou obrazovkou a je potřeba ji vypnout. Nepoužitelné, nerozumím, jak někdo takový produkt může poslat do světa. | Breaks, doesn't load, crashes... used to be good tho | Terrible experience I was going back from Vienna to Prague and they don't give any information about where to find it so I missed it and lost my money never again 👎 | Not working at all. So you gonna stay hungry and you can't do nothing about it! | Apka přestala vyhledávat, zobrazí je jen bila stránka a jediné, co lze udělat, je apku ukončit. I před touto chybkou rozhodně nejde o žádný zázrak, bylo by to tak za 3 hvězdičky. Kdybych do hodnocení zahrnul i samotnou ""offline"" službu, bylo by to horší. Služba se za poslední dobu výrazně zhoršila. | Utter rubbish .. be VERY careful .. if you change timezones, your previously book tickets all change to reflect new timezone, even if they are for travel in old timezone .. App written by utter idiots!!! .. Also many journey are not point to point and have hidden stops and delays .. this company should be closed down!!! | Tak ako viacero komentarov predo mnou...bud appka pise, ze sa neda z technickych pricin objednavat alebo su vsetky polozky vypredane. Stewardky nikde, po vyse dvoch hodinach cesty sa ludia nemaju ako dostat k obcerstveniu 🤷🏼‍♂️ Mame vodu 👍🏻 | I always used this app to book my train from Prague when I return from UK but recently all your timetable when you booking from uk are 1 hour (UK time) behind which doesn't make sence when you try to book train from czech city, only relized this because of you confirmation email....(ei. Trin from Prague at 14.20 shows as train at 13.20??🤔). Maybe something to look at when you do your next update.... | I rate this app at 1 🌟 just because there is no lower option (otherwise I would have rated it at -5 🌟) Completely agree with one of the previous review - this app is useless, completely user not friendly, unnecessary complicated, poor options... Avoid, avoid avoid! | besides the constant delays of the trains and failure stops every hour of the ride, the app doesn't work correctly. The credit I transferred in the app couldn't be used to buy anything. The staff did not know to fix it. | Login wasn't possible, therefore unable to obtain any refreshments during a 5+ hour journey. | Ordering food doesnt work, service here is overworked and they have hard time resolving unexpected situations, take your own food. The app has many bugs , useless.. | Terrible app, nothin is workin properly | crush.. but still smh good. -1 star for incorrect internal timers (when attempting to purchase refreshments it was still 5 minutes before 30 till arrival and the option to purchase them was disabled, the counter also does not take into the account delay!) Very unreliable... | The app feels like pre-alpha to me. I almost starved trying to order refreshments using it. | V poslední době to jde teda hodně dolů. Někdy se aplikace nenačte vůbec, možná je to údržba, což by se dalo chápat, ale to člověk nikde nezjistí, protože na Fb RegioJet nic není. | You can not delete account or change currency 👎 | The idea is great. But the fact that the wifi on the train doesn't properly work most of the train ride ruins the whole concept. Why, just why do I have to use my (unreliable) data to order food when the person responsible is walking past me? | Works fine. I could log in using the number of my ticket, and also order food. The payment went OK, they brought the food in 30 minutes. I like that the app displays how much of which food is available. | Just Perfect. The customer service is a 10/10. When I couldn't find the bus stop in Amsterdam they helped me until the end and the driver was also very patient and friendly. Thank you 😊👏. You guys made my day as I have a long trip ahead🤩 | VÝBĚR SEDADLA PODLE PLÁNKU vs. REALITA: vybírám si sedadlo ve směru jízdy u okna na pravé straně vlaku. Bližší dveře jsou dál od rušně. Nastupuji do vlaku, žádná mimořádnost, a musím projít celým vagonem dopředu a sedím na levé straně vagónu zády do směru jízdy. Koukám do aplikace. Prý sedím vpravo vzadu, ve skutečnosti vlevo vepředu. Děje se to opakovaně na různých tratích. Objednávání občerstvení a nápojů je tak (ne)funkční, že si raději kafe vezmu z čekárny RJ. Opravte prosím v aplikaci. | This app just doesn't work. There has probably been no debugging and pressure to make it work whatsoever. I have used it for like 5 minutes just trying to find my train and look up the prices of tickets and I have already experienced like 4 bugs that happened. Extremly uncomfortable to use. | no possibility to sign in with my Regiojet account | Any attempt to top up credit through the app ends up with some HTML error code so I need to log in through browser to add money / buy ticket. The app doesn't update with departure delays so its already telling me when is the expected arrival even though I haven't left yet. Needs improvement! | Zaplatit za objednávku jídla je naprosto nemožné. Dvakrát jsem skončil na verifikaci, potřetí už to neprošlo ani přes tlačítko zaplatit. Karta ČS. Třešnička nakonec - ""nelze objednat 30min před koncem jízdy"" | Nefunkcna platba kartou (odskusane VISA Tatrabanka, VUB). Nefunkcne doplnenie kreditu cez kartu a ani cez rychly bankovy prevod. Jedlo si neviem objednat tympadom. | Doesn't work properly. I can't see any use for the app since I can't pay for tickets there and I can't open an existing ticket there. Also the train search is intermittent and sometimes just won't work.. What's the point of having an app that does nothing right? | The new notification and refreshment ordering is amazing. So much better then the previous experience. | Trains are good, but this app is a real trash. | Link to payments not working, the first generation worked well, this one sucks on so many levels | I ordered a dish then they made me wait 1,5 hour. When I asked it turned out my payment was stuck in the system. The steward made me pay for it one more time and promised he would ask the responsible ones to return my money... that never happened.

Dneska je páték, tak zase dělají všechno pro prodloužení těch fakturaci a získání více peněz od zákazníka kterému fyzické nejsou schopny poskytnout žádné služby. | I don't know why company, which makes a tons of money, can't do a better app, which wouldn't be always lagging. | Bad service and weak signal in czech Republic | Vyřizovat cokoliv v této aplikaci je za trest. Z formuláře není vidět pomalu na políčko co chce člověk vyplnit. Neustálá propagace chatbota. | Hrozná aplikace. Pomalá, většina funkcionality se stejně spouští v prohlížeči, a hlavně: Pravidelně se sama odhlásí. | This is basically a glorified web browser for Vodafone only, but also slower and clunkier. It's really sad how supposedly big companies just don't care about the UX at all. | Excellent service. I am satisfied with the quality and service. | I can't believe.. How bad is this app... Doesn't Vodafone have any money for normal team to make at least user friendly app? It takes a few years... Bad... I gave to use Web app to pay the bills.. I've been using Vodafone since 1996.... | Tohle je odstrašující příklad toho, jak interface nemá vypadat. Vše je nepřehledné, nelogické a otravné. Po zapnutí se zobrazí přehled všech služeb. Po rozkliknutí čehokoliv se již nelze k přehledu předvídatelným způsobem vrátit... Navíc aplikace pořád otravuje s cookies a zobrazuje další dialogy... Nelogicky zabírá čtvrtinu displeje obrovským polem ""sdělte nám svůj kontaktní e-mail"" v situaci, kdy Vodafone můj kontaktní e-mail má... Rád bych viděl duševní pochody lidí, kteří toto stvořili... | Horrible app not remembering your login, also unable to login or change password. | Etjs | Super | Místo pořádné funkcionality pro práci s účtem a nastavení se jedná o obrázkovou aplikaci, která dělá místo reklamě | Can't pay my bill, because it says there is problem with the card (there isn't). It doesn't even have my card registered, how am I supposed to pay the bill? | Useless | Opět se nejde přihlásit. Aplikace je totální odpad. Naprosto nefunkční. Nemůžu ani normálně zaplatit tarif protože 99% času aplikace prostě nejde. Stačí už jen kousek od toho abych přešel k někomu jinému | 0/5 app is broken | This is the worst My Vodafone app I have used!! To this point I used 3 different My Vodafone apps, this is just beyond horrible! First, even when you change settings to English, nearly everything stays in Czech. Second, nothing opens, app crashes or freezes frequently. I am questioning whether they let a 5 year old make this app for them. | Infinite loading times even with the best internet connection, crashes a lot. No update til now has made it any better. I use it only if I really don't have access to a PC, otherwise would uninstall it immediately. | Asi nejhorší zákaznická podpora. Slabej signál a data jsou drahý. Nedoporučuju. Běžte k t-mobile nebo O2 a uděláte nejlíp. | Worst app ever. As a foreigner, it has zero explanation. I feel like throwing my phone everytime i open this app. | Invoice payment from the app Is not working | Když chci změnit datastrop vždy dlouho hledám v aplikaci než to najdu. Proč není přímo na jeden klik? | Perfect | Otřesená aplikace, která je konstantě nefunkční a místo aby to provedlo platbou 1 tak to proběhlo 2x.... Nesnáším Vodafone | Extemely slow | Useful but extremely slow even on a fast net... Some pages take ages to load and then tell you the service is unavailable but you can get to the same data on web without a problem... What I really like is that you can pay your bill through it quite easily and without issues. | Tohle je opravdová srágora - aplikaci s horším ovládáním jsem už dloho neviděl... | I'm ok with the app | Proč nenecháte udělat UI a strom menu člověka, který to umí? Žádné z tlačítek vůbec nedělá to, co čeká! To je srandovní, když chceš vrátit se na domovskou stránku, zmáčkneš uprostřed, něco vyjede, tak zmáčkneš levé, furt něco vyjede! To je boží tak špatně udělat intuitivní ovládání 😂 | If you need to do rilevant changes to you profile app redirect you to webpage(again login etc), so for what is needed? Often you cannot download bill. It looks nice but not really useful | Nefunguje UI. Kliknout na nabídku účtu dole lze jen po přihlášení. Pak už ne. Hromada výkalů, která neprošla žádným testováním | Things take hours to get updated. 3 hours I'm trying to get an Esim activated while that useless Tobi stares at me with that stupid smile on his gimpy face.I hate Tobi so much. Edit: 4 hours in I still can't activate Esim cause the application WON'T show me! And yeah I still hate Tobi. Edit2:Omg the browser is even worse!!!And FU Tobi!! | Really bad, except a balance or a possibility to upgrade there is nothing else working. Can't even update my own personal details as email, returning me constantly to a main view. For a company of the size and wealth I would expect much better quality. | The worst UX i have experienced across all Vodafone contact points not just this app. ...dead ends, poor, incomplete explanations... I usually don't write reviews but this made me | Stupid and useless | V necem prehlednejsi nez T-Mobile, ale stale pomala a nedotazena aplikace. Vlastne jen prohlizec webove samoobsluhy. Po pridani noveho cisla pod ucet a pokusu a pojmenovani na me vyskoci schvaleni cookies a pak presmerovani na uvod. Pojmenovani cisla proto nefunguje. Widget se temer neaktualizuje a to ani manualne. | Neustále nefunguje, hází chyby. Tvrdí, že mám špatný formát emailu, i když se snažím přihlásit přes service number. To samé web. Za mě je to zásadní mínus. | Too many bugs. Very slow. Not user friendly at all ! Not helpful. Very confusing,buggy and slow. Both app and website. | Kdo vymyslel aby chat bot neustále vyskakoval a vše na obrazovce zakrýval? Kolikrát je potřeba zavřít? Testoval to vůbec někdo na mobilu se zobrazenou klávesnicí? Amatéři. | Where is Vodafone 5.9.0.  In my account there is the reminder to download it othervise there is no future for me. | Very Very good | Doesnt work | Ok | This is my second review. I lowered it from 3 to 1 star as I think that Vodafone had enough time to fix this slow buggy app. Moreover, it is full of webviews that works poorly and in lot's of cases returns errors without a way out. Vodafone should do a better job and this app is just disappointing. | Still the worst app existing. Submitted dozens of technical requests on the same issue, and they close those requests without resolution. | Difficult to navigate. | Vodafone je parta ochotniku. Padesat ruznych prihlasovacich udaju a obnovit nejde nic | I cannot login because of wrong format number, but what is wrong didn't specify. Cannot change language. In web page it's much easier. I can't use this app because of login | A lot of bugs, not stable. | Další aktivní služby -> změna aktivních služeb NEFUNGUJe. Jen to hodí do stejného menu, není možné nic změnit. Lol. A to jsem si myslel že jste aplikaci od vydání už aspoň trošku zprovoznili. Ještě že jsem primárně u Kaktusu a ne u vás.. | This is a nightmare | Opravdu hnus. Sorry, ale tohle se fakt nedá. Nic tak strašného jsem od Vodafone nečekal. Pomalé, hnusné, neintuitivni. Mam ještě t-mobile a teda nebe a dudy to vám povím. Očividně to nevidím jen já ty recenze tu jsou vesměs podobné. Zajímavé, že pořád vychází aktualizace aplikace ale nějake zlepšení opravdu nevidím. Ještě že tu nemám od vás hlasový tarif (jen internet doma) jako přítelkyně. Ta je z té vaší aplikace absolutně nešťastná. | Slow, annoying, takes forever to load, always asks for a fresh login. Works for keeping track of mobile data but the experience is painful. | Nelze využívat Vodafone TV na nezabezpečené zařízení. Co? Ne funguje to | The app is bad.. Really bad. Account system and account recovery system are the worst part of it.. Fix it please | Does what I need it for. | Performance wise, it's unusable, laggy and really bad. Functionality might be ok (logging is sometimes weird), bud the performance is so terrible it basically prevents usage of the app | Worst app I've ever used. I'm a programmer myself, so I hope everyone who worked on that app will get fired. | Login does not work, app is useless. | Ja som prešiel od Tesco Mobile a som šokovaný 😱 strašnou kvalitou, nefunkčnosťou, velmi pomalou odozvou, chýbajúcimi funkciami, hrozným dizajnom... Táto appka je naozaj veľmi veľmi zle navrhnutá aj implementovaná. Príklad pre ostatné operátory ako veci nerobiť. Neviem pochopiť, ako mohol Vodafone niečo také vôbec vypustiť (alebo vôbec niekto). Hrôza. Ak ostatné služby sú tiež podobné musím od nich rýchlo preč. EDIT: ""že to může být jen o zvyku""? Zvykať si na hrôzu🤦‍♂ Čítajte hodnotenia... | Thanks for fixing the blank Top Up screen. | Terrible app, bottom menu is not working, tapping on different buttons dont work | Jako ux na nule, to dlouhy nacitani pr kazdem kliku? Spatny, hosi, spatny. | Could be better. When you set the language to English, some parts of the app still remain in Czech | Terrible | Po aktualizaci s vizuální změnou naprostá katastrofa. Odporný layout, navigace aplikací nepřehledná. Widget neaktualizuje údaje - ukazuje že zbývá 7.9/8GB ale v aplikaci je že zbývá 2.9/8GB. | Awful to | Very slow and confused | Some options are links on main Vodafone site. It's a bad UI practice. It's difficult to find chat with support | Can't even top up my phone | Slow, almost unusable. | Not intuitive, helpless. It doesn't help to set all settings fast and correctly. You have to call helpdesk. I guess, the main idea to creat this App was: ""the general marketing purpose to sell more products"", but not the UI and UX friendliness. | Can't even log in with a prepaid card. Perfectly useless. | Payment feature is not useful: asking for mobile number and amount when you already have this info in the app? what about gpay which is already on my mobile? I am exUPC internet client and still not able to pay my internet bill through this app.","{""1"":14411,""2"":3201,""3"":3211,""4"":5408,""5"":22868}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"4.4","4.4","VARY","Vodafone Czech Republic a.s.","Vodafone+Czech+Republic+a.s.","aplikace@vodafone.cz","http://www.vodafone.cz","Vodafone CZ

This app is extremely slow at any connection speed. It is clunky and illogical when trying to navigate or find a function to perform a specific task. It is often switching back to czech language in the most important sub menus when English is unavailable. A lot of content still unavailable in English.

The most recent update made it harder to use - accounts don't automatically switch with home screen shortcuts, which is a function the app used to have.

Not happy 😏 | Give me more updates | Trash. | It's good sharing link's to Desktop but problematic when viewing at ""Desktop Mode"" with lot of tearing, and render errors like a big mess. -It doesn't have a lot of space in Home menu to add your Favorite links, just only 9 links... all this empty Space why I can't add more links? Also it's difficult to add links to home. -I really don't get the ""Focused"" background with the Big Microsoft logo on it. I just want a Black empty space to be focused, not a huge Logo. It really makes me angry. | Great browser 💖💖💖💖💯 | It is very helpful | Best App for my Android somehow! LoL! | For Win11.

Why introduce such a beneficial feature, acclimate users to it and then remove it. Its a shame | Much appreciated read aloud functionality | I just like | excellent experience | Dross offal | Edge performs well and adjust itself with such adament sites which wants to move with their own browser | No customization on android, cant hide co-pilot and no extensions still | free | Do you children in the tech industry who decide to make sweeping changes to established interface elements with no regard for usability and existing iconographic meaning just get together and schedule when you want to screw up multiple apps' design languages? You took away the number that shows how many tabs are open! You took a thing that had relevant information, and you made it worse. Also, it's an infuriating PITA that I have to wait for a toast notification to go away to use a page element. | Evertime you open it, it will ask you to permission to open an external app. From history . Even though its not required to open. I could not found a option to permit it to always open external apps. It show the same message again and again even I have ticked on ""remember my choice"" square ⬜. | My name is Fredrick Hoisington Jr. I am a single athletic male. I love my friends.

I call myself ""The Captain Of The Universe"" going fo my morning run. Cheers | When opening links, if edge is closed, new tabs go to the bottom. If it's running in the background, new tabs go to the top. There is no way to scroll to the bottom easily either. #enable-force-dark should be available from the shortcuts. | App is ok but i have problem with the news feeds as opposed to Google's inbuilt news feed. I'm living in Australia and right after installing this with my location turned on, i get no Australian news feed, all US political stuff...Trump and Biden all over the feed.

Once I find a fix 5 all day long | It's not working | I wish you could add open tabs customisation. It's hard to reach tabs when Im holding my phone with one hand. Also, there are many features missing from this mobile version compared to the PC version, which kind of disappoints me. | Microsoft shares your information even financial information with 3rd parties | I can't download this app it keeps failing. I can download other apps even bigger apps but this one won't install even though i had it installed before | Very good! | Very useful for work and research if you know how to be creative with the ai features. I subtracted one star because it uses a lot of power/data and gets slow if you try to do too much at one time. | Best search engine ever. It's so simplified and attractive to use | Working good for me anyway when I use it | Good | 🤫🧏 | Awsome | Cool | great platform | Browers great not sure why it would need 2gb of space tho | Was my favorite browser for years. Faster than chrome and never had any issues. An update on the last few months must have broken something. Takes forever to load, lags and regularly crashes. I really don't want to go through the process of switching browsers again but think I will have to. | Good | DEVIL'S FILM | I got a one start because this app don't install and not working | It sucks | Best browser so far | I would like a feature to place the url bar on the bottom of the screen (like firefox).

Also whatever u have downloaded, the file is lost. Boooom. one more,3) i just tried to clean the downloads history as it was loading too slow, & guess what, EDGE deleted all the downloaded files PERMANENTLY... what the hell is this goin on...? | they should hide the down bar | Very Good | Doesn't allow me to put bookmarks/favourites as ""new tab"" content. Even though the option is there. Also tries to force several different features on you, like their bing features and social media nonsense. Also deletes my saved tabs every few days.

The integration of AI without having to switch to another app is nice, can save me some searching and digging around in websites. The UI is pretty great as well, so for now it's my main browser."",""The browser is the same as others, the difference is that the functions it has in Edge are much more \""helpful\"" than other browsers, it is superior in terms of functions to any browser, but what irritates me is the difficulty of searching for an image, Google is far superior in this regard and any browser in fact, when you search for something and go to images, it's horrible how inferior it is to other browsers is. Disappointing, but I would never stop using just one suggestion to improve!"",""Sadly I am lowering the score of this app. It recently became very slow, and it was quietly draining the battery. Took me days to figure it out. It might be this AI nonsense... Original review on 22/11/2020 (5 stars): Good browser, it syncs well with the Microsoft account, which was what I needed. Even though it's based off the same engine that powers Chrome, MS Edge drains less battery. Navigation is fast, the UI is well-organised and I didn't have any problems since I've started using it."",""Here I go again, installed it again, but now on a new phone with much more internal memory plus the SD card. LOVE IT! Though I still think it uses too much memory storage It also should have tab groups, like Chrome (RIP).

Download the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life!

The secret path to language learning
Remember the language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely say “Hello!” to a foreigner. Mondly’s approach is different from the average language course.

The future of language courses
The app gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end you will reconstruct the conversation with your voice. Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

The key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors 
Learn pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

State-of-the-art Speech Recognition 
Mondly listens as you pronounce words and phrases. You will get positive feedback if you speak clearly and correctly.

Useful phrases for real situations 
Memorizing isolated words is not the way to learn a language. Mondly teaches you vocabulary through core words and phrases. It breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

Learn from conversations 
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs.

Verb conjugations 
Learn more from this course. Tap the verbs and get the full conjugation, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

Advanced Statistics 
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better.

The Leaderboard 
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner.

Adaptive Learning 
People learn differently. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. Mondly will become your own guide and customized teacher.

At the end of these language lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases, getting you on the fast lane to learning a new language!","Learn Spanish 🇪🇸🇲🇽, English 🇬🇧, French 🇫🇷, German 🇩🇪, Portuguese 🇵🇹🇧🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Russian 🇷🇺, American English 🇺🇸, Norwegian 🇳🇴, Danish 🇩🇰, Dutch 🇳🇱, Swedish 🇸🇪, Korean 🇰🇷, Japanese 🇯🇵, Chinese 🇨🇳, Arabic, Greek 🇬🇷, Romanian 🇷🇴, Vietnamese 🇻🇳, Indonesian 🇮🇩, Hindi 🇮🇳, Hebrew 🇮🇱, Polish 🇵🇱, Bulgarian 🇧🇬, Ukrainian 🇺🇦, Hungarian 🇭🇺, Czech 🇨🇿, Croatian 🇭🇷, Finnish 🇫🇮, Persian (Farsi), Afrikaans, Thai 🇹🇭, Turkish 🇹🇷, Bengali 🇧🇩, Catalan, Latin, Latvian 🇱🇻, Lithuanian 🇱🇹, Slovak 🇸🇰, Tagalog 🇵🇭 and Urdu 🇵🇰 <b>for free.</b><br><br><b>Learn languages</b> with free lessons daily with Mondly.

Enough said. | Actual customer service! I had an issue recovering my account after transferring to a new device, emailed the company, and within a day it was resolved easily and completely. Thanks! | The lessons are simple yet effective. I've learned more in 5 days using this than in high school. I like it so much I've signed up for a yearly subscription! 03/22 ì still love Mondly, however when I try to repeat back to it during a lesson, it often doesn't give mè enough time to speak! I am a ventilator-dependent woman and have to wait on a push air to talk. Is there any way to give me more time to respond? Also, it doesn't always hear my correct responses either, any tips? Me gustan Mondly!! | very good and easy to learn | Sehr gut | Muito bem | ผมชอบแอบนี้. มันใช้งานง่าย. | I like it.. its very useful | thank you | Like it | Good | Super | Nice teaching laguage app | Who ever made this app is a genius.this may be due to multiple classified reasons. But still the best | Membuat saya semangat belajar | It will be great if each highlighted word or selected word inputs, are individually pronounced as they are clicked or selected, it will greatly improve learning and word registering in the brain, also the AI speech recognition requires improvement, in the area of sensitivity and overall performance. The GUI & the verb structuring in the past-present-future tenses is super great other core grammatical syntax guidance, will be nice. But this is a great app and can speed up new language learning, | I can't recommend this App. First off, the conversation training at the end of each training sounds like a great idea, until you realize that it doesn't actually evaluate whether what you said is correct. It just plays back the recording blindly. In addition, this app causes an ungodly amount of spam. Constant notifications, and daily spam emails with reminders that you cannot unsubscribe from. I have unticked all boxes in ""Email preferences"" and it just won't stop´. Unsubscribed. | It's amazing app 😘😘😘😘😘 | Perfect | Like it very much..I would like to try it more before subscribing | Nice app. I like this app | Usefull | very good app | Good | Perfect app | Easy to use. The speed and pronunciation of the bot is excellent. | Top | Thank you app developer | It's good | It's very interesting | Very helpful | Very useful app | Really enjoying using the app, it's easy to do a little everyday and I can feel myself learning a lot, especially learning to read and spell as well as pronunciation of words. The area that the app is lacking is learning to speak the language as in each lesson only one part is conversation and it doesn't really check that you say everything correctly and it's hard to go back and try again. Please make the conversation work more like the ""chat bot"" where it checks pronunciation. PLEASE 🙏 🙏 🙏 | The app it îs useless because they ask for money. Better I pay a teacher of English that to pay an app! I don't recomand those kinds of apps that asks for money, I mean all apps that ask for money!!!!!! | This app is so poor - on the 20th of March 2024 they don't even have a special Norouz lesson. | For now it was perfect, grazie | Very helpful | Great app | This is great 👍 i love it | My experience in this apps isnice because I learn the languages so I rate 4 star | It is very good❤️this app makes us to understand different languages easily. | Simple learning and attractives | It it really easy to learn with even without any tutor🥰❤❤ | Very good app | Really appreciating | Sehr gut | Switched from Duolingo because I stopped getting anything from Duo. Mondly is a whole new league. So much better and far more involved. Much easier to learn from as well and the lessons have actual relevance to life. | Very good | Very good | The program has lots of good information but speech recognition (Japanese) is unusable. | Good | Nice easy i like it | great app | Urdu language is not available bad app | Not happy this app is no more help then I get on free services all over the internet I started the 7day free trial and was charged 49.00 for a year and tried to cancel and ot said would not be canceled for a year seriously according to Google play store they should not of charged me until after rhe 7days . Now I'm trying to get to their customer service and it says I'm over 186436 in line ? If I don't get any response within 24 hrs I will report this fraud to Google playstore as well as my bank | This app helped me a lot | Paid app and not worth | since there is no Serbian language, as a possibility, the grades are lower because it does not accept words from Serbian, but only Croatian translations. you could make a program that accepts both variants. | Very best app for learning | Am raportat un bug in urma cu aproape jumate de an și tot nu s-a rezolvat. In continuare nu merge sunetul când ascult pronunția conjugării verbelor. | Goods and nice | Very good | Amazing app | جيد | ราคาค่อนข้างแพง แต่ชอบมากว่าแอปนกฮูก | I really love love love this app it's been a while I studied French guess what this app really helped pick it up little by little am happy I could learn French | Would be great to have more variety of exercises, flashcards, translations etc. to make practicing more interesting | Buen aprendizaje | User friendly..and amazing way of learning new language in an easy way | Ghatiya | I meet ALLAH i meet prophet muhammad RASUL-ALLAH i meet prophet ebriham RASUL-ALLAH i meet prophet ismail RASUL-ALLAH and sarah i meet prophet adama and awa i meet prophet isa jesus RASUL-ALLAH i am omar Radey-ALLAH ALLAH appeared to me gambia nuimi nemakunku village i was just 13 years old boy my family is from prophet ismail RASUL-ALLAH family in makkah i was born in gambia bakau town ALLAH command me jihadi fight in the course of ALLAH fight those who associates partners in a worship of ALLAH | Very good app for learning languages. I've been learning Afrikaans and Modly has made it very simple for ur beginners 😊 | Very good | Good repitition, choice of Arabic or English script. The hands off audio can be difficult as the voice simetimes does not accept correct answers, and repeats what you say incorrectly. Sometimes it jams completely. | Nice app | Very good app | Fast and easy to learn a new language | Samsung A71, Microphone error.. my turn : mic auto on/off | Charge me without any notification | I like the ending conclusion | Hermosa simplemente hermosa | Teaching method seems boring. Even though I selected intermediate, the teaching seems slow and boring, sorry | First impression OK | Very good ☺️ | Quite a good app for learning pronunciation | Very good | A very good application to learn mulitiple languages in a very easy comfortable way.I like this application | Exceptional | Love this app for sure | Very well | The app is nice, but the chat bot's abilities are limited. When it's doesn't understand what ""ćevapi"" is in a context of a Croatian restaurant that's kinda sad. :) | Very good | I'm enjoying my lessons, there is so much to learn at last I'm able to understand my africaan friends with out them having to translate to me hipee | 👍 | Easy and smart | good learn for Japanese | This is a very nice app to learn languages. Do you want to learn languages please download this app | How do I restore my subscription? I deleted the app by accident and now I am locked out of premium. | So far I like it. I want to carry on a regular conversation | Good to learn | Enjoyable | Very user-friendly. The audio assistant is amazing. Highly recommended it. | Nice app excellent | Very good app | Tạm ổn | Nice app | Free lessons | I love it | Very nice | Good | Actually the app is very good | Perfect | ""你好吗？""are you JOKING?! | A good application that helps you learn the language in a professional and new way | ENGLISH WORD TRANSLATE TODAY SPANISH | I think there is missing a very important language. Maximum people in Asia speak and understand Urdu language, but you missed this. App is wonderful but you should be add the Urdu language for completion. Thanks | Wow | Very educative | Add Esperanto please!! | So so good | Very Easy and better way to learn Arabic, it's is helping me a lot to learn Arabic with it lessons and practice session. | Fee is to High but app is very good and easy to learn more languages which are you learn | Cool 😎 | Easy | Too many repeats the same phrases.

No review or instruction prior to the lesson. No vocabulary you can study. Do you no how to say and spell ""appointment"" in Farsi? I didn't but the app just tossed it out there. Don't try to point this out to customer service. They will give you an assignment such as: send us a video. That's after I sent them a screenshot. Don't pay for the premium version. | I love it | Very helpful | ❣️💯💯💯 | It helps me to learn and pronounce many vocabularies. | Very good | Excellent! | Seems easy to learn but expensive | Excelent | Very easy to use and understand | Sehr gut | So good | Good for vocabulary learning and practice. | I have switched after many years from the owl app and I must say Mondly suits me better. As of today, the Total Hours from daily lessons funny add up, but the support was fast and helpful and forwarded further. The daily lessons could be more variable, there's simply ""too much taxi"" 😅 | very cool | It's ok ig | Easy to use. Great app 👌 | Good | Good, i like it | Great so far | I'm not getting my premium Mondly app on my Samsung Note 10 after changing the cellphone. How do I get back? | It's a good learning app so far! | It is so enlightening. Makes learning simple and interesting | Nice | Very well | Bu uygulama çok faydalı | Good app | The app help well in learning french | It's very good for learning any language . But it is paideble so that's why everybody cannot access to it | Signed up over the web, paid money, app does not register that I have paid. | I learned | تطبيق رائع بصراحة | Easy to use and easy for beginners to grasp concepts and build new vocabulary. I would love to see Irish/Gaelige added to the list of languages to learn soon though! 😄 | Gut | Fun and i can learn easily | Nice | I like app a lot. But, I can't use Chatbot because it's not using microphone. I did give it permission, but it's not registaring it at all. So I can't use fully everything in app. | Good but some time you can't put the right word because it under the check button | Güzel | Thank you for your application, help me to study speak english | Very nice | very well | Great app! | I like the app so far. | I really like studying Greek with this app! It is nice being able to switch between the English alphabet pronunciation and the Greek alphabet pronunciation. Words and phrases are not spoken too fast. Plenty of exercises to work with which include indepth definitions and contextual use for new words. Reasonable cost. The speech recognition can be tricky at times, but mostly works. I am finding myself spending more and more time in this app than I do in other more well known apps. | Eigentlich tolle App für Vokabeln lernen. Bis ich herausfand, dass nicht alles so korrekt ist. zB habe ich heute ein paar Monate wie März April und Mai gelernt, aber die Wörter waren eher aus dem ägyptischen arabisch anstatt hocharabisch. Warum bringt ihr den Menschen slang bei anstatt hocharabisch??? | Well done ✅ | It's so amazing | Very good | Absolutely great app for learning a new language. I love languages but didn't do for years because I didn't have the time. mondly allows me to learn a langiage bit by bit whenever I find some 5 minutes on the go or even half an hour over my lunch break. Only downside is that I have regular connection issues when doing the hands free lesson while driving, that costs a star.

The app finally has speed to it (except when tapping on words to fill them in), and progresses automatically. I love that you listen to users. The content is still a bit wonky and inconsistent at times though, but keep it up."",""I've already deleted this app, which I stack to for more than a month to give it a chance. It's definitely not free, actually the free content is incredibly limited. The biggest flaw I've found in all the offered languages(I've tried them all) is that there are far too many both grammatical and lexical mistakes. I got to the conclusion that most of the content is created by the simple use of the Google Translate. No grammar and completely different translation of English and the goal language."",""I bought this language app because of the variety of languages and the great deal for a lifetime membership. While I am learning some from using it daily, there is definitely room for improvement. Positive: it has categories, such as hotels, restaurants, and more, so you can tailor your learning. Negative:Daily lessons often use random sentences that nobody will use. I have been told how to say the mouse is small several times! Better content needed! Explain grammar a little."",""I can't recommend this App. First off, the conversation training at the end of each training sounds like a great idea, until you realize that it doesn't actually evaluate whether what you said is correct. It just plays back the recording blindly. In addition, this app causes an ungodly amount of spam. Constant notifications, and daily spam emails with reminders that you cannot unsubscribe from. I have unticked all boxes in \""Email preferences\"" and it just won't stop´. Unsubscribed."",""Attractive UI but the user experience is imperfect. Has nice mode where I can converse hands free, yet it never hears single words. When tapping on my phone is required, Mondly often leaves a lot of blank space between the words to be selected and the continue button at the screen bottom. On larger phones this makes the experience less enjoyable. Also, it is really easy to accidentally redo a lesson because the new lesson isn't highlighted and the lesson just completed remains center screen.""]",false,false,false,"com.atistudios.mondly.languages","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Should be one click. | amazing application. every pay Is simply with it | easy way to pay | I hate the aggressive pushing for giving a tip. You are unable to pay until you select a tip and selecting zero means four more clicks. Definitely deceptive dark ux pattern. Let users set their default tip in settings, including no tip. | Dříve fungovalo perfektně, teď najednou potřebuje instalaci a registraci a další nesmyslné osobní údaje do kterejch jim nic není... | bitcoin option rocks | Works well, even with Google Pay after a bit of initial hickups. Saves time when paying in restaurants. | its too slow, but works | Great, intuitive and simple app | Skvělá aplikace a velice mě potěšilo placení btc. Funguje to na jedničku | need an app to read the menu? your the waste of air | Great BTC/LN integration | You should let people set their own default tip. Ten per cent is not the default in reality, it should not be the default in the app either. We're not in US, tips are not mandatory and should not be expected for mediocre service. | Aplikace Qerko vám nabídne možnosti dýška evidentně inspirované v USA, počínaje 20% (kdo v ČR dává tak moc???) a doplněno smajlíky naznačujícími že cokoliv méně než 10% znamená nespokojenost. 0% ze základních možností ani nejde zvolit, musíte vybrat ""vlastní částka"". Je to absurdní, zvlášť když objednání a placení řeší aplikace. Jestli chce restaurace o 10-20% více peněz, ať zdraží, tyhle západní manýry si fakt nechte. | Nefunguje odesílání plateb na věrností kartu. Resp. odeslání se nepovede, pokud během placení dojde k potvrzení platby, volání na externí službu zřejmě expiruje. Je to škoda, pač se kvůli tomu nedají sbírat slevy za věrnost. Takže aplikace je celkem k ničemu. | I think the passive agressive smiley face when giving tips is the worst idea you could have. It only convince me not to give any tips. | Mam pocit ze casteji tu aplikaci musim aktualizovat, nez s ni platim. | App works really well. Only thing that drives me crazy is when somebody from your table goes to pay at the bar the old fashioned way, you're not able to pay by Qerko until the waiter closes your table at the bar. Sometimes they leave it open until someone else goes to pay, then you're not able to pay with Qerko at all. That gets really frustrating. | Not working with mobile network. Edit: After latest update it's working perfectly, thanks! | Cannot use cards stored in Google wallet /Google pay, even though these work in other apps without any problems. | Love the app. In my local restaurant they printed red and white qr codes. The app on my samsung cannot read it. Other qr reader apps on my samsung can read it normally. | Rychlé a dělá to co má | Hi, why it is not possible to pay by Google Pay? There is this payment option, but each time it fails. Thank you. | Fine app, but you cannot migrate your account to other device and you have poor management of receipts. QR code readability is usually very dependent on light conditions. Edit: Discounts and loyalty programme does not work sometimes. Support is fine, but could be a bit better. | Good idea but.. The need to register to another extra app is not justified for the value. If there was an option to register via Google, I would try that. But to fill the form like it's 2010? No thanks. Edit: the registration is now much more comfortable through Google auth. Raising my review from 3* to 5* | I don't understand why I need to download an app to view the menu. Very user unfriendly. | Aplikace funguje většinu času v pořádku, placení s ní je jednoduché, vybrání odměn je poněkud neintuitivní, ale nevymyslel bych to lépe. Podpora, zdá se, aktivně řeší problémy, měním tedy svou recenzi na 5*. | Stop guilting me into tipping. Tipping isn't the norm in this country, why do you add an emoji that indicates I've had a bad time when adding 0% tip? | Very nice idea, application is very smooth, makes the payments faster, hope more business to adapt the application. | I doesn't even open | Marketingová sdělení a aplikace běžící na pozadí i když ji nepoužívám?? Co to má ksakru znamenat? Tohle bych od platební appky teda vážně nečekal. | Aplikace mi nenabizi platbu pres google pay... koncim na CSOB platebni brane... asi nejaka chyba, kamaradum funguje | Great app, quick payment, no need to wait for anyone to pay the bill in a restaurant. | Awesome service. I use it any time I see it in a restaurant. | WOW, this needs to be everywhere. It saves so much time and hassle. Once you are ready to leave, just scan the QR/NFC, pick which items you want to pay (great it you are e.g. splitting a bill), pay wit your card / GPay etc. (you can also leave a tip), and walk away. No need to get the waiter's attention and wait for them to come and let you pay. They can have more time to do things where they bring value where apps can't - welcoming guests, helping them pick the meal, bringing an order. | Proč mně nutí přidávat platební metodu za když chci zaplatit? A stejně nrjsem schopen zaplatit. Až po chvíli jsem pochopil, že musím posunout šípku zleva doprava. Bez jakekoliv nápovědy. Proč nestačí kliknout na zaplatit? | Add Bitcoin (BTC, BCH) payments support for 5 stars please :) | Ze zacatku, fungovala dobre, pak obcas ne, zejmena problem s gpay, musel jsem zmenit zpusob platby. Obcas jsem i tak nezaplatil, coz bylo neprijemne, zvlast,kdyz jsem nemel hotovost. Jindy jsem zaplatil pres apku, ale i kdyz se mi platba blokovala v bance, neprojevila se v restauraci. Mel jsem cca 3 tydny blokovane prostredky v bance, pritom jsem musel platit v hotovosti. Kdyby fungovala bez problemu, tak super. Sanci jeste dam. | Aplikace automaticky nenápadně předvyplňuje 10% spropitné. Když ho vypnete, nepamatuje si to a dalši objednavku ho tam hodí znovu. Za mě je to úmysl - snaze o pohodlí uživatele težko věřit, tou by bylo aspoň pamatovat si předchozí volbu. Za mě je to trošku podvod na zákazníka a aplikace, které se mě snaži nachytat, v telefonu z principu nechci. Pokud někomu chci dát spropitné, úmyslně mu ho dám (nebo lépe nechám na stole hotovost). Pokud mu ho dat nechci, nechci myslet na to ho v aplikaci rušit. | Edit: I missed Google Pay si far, but it was recently added. I'm looking forward to try it out. | Fix the missing possibility to add a card from gpay automatically. No popup shows, so the card number must be entered manually, thats frustrating. | Nefunkční. Nelze přidat edenred kartu. | Today I tried to use the app and it was faulted. 2 purchases and 2 days (due to public holidays) remained before loyalty conditions will be satisfied. It's very strange. I'm gonna put aside the app for a while. | Doesn't support Google pay, requires registration, too complicated | Adding payment method fails for 3 cards and two banks. Does not support google pay. Basically useless. Fortunately, I could pay with my phone using NFC and the account this app would not accept. Edit: seems it was only some sort of down time. I would like to see google pay/account integration for Android users. Stars increased to 4. | Good idea, working smoothly, cool app. | Google Pay is missing | Why I have add card if I have Google Pay?! | Unable to establish (a) secure connection = unusable | What is this, vigorous really vigorous | Fantastic! We'll, would be great if you also add a possibility to order. | It was a great app, until it forgot my Visa details. Now the 3D Secure gateway doesn't load in the app correctly, so can't re-add it UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2020: Suddenly I'm able to add cards again, rating adjusted | Nápad je super, ale - nemožnost použití Google autentizace a taktéž chybějící integrace s Google Pay je celkem zásadní problém | Good UI. Requires creating account (okay) and entering/linking card details (wrong). I would rather be redirected to payment gateway and leave the rest on my OS/phone. Update: Card info is not stored, great! | Cool idea, I'd love to see this in more bars and restaurants. Good luck | Works great! Would appreciate support of google pay. Maybe ordering of food/drinks sometime in future? | Dobrý napad, vse funguje skvěle. Šel by vylepšit onboarding platební karty např. naskenování fotoaparátem.

But other then that great app! | excelente | It's a good app. But would be much better if there was a way to slow down the play back of the translation,I'd like to learn the sentence I'm translating. Would be a five start app if it had that function | Huge update on 22/02. Exactly what I needed. Here's 5 stars. Keep up the good work. | free, easy to use. | This app is awesome!! | Deep™ © ® CE UKCA. SIGNED: Öctaévius. | The fact this app is free with better qualities and features than Google translate amazes me! I'm trying to learn Português (Brasil) and this app helps me a lot with constructing sentences with the beginner knowledge I have on the language! | Fantastic | please fix your app, it keeps saying ""hang on theres a problem"" every time I want to translate words and makes me forced to go back to google translate even though I love this app. | Thank you. | Very useful especially when I have conversations with my Japanese cousin. | Needs work. The app will translate foreign words you type into the box. However, if you click the camera icon to try and translate a pdf page and a word doc screenshot page written in the exact same foreign language choice into English. It wouldn't do it. Kept showing onscreen error message, 'feature disabled, language not supported'. Yet it translates the words you type in. Google Translate is the reliable option. | Was brilliant, now only ever says ""something went wrong"" when I use audio input | I've been using this for years now. It's WAY better than Google translate. The new option to see alternative words and sentences is a great touch as well. If you want to see more natural sounding translations, this is highly recommended. | I don't like,bc my language is not here.That's not good.They are said all the language,but my language is not here.👎👎 | Remek fordítóprogram, egészen kiváló minőségben és adottságokkal. | Fácil de utilizar y tiene un buen nivel de traducción coloquial | Translations are not working. | Great source! | Still in the testing phase, but quite impressive and accurate. | very okay | great | Very useful app 👍 | It keeps throwing the 503 error code, nah the uptime is unreliable as hell I ain't using this app anymore. | The translation accuracy is quite awesome. I've been assisted many times over the years by the app. The UI is easy to use to boot. Highly recommended. | I love it | it is helpful when translating words and phrases in other languages | Able to translate larger files and not only sections of a text compared to other apps I have been using. I did have to register on the app first though for larger files / texts. Starting to like it more & more while using it on a daily basis. | the best translation app !!!! | Great translations! | great translation. native integration with android would be even better but the app per se is a great start | need more improvement | Better than google translator. | Probably the best translator to ever exist. | Fantastic aid to learning French but the latest update has 2 problems. When the tablet is in portrait orientation the speaker icon doesn't work on the translation side. And if I try to log in it just keeps cycling and never logs in. I can log in on my browser but not on the app. Plus when the app keeps trying to log in the apps doesn't translate. | the site is awesome but this app is really bad.

You should fix it! | Best translations app. Very high level accuracy!! | Good quality translation for Spanish for me. options and word choice too. | It's very good for the languages included so far. It just needs a wider range, for example Cymraeg! (""Welsh"") | These are much better translations than what you default. Get from Google translate. Google translate is integrated in my pixel so it is more convenient, but whenever I'm puzzled over a translation it provides I take it to deep. L and get the answer that makes more sense. It's worth the money | Very friendly | excellent app | It even lets me translate slurs! | I like it, this app is easier to use and without ads.

Highly recommend | Loved it. This review is coming in 10 minutes from the install time so you can understand how much I love it. Totally satisfied. What exactly I needed. | nice work 👍 simply cool | still not support all languange | Greetings and don't be tired to the programmers of this artificial intelligence. I am really surprised that among the languages ​​that this software is able to translate, there is no Persian language, which is one of the oldest and most complete languages ​​in terms of conceptual structure. I am really sorry and I hope Soon we will see Persian language added to the vocabulary of this great artificial intelligence. Thank you in advance for your attention | Doesn't work | One of the most accurate translet apps I've ever used. The interface is simple. | Why don't you make a quick translate button that will be located in the quick settings menu (among the wifi, bluetooth, etc. buttons). So that the translation button is not always on the screen and does not waste additional resources and screen space. So that I can copy the text somewhere, open the quick settings, click on the translation button and then the translation window will open. | Quite useful, in fact very useful for translate words or sentences I don't understand. | brilliant | Nice n useful | good | Very good application | Pretty good app. I wish I could download the TTS Voices through THIS app rather than my Samsung phone, it's time consuming and doesn't even have So Ukrainian language. | When it works, it is my favorite. But the App locks up. Auditory function fails. This is a long-standing issue. I am deleting the app and reinstalling it in Google play store. | Is an amazing app for translation | Great app that gets you the accurate meaning | I love you | Очень много ошибок и глюков в работе мобильной версии. Перевод с немецкого на русский и обратно работает очень плохо, оба поля пишут латиницей или наоборот русским языком. К сожалению, не работает распознавание устной немецкой речи, а для английского оно слабое. | Great | 👍🏾 | very good work... | As far the Best translator in my experience. | Hopefully Hindi, Thai and Vietnamese will be added soon. A great app otherwise. Accurate, easy to use and best of all it makes Google Translate obsolete. | I recommend 👌 it's the best translate app. | The most accurate translation app. | Very useful and offers alternative translations | best app ever | Absolutely fantastic app. I didn't know how much I needed the picture to text translator until I got it.Great job | very nice app | Not Google Translate, yet it is. | best | great, efficient, easy to use. many languages available. more accurate then google translate. | 100 precent accuracy 100 precent real | very good tool | Nice apps, easy to translate | After adding Arabic language, u're the best now | The app is pretty darn accurate on its translations and even gives suggestions on how to make your sentences even better. I am very much happy with this app, and it's been an enjoyable experience learning from it. | The best! | Apparently, this DeepL App translates less literally than Google. A native Italian colleague of mine said, ""DeepL is more human, Google is more literal."" | Good for translate written text but when I try to speech to text function it shows me ""To use this feature, give the Speech Services app microphone permission"". I go to settings but the permissions are all granted I can't use this function but I don't know why. The microphone is working properly with any other app, Google Translate too | thank you | Pretty good, i like the alternative translations, they are pretty useful | perfect perfect perfect | Perhaps Deepl is one of the best Translator apps but the subscription fees are too expensive for a poor beginner | It is super accurate, and it gives you different options to choose from. | Awesome | الترجمة العربية دقيقة وممتاز جدا | best app | Best most useful & effective translator I've used | Not Bad | It's cool | I like it more than the google one, that's all | reliable, quality translations. | Excellen choice. | Its a pretty cool app, am grateful coz it has enabled me communicate with ease! | No, sirve pará nada | Very good app to use ! Most accurate . An backup for Google translate | Super! | I like this translator | Even worse than google translate, also duplicating the same word for translation. lacks certain languages. disappointed with recent gtranslate? this isnt it. | Great app. One of the few I've found that really gets Portugal Portuguese, it is free and no ads. Very clean interface. Wish it had an off line feature, would happily pay for that feature. | Will give one more extra star if we can login with our Google account and one other star if we can save offline dictionary so we can translate even if no internet | It would be helpful if it was translating swearing words. Instead you get ***** which is useless | Picture translation feature does not work | Dude seriously, what the hell? The app doesn't translate from pictures anymore. It keeps the original language the same, that is to say Japanese text on a picture doesn't translate to English. The translation remains the same. This was working fine, now you broke it. Also it doesn't allow me to highlight specific text anymore. Why would you remove this functionality? Just another case of app devs trying to fix stuff that ain't broken. What're y'all smoking? | Useful because it has European Portuguese. Thank you! | The best translator yet. Keep up the good work! | My experience with DeepL is really fun. It's easy and convenient to use. But I would love if it could have been automatic page translator and you can translate directly on your chat on any page. | DeepL was great in helping me on my trip to Japan. I'm still learning the language and by using the app, I was able to communicate more complicated sentences and translate when store staff were trying to help me find something. | Totally get this app if you need to translate anything! I recommend it for anyone. | Hey! I love the app, but everytime I try to log in to do a translation with larger word content ...it says ""technical error"" I have registered...but it just won't go in. I tried to download the app again and it still won't allow me to log in. Feedback please? | Awesome translator! Better than Google one at least in two languages. | I like all of the features and their uses, it's just perfect to me that you can even translate while watching a serie or scrolling | Najlepszy tłumacz z jakim miałem do czynienia. Edit: Trochę czasu minęło od napisania przeze mnie pierwotnej opinii i ... Wszystko idzie do przodu a deepl się cofa, wprowadzone ograniczenia w długości tekstu dla darmowego użytkownika oraz fakt jak bardzo aplikacja odbiega jakością tłumaczenia w porównaniu z tłumaczeniami za pomocą GPT skutecznie ją dyskwalifikują. Po co z sentymentu płacić za coś co można mieć za darmo ze znacznie większą dokładnością tłumaczenia? | great app, translates very well. | why this app claim is completely free not mention to pro version just after u download app | nice app | Absoloutly brilliant. | A good alternative to Google Translate | just so easy to use | A great app! | better then other | dont work | Very good, no other words 🤗👍 | Overall not to bad but constantly mixes up the 'he and she' pronouns when using the audio translator fromChinese to english. | I do not have any words | It helps so much with my German language | Although this has been recommended to me by a lot of people, I haven't tried it until this year and I regret not using this earlier. The pronunciations are much more accurate compared to a certain other widespread translator. The translations as well; I love that it gives the option to choose the format of each sentence, clarifying each word. It has helped me make sense of different slangs and more complicated sentences. (ie. languages with optional first person nouns, different grammar etc) | When I use it on my laptop I reach very fast after few sentences the ""max daily limit"". Here is 1 star for shortening the daily limit to few sentences. Take the fee for monthly subscription and shove it... also it is slow and often there is message saying the site is overloaded due to high usage. But maybe if you put 20 euro monthly fee that will solve your problems haha 🤡 | nice translation | Sadly, This app is unable to resolve text from a machine display that Google translate can. This app detects no text. I'll admit the contrast isn't great but this app doesn't even make an attempt where Google translate does. | I didn't like new update its worse than old version, what did you do.

If it gets sorted, I'll give it more stars."",""Although this has been recommended to me by a lot of people, I haven't tried it until this year and I regret not using this earlier. The pronunciations are much more accurate compared to a certain other widespread translator. The translations as well; I love that it gives the option to choose the format of each sentence, clarifying each word. It has helped me make sense of different slangs and more complicated sentences. (ie. languages with optional first person nouns, different grammar etc)"",""Why don't you make a quick translate button that will be located in the quick settings menu (among the wifi, bluetooth, etc. buttons). So that the translation button is not always on the screen and does not waste additional resources and screen space. So that I can copy the text somewhere, open the quick settings, click on the translation button and then the translation window will open."",""This app just keeps getting better. When it first released, there were no options to log in as a Pro user, upload documents and images, or see alternate translations. I added stars as they added features, and the one thing that was still missing was the per-word changes that have been a staple of the desktop version. Now they have that in this app, so I have no complaints. DeepL is the most accurate machine translation service I know of outside of some specialized ones for single language pairs.""]",false,false,false,"com.deepl.mobiletranslator","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepl.mobiletranslator&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Mam Pixel 6 a Android 14. Předtím úplně bez problémů, ted kliknu na Oblibene a pad aplikace, stejne kdyz vstoupím do kategorii potravin. | Asi nejhorší objednávka aplikace v Česku. Pomalá, seká se, špatně se v ní orientuje a ceny jsou nejvyšší na českém trhu. | Výběr času doručení nefunguje, nelze vybrat čas doručení, tak jak více z apky ani nemohl vyzkoušet :D | V nové verzi (která mne automaticky odhlásila) se nejde přihlásit. Po kliknutí na ""Přihlásit se"" se objeví jen načítání stránky, která je ale celá černá a prázdná. | Již delší dobu nefunguje přihlášení pomoci google účtu. Pro používání online verze je potřeba aplikaci vymazat, jinak ji prohlížeč automaticky otevírá. :( | After the last update I can't open details of any product - the app closes immediately. | Never logged in when I meed it and the UI is generally worse than web page. No features like scanning what you would like ahead of time. | Sekce můj košík nefunguje | Nonstop me aplikace odhlasuje z mobilni aplikace. | Cannot login because you can't copy paste into password field on your stupid website. Can't you do login in the app without using Web view? Seriously? | Nikdy neplatit předem, ani jednou jak jsem zaplatila kartou hned mi nákup nedoručili ani nenabídli žádné vyřešení. | Notifikace do telefonu s reklamami snad 2x tydne bez moznosti opt out? Tentokrát den deti, ci co. Telefon je velice personalni vec, takze tyhle notifikace mne pekne dopaluji. Mutnul jsme vsechny notifikace od vas, ale ted se ani nedozvim, když mi budete chtit pushnout neco k me objednavce. | dej slevu more | 10/10 obchod, 1/10 aplikace, chybí základní funkcionalita stránek (hlavně *filtry*, vrácení tam kde jsem byl po rozkliknuti individuálního produktu, srdíčko produktu že stránky produktu, zobrazení všech produktů značky že stránky produktu atd.) Vykucháno za hranicí uživatelnosti, aplikace se dá dobře využít akorát na přidávàní z oblíbených. | Do nedávného redesignu to byla skvělá aplikace, ale teď byla z pro mě nepochopitelného důvodu odstraněna funkce Oblíbené položky - a to nejen z rychlého menu, ale kompletně. Vzhledem k tomu, že na jejím základě sestavuji své nákupy, je pro mě teď aplikace zcela nepoužitelná... Nezbývá než se vrátit k webové verzi. Naprostý fail. | Po aktualizaci zmizela možnost přidavat položky poslední objednávky. Je to hrůza. Musíme pokaždé přidávat všechno znovu?! | A little difficult for Anglophones, but solid nonetheless. Thanks. Service is also very reliable, even though I live in a house that is kinda hard to find. 👍 | Since their latest updates last week, I cannot login to my account and asked their help. They asked me to log into my email which means log in from the email sent, but never arrived to my email inbox. They said they will let me know the updates, but never comes to me either. The app malfunction puts me off to use their services although their selection of things were good. Hugely disappointed with the current situation. | Good speed and UI. Search in English language can be enhanced. | English version missing. Apart from that very good app and service | backspace make keyboard disappear...poskal jsem vam email a video | Fast, clear and basic shopping. | Je škoda že v aplikaci nejsou vidět Nákupní Seznamy, které se používají ve webové aplikaci. | Convenient and responsive application. Better than competition's apps. | Could not pay by card in the app. I had to choose the option to pay with the courier. The button was just irresponsive. Also, there is no option to filter the certain product by the price like in online version. | Great application and great service. Everytime my all orders came in exact time and exact amount/brand. They are always helpful and listening everything what customers say. Košík is better than other shopping services in the Czech Republic. Thank you. | Košík je nejlepší! | How can I change the language in english so I can use it? | Pro uživatele registrované přes Facebook není možné se v aplikaci přihlásit (Facebook blokuje login v rámci frame) | It is OK, I can see huge progress, but still many things to improve :) | Well organized by category, easy to find products, quick without glitches. Over all, the app works very well. | Flexible and handy | Pokud otevru kategorii, z ni otevru produkt a jdu zpět, úplně ztratím stav katalogu a musim filtrovat znovu. Bohužel nepoužitelné. | Super easy to use 👍 | Working fine. | Rychlý nákup a platba! Ještě bych chtěla v menu možnost vidět Novinky. | Je to dobré. Dá se nakupovat hlasem. | Aplikace nepoužitelná. Nejdřív nešlo přidat adresu do účtu. To jsem udělal na webu a pak nešlo odeslat objednávku, protože se ""nepodařilo přidat adresu k objednávce"". Takže aplikaci prozatím mažu. | Dobrý sortiment ale nespolehlivá služba. Objednaný nákup na osmou hodinu se řidiči ""někam zatoulal"". O pár minut později telefonát - vrátit peníze nebo přivezeme nejdřív za 7 hodin. To v případě, že se na nákup spoléháte zrovna nepotěší. S Košíkem tedy naposledy. Zákazník na prvním místě nebo customer obsession, to jsou hesla ze kterých se mají české firmy ještě hodně co učit.... | English version would be great | Chybi mi moznost radit zbozi podle ceny (ceny za jednotku) a dalsi podobne ""malickosti"". | Excellent service | Waiting for the english version...have to use other competitor for now | Nice app but there is no English version, even though it's widely used by English speakers. I am sure that the management wouldn't care about this feedback because why would they, we still pay them anyway. This is what's holding this country back. They don't wanna work, yet they still wanna get paid, unbelievable. Anyway, I got used to it. | You can not login with your email after you registered with facebook. You can not change your account to activate email login. Welcome to the prehistoric times. And they lied here in response. | Does not support English | Still not translated into English 😤👎🙄⁉️ | Great servis xxx | Amazing app, very good services. One thing I can complain about is that there's no English version. I hope someone will hear it, because it is easy to do and it will help a lot of users:) You're the best 😘 | Is it possible to change the language to English or it is only in Czech? Thanks | Need English language as well.. | Good prices, clean app. | For good job | Na první pohled aplikace vypadá dobře. Když jsem začal vyhledávat zboží, zjistil jsem, že nejde řadit podle názvu/ceny/ceny za jednotku... Jde-li to, nevím kde. Žádný help, průvodce... Pro mě bez řazení nepoužitelné a zdržující. | The app itself is OK but the actual delivery of ordered goods is terrible. Every single time the driver forgets to deliver one or two bags. Every single time. | Terrible! When you look at a favourite product it's there for order. When eventually you have got to the checkout it becomes unavailable! I will give my money to a company which can deliver! Zero stars! | Application works great, grocery delivered on time. Overall great service, can't complain! | Aplikace funguje a je přehledná. Jedné co mi chybý je možnost seřadit zboží podle ceny, kvůli tomu musím přeskakovat na webový prohlížeč. | Cool | Super apka. Akorát chybí tlačítko bez Andreje :) a bez palmového oleje. A chybí řazení dle ceny, nebo jsem lama a nevšiml jsem si ho. | 👍 | App doesn't work.. | Aplikace je prakticky nepoužitelná, daleko horší než aplikace od Rohlik.cz a Tesco. Nelze měnit řazení výrobků (např. řadit podle ceny), nelze se prokliknout z detailu výrobku (který jsem našel třeba přes vyhledávání) zpět na seznam všech výrobků v dané kategorii. Lepší je použít obyčejný web Kosik.cz než tuhle příšernou aplikaci :-( | Velky spatny, server hlasi chybu... Uz tyden se tahle hlaska objevuje a neni mozne nakupovat. | Totálně nepřehledné, bez možnosti filtrování a kategorií. Vyhledávání podivné - hledám Mattoni, zadám matto a zboží nenalezeno. přidám jedno písmeno - matton a už vidím Mattonky. Musíte se víc snažit... | moc spatne ... temer nefunkcni vyhledavani a nutnost najednou povolit jak reklamni emaily tak informace o objednavce ... | Kategorizace produktů je opravdu tragická. Vyhledávání to samé. Myslel jsem, že to bude optimalizované pro mobil a tedy lepší než web, ale to je velký omyl. Takže apka k ničemu!

Oceňuji možnost výběru kategorií (nebo vypnutí, např. produktů pro zvířata), hodilo by se přidat přímé reklamace jako na Rohlíku. Samovolné odhlašování pominulo, ale poslední verze je pomalejší a má horší ergonomii. Produkty jsou nahodile promíchané, což spolu s jejich pomalým načítáním dost znepříjemňuje nákup. | Položky jako zelí nejdou objednat na kusy ale jen na kila. Ostružiny jsme dostali plesnivé. Víckrát se nám stalo, že objednaná potravina expirovala hned druhý den. Sami bychom si do košíku vybrali lépe. Některé položky, které v Albertovi jsou, online nejsou. Dáte hledat ""rohlik"" a vyhledá vám to jen alkohol. Aplikace zamrzá. Zkusíme Tesco. | Dobrý den, je prosím možné ponechat původní velikost ikon v nákupním košíku atd? Nové velké ikony jsou až příliš velké, na obrazovku telefonu se takto vleze výrazně méně položek, což zbytečně komplikuje použití appky. Taktéž prison o možnost trvalého přihlášení v aplikaci. Předem děkuji za zvážení | oproti rohlíku a košíku je aplikace docela bída z pohledu UX a příjemností pouzivani | aplikace naprosto nepouzitelna kvuli obchodnim podminkam - vice nez 30 stran - povinnost nekolik hodin pravidelneho cteni i pred kazdym nakupem!?! . . . Arogantni odpoved: ""smirte se s tim"". | user friendly and great for specials | Domů zdarma, ale za dopravu si nejspíše zaplatíte, ponovu. Vyhledávání bych naprogramoval lépe i za den. Dokonce jsem vám na to poslal nabídku, ale neobdržel od vás žádnou reakci. | aplikácia je intuitívna, dobre sa s ňou pracuje, aj vyhľadávanie funguje dobre. chýba mi prepojenie Albert bonusového klubu s aplikáciou. | Nebyl problem uskutecnit cely nakup a najit vsechny produkty. | would be nice to have the app optimised for tablets as well | Good app, I would appreciate if saved shopping list can also be arranged by categories/items grouped together. It's that possible, please? Thanks in advance! | No English | Hodne pomala aplikace | Již lze objednávat přes PC. | opravte si terminy dodani. je to docela zasadni. vyberu sobota a v aplikaci se nacte nedele atd!!! | Absence podopory jazyku. Google pay. UI nesikovne a neprehledne udelane nacpat tam vikendovy nakup je fuska. A nakonec na samsungu S22 si ocividne ani nezaplatim kartou 6 pokusu a zadre se to na external prohleci a to ze si nepamatuje zadane karty radej nemluvim. | After 1 year the English language still missing... Is it so complicated? | I ordered water and application took additional payment from me because of possible differences in weight. It is not a free delivery they took money from us anyway. | Nemuzou zaplatit za nakup! | Je fajn, že existuje služba, která doručí domů zadarmo. Aplikace je ale velmi nepraktická, práce s ní je zdlouhavá. Albert má také mnohem větší sortiment, než který nabízí zde. | Apka super, len pridávanie do košíka chce prepracovať | aplikaci si nevyhledem pod klicovym slovem albert, pri vyhledavani v aplikaci mi vyskakuji irelevantní výsledky Edit: v obchode se aplikace najde, ale jakozto běžný uživatel aplikaci otvírat z aplikací v telefoně a ne přes obchod | Aplikace je neskutečně pomalá, někdy neregistruje dotyk na displej (i když do toho klepu jak datel), a když se snažím v nákupním seznamu sjet až dolů, tak mě aplikace vrací do prostředí seznamu. | Je fajn, ze je videt nejaky rozvoj, ale nejde triditnapr podle Bio. Celkove pomale reakce aplikace | One of the best apps I've ever used!!! | pomalé, nepřehledné,bez webové alternativy | Why was my review removed? | Sortiment je celkem omezený (např. chybí cukr krystal), aplikace se načítá docela pomalu. Ale jinak je to docela fajne. | Only in CZ and as it is an app only (not possible to view through web browser) it is not possible to translate. | Po nainstalování jsem ověřil email a aplikace mne vyzvala k nákupu. Vybral jsem, ale platba se nepovedla. Po delším zkoumání jsem si všiml, že nemám vyplněné oslovení a telefon. Vyplnil jsem a zkusil platbu znovu. Opět neúspěšně. Pak jsem si vzpomněl na ""Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again?"", vynutil jsem ukončení aplikace, spustil, ignoroval výzvu k potvrzení mailu a ejhle, platba se povedla.*** Mimochodem, když vyhledám zboží, proč se mi nezobrazí křížek na smazání vyhledávacího pole hned, ale až do toho pole ťuknu? V okamžiku, kde se mi zobrazují vyhledané produkty, není na stránce nic, čím bych se mohl vátit do seznamu kategorií.*** Když něco vyhledám, hodil by se mi z daného artiklu proklik na příslušnou kategorii (třeba z informačnho okna, tam je místa dost).*** Hledám banan - zobrazí se nalezené banány, banány v čokoládě, kiwi? mango? avokádo? Hledám Banán, nabídne mi vyhledávat v Banán Výživa, Banán v Raw, Banán v Suché plody (2x? - aha - dvě různé kategorie se jmenují stejně, takže problém dat a ne přímo programátorů aplikace). ***Když kupuji např. ananas, dozvím se cenu jednoho kusu. A pak se nechám překvapit velikostí? (Uznávám, tohle není na programátory, pošlete to dále :-)). *** Jak se kupuje 5kg brambor, když chci koupit brambory volné? (Nápověda - Rohlík mě sice taky nechá klikat jako bych hrál nějakou hru, ale kromě počtu kusů zobrazuje odhad váhy, programátoři Tesca mne nechají brambory a podobné nakoupit na kusy nebo na váhu.) *** Přišlo mi oznámení ""Omlouváme se ..."", ťukl jsem na něj, otevřela se aplikace, ale za co se omlouvají jsem nezjistil. A oznámení je už pryč. | Only in Czech | The usability could improve, I find the Bascet view quite small. | Nelze změnit heslo, nemůžu se do aplikace přihlásit. Prosím o rychlé vyřešení. | Ověřit e-mail lze jenom přes appku. Co je tohle za nápad (: Ne všichni žijou svůj celý život na mobilu. | Vše vpořádku! | No translation renders it useless. Good try | Naprosty trash | I pay with the same coin always. learn to speak English because when you visit other countries, oops, hahahahahaaa you dont visit to much, just Slovakia , Croatia and thats it cause the rest of counties will ask if you speak English but NOT the local language. So stop telling us foreigners to learn Czech, is not a easy language, especially for the ones from latin countries. | There is no English language selection.

Nie działa przekierowanie do produktu z listy moich zamówień. Problematyczny proces reklamacji/zwrotów. W aplikacji, nawet jak jesteśmy zalogowani i chcemy złożyć reklamację, to jesteśmy proszeni bezsensownie o zalogowanie, które nie działa.

For several footwear products size chart is a total nonsense. | Awful loyalty program. The voucher received for my birthday can be used only for certain products and also not for those already discounted. | The application does not work effectively. After setting filters, it often happens that the ""views"" button does not appear | Doesn't work properly this app for long time...

La fel si la codul primit la abonarea la newsletter. Cel putin corectati mesajele de eroare, ca sa stiu ca nu se cumuleaza reducerile... | The app is running so slow, I am literally afraid to tap on the heart (to mark a product as favourite) to avoid clicking on the product because if I do so, I must wait like 2 minutes for app to access it and 1 minute to go back. | Ordered 2 t-shirts, never came, after 4 phonecalls they said i would get my money back, still waiting. | The filter function is so frustrating, even though I select what my interests are, I still have to browse through thousands of products, not working at all, giving me men options when I select women...I see that despite of all the reviews on this, nothing gets changed for the better. Also the promotional codes are never working, why would you send me those if the app does not recognize the promotional code... | One of the worst app for clothes and shoes.

The app in general and what it offers is great but every page you change it has seconds of lags. It's a shame that it hasn't been fixed in so long cause it makes browsing and shopping unpleasant. | Три пъти правя поръчки и нищо не получавам. Не поръчвайте от тях Измамници! | Ordered Armani sport suit and it came in less than 5 days and it exactly what I ordered and 100% original for a great price! The way lower than in the local shops! Great experience! | Respect! | Aplikacja jest super estetyczna, ale niedoróbki w flow jej działania strasznie irytuja. Kilka przykładów: - co chwilę znikają przyciski dolnej nawigacji - flow koszyka wprowadza w błąd - cena dostawy nie dolicza się do kwoty zakupu od razu i dopiero po kliknięciu ""zamów"" dowiedziałam się że dostawa nie była w cenie | Excelent. | It's not working anymore.

I don't get it, way not make an english version at least. | Where is the English version, at least? | Bad search engine! | Got an ad with the app and it's everything in polish so I can't understand it. If you are making an international app, make it in English with an option to change in who cares what language. | First run in pl language. Had to figure out with google translate how to switch to English | Everything is in polish. I can't understand anything. If you are planing to be use by other countries than Poland...

De asemenea, linkurile pentru retur nu funcționează. Ar putea fi mai bine | Работата с приложението е лесно. Изключително досадно е да получаваш код за отстъпка, който като въведеш да ти изписва грешка. Каква грешка, защо е грешка? Нещо да обясните? | Thank you !! Gàbor :) | After the last update the app is not working, i have only a blank image. | Постоянно ми птедлага женски дрехи при положение, че съм мъж. Често изписва неща на полски...съжелявам, но полски не разбирам, можете на английски да си направите основата, като има грешка, да разбираме какво ""цъкаме"" | Although the app is constantly advertised in Modivo.bg, there can't seem to be a way to change it from Polish to Bulgarian version. | Terrible app | ОПЦИЯТА ЗА ВРЪЩАНЕ НА ПРОДУКТ Е УЖАСНА | One polished star | awful, very bad app | I can't relocated to Bulgarian or English language | Very bad, gives polish version and veey diffict to understand how to change setting | Awful app, only in their native language, although the app is used throughout Central and Eastern Europe... | Start screen in Polish?! No Way you can get to the menu for language change, unless you know polish. | Initially it launches in Polish which is not ideal for non-polish customers. I had to use a translator to change the settings. It would have been nice if we could select the language on the very first screen. | Polish only! And if you have registered in the web in any other languages, this is not valid for the app -- pure data collection | Worst clothes online shop | Never got the sale code The app is in a foreign language Mail and psw never worked Never answered the phone | Not a review.

How even is this possible to not use geolocation for default language settings in 2022?!?!? | Aplicatia nu porneste in engleza. Pana am reusit sa schimb limba a durat ceva timp. Si a fost din noroc. Sa vedem cum merge mai departe. | Imposibil de completat datele pentru retur | App in Polish only!!! It is useless | Only in Polish language and cannot change it in another language. Useless app! | after you install the app you must accept or reject options that are not in English, but some foreing language | No possibility to change the language and which is worse the curancy. All the prices are in zloty. It's useless. | The app is in polish and I do not understand this language. | On Romanian modivo suggested to download the app but it's only polish , shipping to poland. | It's in polish. Stupid sice I got redirected from a Romanian site... | The app is in polish. Learn English! | The app is in Polish with no option to change (or not that intuitive for no Polish speakers). | The app language can be changed to english or romanian (it can be difficult cause the app language is pol). What i dont understand is why do you force me to update the app and cannot use is at it is, and update it after. By blocking the use of app without an update makes me unconfortable. | I installed the app but it is in..Polish?!? Even though I accessed the app from a website in Romanian | Is not functional | Bez zgody na wysyłanie spamu przez Modivo i partnerow handlowych nie można założyć konta :/ Trudno, odinstalowalam appkę. | The website in Bulgaria offers you to install the app in order to qualify for discounts, the app has only a version in polish and unless you understand the language there is no way to change it to English, let alone Bulgarian. This is a huge miss on Modivo's part, check which countries you can support before investing in a marketing that sends people to your app. Waste of time | The app won't start at all. When I try to open it, I get a blank screen, after which it closes by itself | i cannot change the language cause i dont understand in first place | Само бял екран! | You can't change the language.

Useless app | There is NO way to change the app language to English or other language. Uninstalling... | The app is in polish, i cannot change the language, modivo you are a complete fail. | everything is right but i can't with this filters and searching options. Pls fix it. I'm searching jeans and don't have results | The app is designated for Poland only. I don't understand the language. | Can't change the language | How to work with the app, when it's only in polish 👎 | Please make English language translation available at least | The app is unusable as the only language supported is polish.. | Polish language cannot be changed | To change language after installation go to.. Ustawienia aplikacji - Kraj -Zmień - Greece | I can't install it in Bulgarian or even in English, so basically it's not useful for me at all... Shame! | On the Modivo website (RO) you get sent to the app to access a promotion they are running. App is in Polish. Contacted Modivo on Facebook, they said I should go to the app settings. Everything is in Polish, I don't believe the app supports other languages. Dissapointed. | Had an ad in Bulgarian prompting me to install the app. The app is in another language that I cannot change and is practically unusable to order anything. Don't do ad campaigns leading to the app if its going to be completely unusable. | If you are not fluent in Polish, do not install the app. | First provide option to change language to English then ask for feedback.. I see many users gave same feedback.. may be every review feedback is just ignored!! 😂 | Only polish really? | Change the language you Modivo idiots.

Jako divak a poplatnik nemate kde,zanechat verejne hodnoceni. To je chyba nebo mozna zamer | very good. yet please arrange rights in order all archive to be avaliable Europe-wide | Optimalizace by se vždy hodila ale takhle super přehledné | Very good instead of usual TV set | Funguje vcelku dobře, ale jeden zásadní problém tu je. Nelze zvolit zvukovou stopu. A toto nejde nastavit ani v hbbtv aplikaci. Takže tentýž pořad má v mobilu anglickou zvukovou stopu, kdežto v televizi českou. | Příjemné UX/UI, aplikace je krásně responsivní a svižná, vývojová společnost, narozdíl od ostatních (ehm ehm O2), ví co dělá a je to znát. | Dobře zpracovaná aplikace, přehledná a je zde opravdu na co koukat! 😀 Vřele doporučuji | Seriály a všecko super, ale proč tak dlouho trvá načítání pořadů? A mým internetem to opravdu není, jelikož to nenačte ani mobilní 4G😆 | Very best mix of programs. But please make all possible and impossible to offer archive programs of CT to the world outside Czech Republic at least in EU. | Sleduji Události přes aplikaci ale poslední dobou už nejde se podívat jen na vybrané reportáže. Musíte si to pustit celé a případně odhadem přeskakovat pokud se chcete dostat na něco konkrétního. | registration keeps failing | Neustále bufferuje bez ohledu na zvolenou kvalitu. A ne, internet mám dost rychlý. | - impossible registration - I already made a contact over the email, however still waiting for response from app tech team 😕 | Hele jo docela v pohodě apka jo. AKORÁT.....EXISTUJE JEDINEJ...JEDINEJ DŮVOD proč se dá v kalendáři nebo ""podle data"" listovat jen o 14 dní zpět??????? Je to asi detail ale mě docela dost schází | Novej design se dost povedl. Zatim sem zadniu chybycku nenasel. Jen tak dal! :) Aplikaci používám každý den. Mám ji opravdu rád. | živé vysílání nejde streamovat do Chromecast zařízení. | ynot abe to move within app. badly design app. wasted public money by management of czech tv | Apka je vcelku super, jen mě štve, že si nepamatuje připojenou televizi přes Google Cast a musím ji znovu nastavovat pro každý pořad, který pouštím. Nejvíc to vadí u seriálů. | Neda se skrolovat pri pouziti dalkoveho ovladani ani pres bluetooth klavesnici kdyz to mam na android TV.... Proc bych to psal kdyby to neslo?! Vsechny ostatni appky funguji jak s dalkacem i s klavesnici. | Thank you. This app is what i need | I wanted to watch the president duel but the app won't let me. Stupid | Moc rada bych ohodnotila lepe, protoze CT miluju, ale aplikace na Android TV nefunguje. Buffering kazdych par minut takze nekoukatelne. App na Windows Microsoft ani nenaskoci hlavni stranka, pouze se nacita. Internetovou rychlosti to neni, vsechny ostatni streamovaci sluzby mi funguji jak maji. Je problem, ze chci koukat v US? | nejde sdílet odkaz na vybraný pořad | I'm so happy I can download it on a smart TV! We brought our TV from the USA and we weren't able to connect the TV cable to it so we couldn't watch Czech TV, but now we can. | App is now available for SMART TV as well. Happy to use it in phone as well as in TV. | wish I could download | Problems with Android TV/Box , mouse and scroll not suported, remote control doesnt work as well. | Mohu poprosit o featuru ohledně zvuku. V mém zařízení je slyšet zvuk pouze když je puštěn jako ""speaker"". Ocenil bych, kdyby byla možnost pustit ""pouze zvuk"" jako speaker | Aplikace konečně vypadá jak z tohoto století, díky za to. Ještě je potřeba do přehrávače přidat přepnutí na landscape mode. | Fine overall, but tablet layout lacks the three-dot icon with back in time and audio-only options. Please fix (or better bring back in time function to the player itself as on web and hbbtv). | Ocenil bych možnost přepínání audio stopy u vícejazyčných pořadů. Např. Hyde Park Civilizace neumožňuje přehrání v originálním znění v případě zahraničního hosta. Jinak dobrá aplikace. | ""Pouze zvuk"" je k dispozici od verze 3.0.2 | Chromecast se mi podařilo připojit jednou a poté už ne. Na TV vidím pouze logo České televize, aplikace mi hlásí, že streamuje, ale video jede pouze na telefonu. U všech ostatních aplikaci Chromecast funguje na jedničku. Ale aspoň se neseká co pět vteřin jako webové iVysílání. | Funkční ale zoufale nevybavené. Určitě byse hodila možnost nastavení hlasitosti a jasu přimo z přehrávaneho videa. Tmavší filmy jsou nekoukatelné. | Na TV boxe s Android-om 7.1.2 nefunguje v aplikacii posuvanie, teda scrolling obrazovky. Takto nie je absolutne mozne si pozriet inu ako 1. cast nejakeho serialu al. dokumentu. K dalsim castiam sa totiz neda nijak teraz dostat takze aplikacia je v tejto novej verzii nepouzitelna! Stara apka fungovala. Dakujem za opravu tohoto neprijemneho problemu. | hruza | Příšerná aplikace, není možné vybrat rozlišení videa, nelze přehrávat pouze zvuk, rozhraní aplikace je možné používat pouze na výšku atd atd.... Zatím nic moc teda. | Už jen umožnit stahování pořadů a bude to bezchybné. 4/5 | Apka mi schodi video prehravač pro všechny ostatní aplikace, pokud selže přehrávání v Čt app, potom už nejde ani YouTube nebo podobné apky. Pomůže jen restart telefonu. | Nechápu proč ČT (za peníze koncesionářů a daňových poplatníků) hodila z okna fungující aplikace a přišla s novými co se musí ještě dlouho ""postupně vylepšovat"" aby vůbec fungovaly. Přehrávání nefunguje jak má, ergonomie je jen cizí slovo, hledání v programu nefunguje, případně mi to nabízí seznam pořadů pěkně už od roku 2008, ... to ani nemluvím o aplikacích pro ČT sport atd. Někdo si na tom sakra dobře namastil kapsy (malá domů za pár mega, co) ale použitelné to moc není a asi dlouho nebude. | Aplikace umí pouze přehrávat obsah. Ocenil bych další funkce jako třeba uložení pořadu/dílu do oblíbených, zobrazení pořadů na mapě atd. | používám aplikaci na média box kde je k dispozici pouze klávesnice a myš. bohužel po posledním ""velkým"" updatu není možné aplikaci používat jelikož neodporuje myš a není možno navigovat ani klávesnici. | Nová aplikace v mém případě vůbec nefunguje,tedy videa po spuštění play vůbec nehrají,a to ani živé vysílání ani ze záznamu....jen černá obrazovka | After the update you can only use the video player.. The app is therefore almost useless because you can start the video player from any browser from your website.. Why would I need an app for that? The benefit of the app was that you could only listen to audio with your screen off.. By taking away this possibility, you have made the app useless.. | Prosím, ať je apka k dispozici i pro zařízení Google TV. Edit: na mobilu fajn, jen když ji pouštím naležato (třeba v držáku, nebo na stole), tak se to asi 3x přetočí tam a zpět (s mobilem nehýbám). Chtělo by to veškeré obrazovky mít pro oba režimy (portrét, naležato). | 1. Při přehrávání videa jsou po stranách rušivé modré plochy, kterými aplikace vyplňuje nevyužitý prostor, což je obzvlášť nepříjemné u tmavých scén. 2. Absence oblíbených pořadů. 3. Absence nastavení konkrétní kvality videa. 4. Absence nastavení jasu a hlasitosti. 5. Absence automatického překlopení na šířku v případě, kdy má telefon deaktivované automatické otáčení, což v původní verzi fungovalo. 6. Absence funkce zoom, aby video využilo celou plochu displeje. | U can't choose quality/bitrate of stream, there is no ""audio only"" option for ČT24, so no control over data usage - therefore for me almost unusable. | Takhle to dopadá když design ui dementi a projektový imbecil zvítězí nad racionálním uvažování. Startovací verze? Ksindl jak si někdo dovolí vypustit mezi lidi aplikaci bez funkcí z veřejných peněz. Ksindl neskutečný, usilovně pracujete? Běžte d o p r del e šmejdi (chybí moje pořady, v seznamu dílů není datum vydanit dílů atd,) nemusíte ani odpovídat nějakou trapnou odpovědí, hodnocení vyšší nikdy nebude, chování zm e tk ů | Není tam možnost uložit si mezi oblíbené. | Vyborně! | Takhle zmastit fungujici aplikaci...vratte radsi starou verzi. Vzdyt to vubec nefunguje, nejde scrollovat, seka se to. proste fuj | Aktualizaci 2.0.0 mám instalovanou jen několik hodin ale jsem nadšený. Zlepšení je markantní! Konečně všechno funguje jak má. | Nice | super | Aplikace funguje, ale chybí klíčova vlastnost picture-in-picture. | Nefunguje, ostuda. To programoval imbecil. | Dnes nefunguje vůbec. Jen se točí a točí. A dnes, 18. 1. 2021 nefunguje chromecast, jen se točí a točí a pak už nic. Děkuji za obnovení Chromecastu! Dnes 4. 2., nelze spustit aplikaci vůbec, není funkční ani HbbTV, ale možná je chyba na našich telefonech, televizích, tabletě a počítačích a nebo vodafone sítích. | Tak už zase nefunguje přehrávání na chromecast. Že by chyba někde na backendu? | Nefunguje streaming do Chromecast. Plánujete opravdu? | Dobrý den, bylo by možné rozdělit díly u seriálu na jednotlivé série? Možná je problém jen u mě, ale např. u seriálu Vyprávěj vidím všechny díly naházené do jednoho seznamu (navíc bez číslování), takže se v tom opravdu nedá vyznat. Jinak Chromecast funguje skvěle a v podstatě nemám co vytknout, aplikace se mi líbí. Děkuji. PS: Dočítám se v dalších recenzích, že se snad chystá nová mobilní a i TELEVIZNÍ aplikace? Cool! 😎 | Seká se obraz na Anddroid 11, Lenovo P11 Pro. Evidentně problém kodeku. Wifi 80Mb je v pořádku. Ostatní apky (eurosport, netflix, hbo go, youtube) jsou v pořádku. Udělejte s tím něco, nedá se na to koukat. | Při volbě přehrávání pouze audia vždy po několika minutách přehrávání selže. | Opět snižuji hodnocení na jednu hvězdičku. Stream se přerušuje zhruba co půl hodiny, nedokáže navázat, a teď pro jistotu přestal casting fungovat úplně. Kde můžu zrušit ty vaše idiotské koncesionářské poplatky? | nejsou titulky | Perfektní aplikace. Vše funguje jak má. Vyhledám z téměř nekonečného seznamu pořadů a přes Chromecast odešlu do televize. Je to rychlejší a pohodlnější než přes červené tlačítko v samotné televizi. Díky ČT! A námět pro další vývoj vidím ve vyhledávání v názvech pořadů pomocí tři prvních písmen. Dostupných pořadů je tolik, že první dvě písmena na to nestačí. | Hned jak jsem si appku stahla tak ji zase odinstaluji. Pri hledani dilu serialu mi to stale laguje a vraci se to na puvod stranku. Je mnohem jednodussi si to pustit na webu. | masakr, neustale se seka na chromecastu (tak 1-2x za minutu) je to tak otravne a skoro nekoukatelne, neni to netem, netflix, youtube se nesekne ani jednou, hnus | Pro změnu živé přehrávání nefunguje... | Byla by super podpora Android TV | Bude někdy verze pro Android TV? | Don't knoey | Aplikace při přehrávání pořadu - konkrétně Objektiv z 21.2.2021, opakovaně přehrávání zastavuje a točí se načítání. Stejný problém se objevil i u jiných pořadů. Pořad sleduji přes Chromecast na TV. V minulosti to fungovalo, nyní zlobí. Chromecast 2 | Na Samsung Tab S7+ hlásí, že se nemůže připojit s serveru. Reinstal nepomohl.... | Does not work at all | Je tam dobrá snaha, ale dokonalé to není. Overlay tlačítek nemusí být tak tmavý a jeho timeout může být poloviční. Uživatel to zvládne. | U živého vysílání a při přehrávání většiny videí dostanu jen oznámení: ""Litujeme, tento obsah není kvůli omezeným autorským právům dostupný na vašem území"". Vím ovšem že je možné zpřístupnit tv ze zahraničí lidem s trvalým pobytem v České republice. Stačí ověřit totožnost a přihlásit se. Prosím zapracujte na tom. Krom toho Evropskou unii nepovažuji za zahraničí. | Padá audio ct24, android 9 i 10. | skvela apka, ale od posledniho updatu (spis androidu) nejde obraz u zadneho streamu ČT (tablet lenovo..) please fix | proc je update na verzi 1.9.3 driv v huawei app galerii a tady v google play stale neni? | Po zapnuti videa aplikace dlouho nacita a pak vzdy spadne. Nefunguje. | Poorly designed and programmed, quite a lot of flaws, sometimes it just can’t even run...waste of money for ČT | Pravdepodobne je to ucel, ale stve me, ze pripadny screenshot je vycerneny | Vse se nacita prilis dlouho, nelze nijak filtrovat a neni oznaceny obsah, ktery nelze prehrat. ""Film/serialy.. "" neni zanr. Chybi jakykoliv popisek u videi jako zanr, reziser, herci, rok vzniku, zeme puvodu atd. Naprosto nepouzitelna aplikace, ktera vypada jak nedokonceny amatersky projekt. | Velmi nespolehliva aplikace | Nejspíši super kdyby šlo nechat běžet přehrávání na pozadí a / nebo v plovoucím okně. S přehráváním pouze v režimu celé obrazovky pro mě nepoužitelné. | Stream zive se zasekava po kazdych 15 minutach. | Aplikace už je několik let v podstatě stejná, možná by stálo za úvahu redesignovat. Když hledám něco, co v iVysílání není, neukáže se mi nic. Očekával bych alespoň nějakou hlášku typu ""Tohle tady není"". Fajn by bylo zobrazování částí pořadů (např. V Událostech oddělit na timeline jednotlivé reportáže formou kapitol - jako je to na webu). Celá aplikace je na výšku, přehrávání je na šířku - mělo by se umožnit používat aplikaci v obou rozvrženích. Pořady 4:3 jsou roztaženy na 16:9. | Permanentne prerusuje stream, nie je mozne ani 10 minut pozerat v kuse. Po preruseni vysielania casto nie je mozne pokracovat. | Live video freezing every 2-3 munutes | Za tohle platím? | Does not run chyba pripojeni k serveru | K nicemu. Nefunguje na sirku, ale pouze na vysku! / Useless app. Doesn't work in landscape mode. Only portrait mode is available! | Aplikace není podporována na FireOS | Chybi podpora pro Chromecast | Prehravani se obcas prerusi. Aplikace oznami chybu prehravani a zepta se, jestli se ma pokusit spustit znovu. Neslo by toto provest automaticky? To jak je to ted, je velmi uzivatelsky neprivetive. | chyba v prehravani (samsung android 9). nefunguje zive ani ze zaznamu... drive fungovalo. | Proč není aplikace pro android TV ? | Už bylo na čase. Funguje to báječně. Staré chyby jsou již opravené. Jsem závislý na vysílání ČT když jsem dlouhodobě v zahraničí... Výběr programů a nahrané pořady pomalu roste. Některé pořady jsou zablokované bohužel kvůli autorským právům mimo území Česka. | Aplikace pri vysilani skrz chromecast pada. U samsungu s9 se ani neotevre. | Při sledování živého vysílání stream pravidelně každých cca. 10 - 15 minut havaruje - zčerná obrazovka a vypadne zvuk. Je nutno se vrátit zpět do seznamu kanálů a spustit znovu. Děje se bez ohledu na rozlišení. Při sledování z archivu se problém nevyskytuje. Telefon Asus Zenfone 6, aktuální Android 10. | Vidím aplikaci, říkám si, hurá, můžu sledovat Českou TV z ciziny, pak přišlo zklamání, buď chybová hláška nebo ""litujeme, tento obsah není kvůli omezeným autorským právům dostupný na vašem území"" ...tak to odinstaluju, sbohem | Uprostřed vysílání se mně přehrávání seklo a hotovo. Stejně se mně zdají ty servery líné v porovnání s Youtube, O2 TV nebo Kuki TV. ČT je nejdražší placená TV. | Nejsem si jista, ze jste odstranili chybu v prehravani. At se snazim jak se snazim. Videa mi prehrat nelze. | Chromecast funguje jen pri streemu poradu z archivu, live nefunguje | Chromecast doesn't work! | Po aktualizaci aplikace, přestalo fungovat sdílení na Chromecast, ale vývojářům se to podařilo opravit. | Chromecast streaming stop working. Pls fix. | The Chromecast casting is broken, probably from latest update | Jak je možné že do ČT teče každý rok 7 miliard (možná trochu méně či více) a za celou dobu nikdo nedokáže zprovoznit alespoň jak se říká u politiků alespoň trochu ""důstojnou"" aplikaci pro Android či iPhone? | Aplikace po aktualizaci nepřehraje žádné video, respektive hned skočí nakonec. Vymazání dat pomohlo, ale s tím se nepřekvapivě smazaly i moje pořady 😕 jak píší ostatní, chromecast též nefunguje a intenzivní práce na opravě snad nemůže trvat dva týdny. | Spokojenost | Od posledni aktualizace nejde spustit zadny porad. Ano, u poradu z archivu se prehraje reklama a potom se zobrazi pouze nefunkcni 'tlacitko' ""Prehrat znova"" na cernem pozadi. Pri spusteni online vysilani v realnem case pouze rovnou nefunkcni 'tlacitko' ""Play livestream"" na cernem pozadi (zarizeni nastaveno na jazyk EN). UPDATE: Po preinstalaci funguje jako drive, 4*. | Po posledni aktualizaci nejdou prehravat zadna videa. Ani odninstalovani a opetovne nainstalovani nepomohlo. 😏 | Přestalo fungovat přehrávání přes Chromecast, ostatní aplikace problém nemají, tzn.chyba je v iVysílání | Po poslednim update se spusti jen reklama a pozadovane video pak uz ne. Minimalne u ""Udalosti"" tento stav trva uz nekolik dni. | Aplikace přestala zcela komunikovat s google chromecast a zlobí i při přehrávání. Hlavně, že se v ní objevily reklamy před videem. | Po poslední aktualizaci nejsem schopný sledovat žádný pořad, vidím jen černou obrazovku a tlačítko Přehrát znovu. Na druhém mobilu (stejný model) přehrávání videí funguje, ale nejde streamovat na Chromecast. | Po poslední aktualizaci se přehrají reklamy na začátku a pořad skočí rovnou na konec a zeptá se jestli chci přehrát pořad znovu. Ano chci, reklama a jedeme dokola. Děkuji za přehrávač jedné reklamy... | Kde je Interview s V. Láskou 26.9.? | Nefunguje: ""Nepodarilo se prehrat"" na vse. Bez jakehokoliv vysvetleni. | Sranec Nefunguje | totalne nepouzitelny, aplikace spadne vzdy pri kliknuti na Dalsi dily. Nefunguje vyhledavani podle datumu - tvari se ze se nacetl vybrany den, ale program je porad stejny. Pri rozkliknuti dalsiho dilu v nejakem serialu z programu se prehrava ten samy, testoivano na Nemocnicnii na kraji mesta | Everything just shows ""not available in your country"". What was that about geoblocking in EU being illegal? Being abroad was the only reason I installed the app. | Port 554 forwardovaný nemám, jak bych taky mohl mít, když mám doma 3 smartphony a tři počítače. Přesto to manželce na archaickém HTC Desire na androidu 2.3 funguje. Mě nikdy nefungovalo na těchto telefonech: HTC Legend, HTC Wildfire, HTC Desire s ICS 4.0. Nyní mi to zázrakem funguje na Nexus S s Androidem 4.2, ale nefunguje na ZTE Blade. Jak to, že to na Windows PC vždycky funguje, i když není forwardovaný port? | Aplikace spadne, kdykoli uživatel zvolí režim Pouze zvuk. Takto se to chová už dlouho. Užívám Android 8.0 a 8.1... | oki | Přestala fungovat funkcionalita ""Živě"" - objeví se jen černá/tmavá plocha. Nepoužitelné. Opravte prosím! | Chromecast obrazovka potřebuje tlačítka na posun vzad a vpřed o 10s!! | Aplikace konečně podporuje Chromecast, což je skvělý krok kupředu. Nicméně stále postrádám jednoduchý management oblíbených seriálů, rozdělení sérií nebo jasný přehled toho, co už jsem viděl (případně na kolikáté minutě skončil). Stále je co dohánět v porovnání s aplikacemi HBO, Netflix nebo Prime Video, ale krok kupředu je znát a je příjemný. Díky !!! | Není možné přehrávání pozastavit nebo přejít na jinou pozici. V takovém případě se přehrávání už znovu nerozbehne a musím ho pustit znovu od začátku. To dělá aplikaci téměř nepoužitelnou.(Lenovo p70a v4.4.4 KitKat) | Nedokáže seřadit díly podle času vysílání. | No need for TV with this app ♥️ | Mimo ČR nelze spustit téměř nic. Opět nenažraná a neschopna zřídit uživatelské účty - Česka televize! | Jsem v Canade a zkousel jsem Vas app, ale nefunguje autorske zamezeni. Karel | Fullscreen obraz posunutý dolů, není celý na výšku. Zoufalost... | to je skvele ze ct pridala zive vysilani ale pri spusteni libovolneho poradu aplikace okamzite pada.... k nicemu! | Konečně chromecast. | K čemu to živé vysílání je, když se nemůžu na ČT1 podívat ani na hlavni zpravodajskou relaci v 19:00? Odinstalace. | Konečně redesingn.... Nějak nechápu funkci fullscreen a její praktičnost ... Chybí propojení s účtem na webu ... Chybí ukládání postupu u pořadů | Konečně podporuje chromecast | Jedna hvezda za to, ze to kdysi slo spustit na chvili ... | Nefunguje zvuk | Chybí podpora pro Chromecast | Bez Chromecastu, co je smysl? | Great | Super, že aplikace vůbec existuje! Chybí filtr pořadů dostupných pro přehrávání. Chybí základní textový popis o pořadu - o čem ten který pořad (video) je.  Edit: Neexistuje fulltext vyhledávání, nelze přehrát pořady z olympiády,...za půl roku stále stejné tragické UI i ovládání. | Tragická aplikace!!! Nestabilní, nespolehlivá a uživatelsky zcela nepřívětivá. Udělejte s tím něco!!!! | Pořady o olympiádě nejdou přehrát, prý se nepodařilo připojit k serveru. Přitom žádný request ani nebyl proveden. Navíc archivní pořady ale přehrát jdou, takže problém bude někde jinde.  Dnes už standardní podpora Chromecastu chybí - v televizi si sice můžu pustit živé živé vysílání, ale někdy si chci něco přehrát z archivu - proč to nenabídnout?  UX/UI by zasloužilo přepracovat, aplikace je na androidu, tak podle toho má vypadat. Standardní elementy, způsob navigace atd. Proč to psát od nuly, když existují zavedené, osvědčené způsoby? | Chybí podpora Chromecast, to je ovšem dost možná záměr. UI je příšerné - aplikace pro android bez Google Material Design - to je snad jen recese. Chybí popis jednotlivých videí - není vubec jasné jestli dané video je seriál, večerníček, nebo zprávy. Karta ""související"" vypisuje prapodivné výsledky | Kedy bude podpora Chromecastu? | Vypsani seznamu programu a najdeni poradu co chci chce pevne nervy a dost casu. Nejspis nevhodne implementovano, nedoreseno, neoptimalizovano. | poslední update je prů*** - vždyť se to vůbec nevejde na obrazovku a tlačítka pro přidání do oblíbených, výběr předchozích dílů.. nejsou dostupná  ??? (S7/S8+ HD/FHD i WQHD)  missing Multi-Window Support :( Např. na S7 jdou aplikace (YouTube atd.) zmenšit do malého on-top okna, takže mohou běžet zároveň s navigací, nebo při libovolné jiné aktivitě - což u TV je samozřejmě velmi zajímavá vlastnost. | Does not support Chromecast (or smart TVs). | To se mi libi | Dobrý, ale bez chromecast je to jen znouzectnost. | To je ale nepovedena aplikace... | Dostupnost pořadu se divák dozví teprve poté, když se ho pokusí přehrát. To je asi česká specialita. Proč nemůže být v menu jenom to, co je aktuálně dostupné? | Chybí podpora pro Chromecast | Nový přehrávač stále není dotažený do konce. Nedostatky: 1) Při prohlížení programů vysílaných na jednotlivých stanicích během dne se scrolluje vždy jen sloupeček jednoho kanálu, což je velmi nefektivní/otravné. 2) Přechod na datum pořadu z kalendáře nefunguje správně (sobota 14. ledna 2017 se zobrazuje jako 13. leden). Po vybrání data (sobota 13. ledna) se neaktualizuje horizontální výpis dat v týdnu a není vidět správný program pro tento den. 3) Videa se ihned po vstupu na detail pořadu spouštějí (zbytečně mi zatěžuje data, když se chci jen podívat na detaily pořadu). 4) Obtížně se přetáčí vpřed a vzad (vlivem nepřesnosti dotyku nejsem schopen udělat prstem přesné krátké přetočení; horší u delších videí). | Promeskana prilezitost. Zastarale UI a zadna Chromecast​ podpora | Zastaralé UI a video se dá přetáčet jen když se aplikaci chce. | nebetycny paskvil. nepouzitelne, odinstalovano po minute. | Bude nekdy podporovat chromecast? | Hrozně vypadá, ještě hůře se ovládá a chybí základní funkce. A taky podpora pro Chromecast. Příšerný zmetek. | chyba podpora pre chromecast | Chromecast by tuhle aplikaci přineslo na úplně jinou úroveň | Prosim o podporu chromecast | Podpora chromcast chybí proto jen 4 hvězdy | chybí mi podpora chromecastu 🤔 | Aplikace je uzivatelsky mnohem prijemnejsi na pouzivani nez ostatni ct aplikace, skoda, ze chybi chromecast. | Nefunguje s Chromecast | Lze volit programy, zastavovat a spouštět, seek - posunutí taky funguje a změna kvality videa rovněž. Zatím spokojenost. | Nefunguje, nepřehrává video ani po aktualizaci. Funguje mi pouze prohlížeč s flashem na přehrávání obsahu z iVysilani. Ostuda ČT? Řekl bych, že ano! | Rubbish | Soustavné padání streamu, které způsobuje absolutní nepoužitelnost aplikace. | Po půl roce to konečně funguje normálně . | pridala som si viac programov do oblubenych, aby som si ich neskor pozrela a appka zacala padat. otvorim, idem do oblubenych, zacnu sa nacitavat a okamzite to padne. ocenila by som aj moznost niekde oznacit oblubenu relaciu, nie iba diely. | Skvely obsah, ktery nelze vysilat do TV pres Chromecast, tak jako u spousty konkurencnich aplikaci. Na co tedy je??? | Nechapu proc to nefunguje v zahranici | Poslední update konečně umožňuje přehrávat video bez zasekávání. | Super, funguje skvele, jen pridejte podporu Chromecast | Od poslední aktualizace se obraz už jen seká, nelze nic sledovat. Škoda že si to neumí načíst dopředu a pak spustit... | Good appka | neustale pada | Dobra applikace, jenom je skoda, ze v zahrani ci nejde prehrat spoustu programu. | A take je mezi prvky chybne definovan focus.

I reinstalled apps and widget is still on bad shape. | Po posledním update nefunguje widget. | Nová appka vypadá skvěle! | Pokud někomu nejde widget v nové verzi ať apku odinstaluje a nainstalujte znova,.vše ok | hmm widget stal uz predtim za prd... ale po updatu nebyl videt... po odebrani a pridani cant load widget a konec... mozna by bylo super zapracovat na velikosti.. protoze na obrazovce se to vejde uplne na prd... co se tyce vyuziti mista 2x3... stejny mozna vetsi problem s velikosti ma bohuzel i aladin... mno snad se ro zlepsi grafika v nahledu vypada lepe.... ale nejde update: po reinstalu ok. i nastaveni widgetu se zda lepsi nez bylo. tak jeste aladina widget poladit | Another uglification project. You really think this ""redesign* would impress anybody? Downgraded and frozen the app to never update again. It still works, that'a why it's not 1* (i hate when dev is enforcing new bs design whem the old was sufficient) | Was bugged after update, reinstall helped and seems to be working nice now | Great app, been using it for years. The redesign is great. Had to reinstall the app to fix new widget loading (deleting app data didn't help). | Finally! New widget what work even on android 11! New design! Thanks! | Funguje skvele, ale novy design je humus.... Nechapu proc jsou vsichni na vetvi z tehle radoby moderne vypadajicich nesmyslu. Aspon kdyby widget vypadal stejne, ty novy jsou fakt hnus. A totez ikona. Jeste ze se da nainstalovat stara verze. A ted jdu zalohovat soucasnou verzi Aladina, protoze pocitem ze ho brzo zmrsite stejnym zpusobem. | Je to skvela a uzitecna mapka, nicmene ma obcasne problemy s funkcnosti widgetu. Na priklad nyni po posledni aktualizaci. Pomohla odinstalace a reinstalace. Pokud by se nekdo potykal s podobnym problemem. | IT used to link to Aladin module. Not aby Linger. What a Shane. | Moc krásně předělaná verze 4.0.13 z října 2020! Tak ještě teď Aladina, prosím. S UV indexem. | Snad jediná aplikace s pořádaným widgetem! Nová verze se povedla... | Vypadá výborne | Skvělý nový UI. líbí se mi - praktická dostupnost ostatních appek, možnost přepnutí podkladové mapy. Dobrá práce. | Nový dizajn dizajn potešil. Super vec mať vlastný radar na mobile resp. prístup naň. | Was great app. Untill the last update | Poznámky k verzi 4.0.10 z 22/10/2020: - jak nastavit vlastni pozice a nezobrazovat pozici radaru? predchozi verze to umela v nastaveni; - jak zakazat zobrazovani animace predpivedi? v v predchozi verzi to slo zakazat nastaveni. Diky | Long time user, the redesign looks great! | Why can't be installed without location permissions?? | Aktualizací bylo trhání opraveno, už jede vše plynule. | Nový design je moc pěkný a už bylo na čase ho aktualizovat, ovšem na Oneplus 8 Pro s Android 11 aplikace nefunguje (nenačítá data o srážkách, nefunguje pohybování se po časové ose). | App redesign a šup 3 nová oprávnění a ani slovo o nich. Nefér! EDIT 2020-10-01 Výborně tedy o tom ani nevíte nebo netušíte? Vidím to stejně na Android 9 i 10: NOVÉ spuštění služeb na popředí, bránění přechodu telefonu do režimu spánku a Play Install Referrer API | Radar nemusí ukazovat vždy přesně. Ale používam společně s aplikací počasí abych měl okolo sebe přehled. | Genialne jednoduche. Skoda, ze neobsahuje informace o blesku. | Na Galaxy S10 se nezobrazuje mapový podklad, takže netuším na jak velké území se koukám. Chtělo by aktualizaci pro nové Androidy... | Great app... I use it many years. Unfortunately on Samsung S20+ widget doesn't work correctly. | Widgets don't work on my pixel 4 | Not showing any data for more than two weeks. | Not reliable even 10 minutes ahead. Sometimes, you look at it, it's supposed to rain but it doesn't. | V poslední době zcela nesmyslné a nespolehlivé předpovědi teploty i srážek. | Only positive about this app. | Perfektna | Skvela aplikace, ale bohuzel widget je na novejsich verzich Androidu casto neviditelny. Prosim autory o opravu. | It's really useful when you want to know sth about weather in first 20-30 minutes, cuz then it's accurate,but when you want to know weather in 2-3 hours, you will be surprised, because if you don't pay for it, as free app you're able to see only what will happen in first 50 minutes. Of course when you'll see some dark clouds in another country and it will head for your country, you still will know when it beat your home, but it can change its way fast and disappear, so then it's not so accurate. | Widget has still issues after update to Android 10 @Samsung s10e :( Usually it is not visible at all. | Jedna z nejspolehlivějších aplikací. Jednoduchá, čistá, užitečná. Ještě mě nezklamala. Vždy fungovala zcela spolehlivě. A to na několika zařízeních :) | Výborný, ale po posledním update (asi na android 10) Samsung 9 widget přestal fungovat. Snad dojde k aktualizaci. | It seems there are no actual radar data since about three weeks ago. Or is it only me who can't see them? | Beznadějně zastaralé, nefunkční a nepoužitelné (Android 10). | Is there a europe module for this, or only czech republic? | Widget nefunguje na android 10 | Update: Skvelá aplikácia pre CZ. Zo všetkých vyskúšaných sa ovláda najlepšie. Škoda, že je len pre CZ. | Why there is no radar data recently? | 😊 | Useless - data not accurate at all not even for the current time (I'm not even talking about forcast - even couple of hours ahead). | Cant install this app | It is pity that the app only show the Czech Republic and does not work abroad.  I love the widget and the finger scroll thru time | Good app but sometimes doesn't work - not showing data even if it's obviously storm coming and radar data checked from another source shows something else... , however, it's just for a few last days... | Widget update isn't stable, also often disappear from screen. | widget not working on android 9 :-( | Po updatu na android 8 mizí widget. | Just works as expected. | Radar pěkný, aplikace funguje výborně. Škoda že data jsou teď z nějakého celoevropského obrázku v obdélníkovém výřezu, myslím že ta 2 kolečka kolem radarů v Brdech a v Bukové pro mě byla užitečnější, bylo vidět dál do Rakouska. A ještě bych si k vánocům přál blesky, mapa už tam je, tak to nebude těžký.. Díky. | Great app, however widget doesnt work properly on Android 8.1. | Not available in my area | Dneska mraky na obloze ale zadne na radaru :-( | Simple app with great source of radar data. Please add at least 24 hours 
history of radar images in order to be able to know whether there was a 
rainfall in previous hours. 12 images is only last 2 hours, which is 
tragically short timespan. Thank you in advance! | Mapa nefunguje ani po aktualizaci,  vidím jen mapquest tiles not available | Bohuzel ukazuje obcas značně neaktualni data ze stare predpovedi (i po aktualizaci). Dnes venku aktualne 4 stupne a aplikace tvrdi pres 10 :-( | Widget nefunguje na Android Oreo. Jako ryhly workaround staci nastavit na /data/user/0/org.androworks.meteor a podadresare pristupova prava pro zapis a cteni libovolnym uzivatelem (nezapomente na X bit pro slozky). Vice v logcatu. | Widgets do not work on Android Oreo. | Useknuté mapy zhora aj zdola. Cez WEB stránku je to vporiadku. PREČO???? Ináč by to bolo O.K. | Useknute mapy pre Sk. Na oreu je veľmi nestabilná a vyzerá že update je v nedohľadne. Treba prejsť na niečo iné. | I don't like it | Říkali bez reklam, lhali | Důvod, proč je toto pouze pro obdélník kolem ČR jde mimo mě.. pokud se oblačnost pohybuje ze severozápadu a bydlíte v severních Čechách, je vám radar naprosto k *** Jinak ale super aplikace.. | Výborná aplikace | podarena appka, pouzivam aj na kus slovenska :) | Nothing apear on main screen,like wheather.The photos under the Read more links are fake.Only the radar works...sorry jako! | Super | Super. Nešel by prosím přidat widget s měnitelnou velikostí? | ...dokud nevyskočila pop-up reklama přes většinu screenu. Nechutné | Super aplikace, škoda občasných reklam na ostatní aplikace při spouštění. | Aplikace skvělá, jen škoda že zobrazuje jen srážkový radar. Hodila by se i oblačnost (ideálně i dělená nízká střední vysoká). Ale nevím, zda je licence na data z těchto satelitů dostupná. | Velmi užitečná aplikace👍 | Supr | Works vzry Nice | Moc kratky casovy horizont. | Aplikace bezne zobrazuje ze v miste me polohy prsi - neni to v 60% pravda. Nespolehlive. | Perfektni aplikace | Perfektne funguje! Pouzivam ho kazdodenne na ruzne sportovne aktivity | Nice and useful tool | Though it only covers the north of Austria, there is no other app that shows live rain radar maps. | Pecka!! | Pecka | Starts automaticaly with internet every time. Stays in the memory all the time. Cant kill it. Uninstall. | Krátký horizont, ale velmi přesný | Prestalo ukazovat budoucnost. Pls opravit. | Horrible  Does not work will not set the right loacation | Pure Rubbish | Thanks | Sure would be nice if these apps would be specific about where they work and where they don't. It could be the best ever weather app but I'll never know because it doesn't work in North America | Nice app | Would be great if the app could cover at least whole central Europe. | Downloaded this app before going to c Venice and Lake Garda only to discover it does not cover southern Europe. Northern Europe and I suspect. The States (as usual) It will be fine. | Pura verga | Second times applying for Galaxy tablet as first choice. | Všechno funguje. Akorát bacha na transparentní srážky. Stalo se mi, že jsem omylem kliknul na maximální transparency a pak jsem žil 14 dní v tom, že nikde neprší. | But why did you turn off this small piece of Poland?  Now it sucks | good | Od včera prestala ukazovať dáta pre juhozápadné Slovensko :-( a časť Moravy ... (neviem či je to iba náhoda, ale) onedlho po mojom povzdychu sa udiala náprava ... VĎAKA ... Back to 5 stars :-) | Dříve bylo možné sledovat přesnou shodu radaru se skutečným průběhu srážek. V poslední době radar několikrát ukazoval srážky a nedopadla ani kapka. Možná se slabé srážky mohou vypařit ještě nad zemí, ale pak by bylo potřeba takto údaje prezentovat. | Not working at india | Great | why is the USA not on this? Uninstalling its worthless to me. | Drive byla aplikace presnejsi. Aktualne aplikace ukazuje v me lokaci bezny dest az silnejsi srazky (svetle zelena, zluta az oranzova). Ve skutecnosti sviti slunce. :-( | It's the best application for people who's going to ride a bike. I always see before go out. | Simply the best weather forecast app | does not support north america | Don't work for the uk, uninstaling | Už tolikrát mi interpretace dat z radaru zachránila suchou kůži, že nemohu ohodnotit jinak než plným počtem | Nice work | It wouldn't go to ameica | Yes | Great app if you sray in CZ | Skvělá aplikace, idealni na planovani venkovnich aktivit. | Už přes rok čekám na to, kdy si autoři uvědomí přechod na moderní Android UI. Po funkční stránce bez problémů, vzhled je ale ostuda... | Would not work | very goos app.... | Love it! | Super slow | Simply brilliant after the last update. If you are able to convince CHMU or even SHMU to come up with a detailed weather forecast, you deserve 6*! |  | Nefunguje interní mapa. | Po posledním updatu mapa konečně funguje bezchybně, díky! | Hey so it does work for lg optimus ls670 thats alot of info from a pic  have that type of phone | Opravdu velmi uzitece, zvlaste PRI planovani nasich outdoorovych aktivit. | Enough said! | Chybí mi autostart animace a stahovani jiného počtu snímků přes wifi a přes mobilní síť. Taky bych uvítal kdyby se po tuknuti na inkonu aplikace vždy spustil meteoradar a nikoli Aladin,  budj se má jednat o jednu aplikaci, ale pokud jsou samostatné tak toto chování je nejapné. | Nefunguje mi na Androidu 4.0 :-(, na 2.x mi slapala :-/. | radarova data maji nejakou hloupou pruhlednost a zmena nastaveni nic nedela. tak nevim | Slúži presne tak ako má, maximálna spokojnosť! | stupid. | Naprosto perfektní appka | Používám často, ale po update na nové mapy se použitelnost zhoršila. A když už jsem tady : V Meteoru je update jako refresh, v Aladinu jako update. Přidat custom polohu v Meteoru nejde jinak nežli GPS koordináty, v Aladinu si to vyhledá pěkně ze seznamu. | Rychlá a jednoducha... | Must have for everyone in Czech Republic | good | But slow on tablets | Only sometimes even when clouds are on the sky, meteor does not show them. It's for a few days now, seems like some of the rdars are broken or something. Also sometimes images are loaded really slowly even though the Internet connection is good. Otherwise very nice | No language choice No data displayed No weather report | Svuj učel splnil! | That's moor lik it | Nice | very good weather view. I suggest! | However needs a tiny improvements. | Vynikající pro předpověď počasí v ČR. | Super... 100% | Dùng rất hay | Potreba ukazat na delsi dobu dopredu ne jen pul hodiny, predpoved na cely den | Perfected | Mash sain | Only 1 location | Its very good app has much more feature | Vyborna aplikace. Pouzivam ji velmi casto. Aladin model je uzitecny doplnek. Jen mi docela chybi detekce blesku celdn. Bylo by fajn kdyby ji autori pridali. | Well good app, but i hate when apps have the 24 time hours insted of 12 hours. Can you atleast add that in the settings? | It is nice and very clear in india too. Caricaturist Sugumarje | Ideální v kombinaci s Alain modelem | . | Perfect! | Bohužel v poslední verzi přestalo fungovat zobrazení polohy. Na widgetu funguje. | Really useful app! Much better than standard forecasts.. | Ale prestal mi fungovat kompas ikdyz v jinych aplikacich funguje.A zda se, ze radar v Cechach nyni neposkytuje data | Weather forecast program | Na mobilu htc funguje bezproblemove, ale na tabletu bez GPS modulu hlasi chybu aplikace a nelze spustit...mozna fix at neni potrebe gps modul ?:/ | What is this | Občas vidím jak se na mě valí mraky a aplikace nic nezobrazuje.

I MISS RIF SO MUCH | I installed the app and saw there was no way to make the exceedingly tiny font readable within the app, so I uninstalled it after 2 minutes. this app is not usable by anybody with vision problems, and HAS NO ACCESSIBILITY OPTIONS AT ALL! | App sucks more than website | Nice | Not laggy as it used to anymore. | Great app | For several weeks now the app is no longer working. All i'm getting is ""tap to retry"". I have uninstalled and tried to reinstall the app and it's not accepting the credentials yet i can easily connect via browser. I've tried with and without VPN and still nothing. Am i the only one having this issue? | Unlike the other apps reddit shut down, this app doesn't have a ""view all comments"" button, so if you navigate to a comment in a thread, there's no way that I can figure out to navigate to the post. There is no parent button, so you can't even go up a level. Terrible. | Everything is perfect. | The app isn't working and hasn't been for at least a day. That might not be a big deal except Reddit has made it impossible for any other apps to connect to their site without paying a fee. They have also made it impossible to run the mobile version without opening the app unless you uninstall it, because it will open any link through the app, which isn't working. So any time the app is down, like now, the site is inoperable without uninstalling first. Just another way the website is dying. | Slow loading | Terrible app full of trolls and miserable disgusting people everywhere you go or say people will judge you. The world is dying because of stupid people who don't care about others because they think they're big and strong but there not if anyone who sees this review please delete this app now because people will hurt your feelings. People who made reddit should feel ashamed of themselves because of the hate and toxic things people do. This generation terrible I wish humanity was dead | Terrible Terrible Terrible. Can't believe they killed 3rd party apps for this horrible experience. | It's loading for a week now I have tried reinstalling it | Easy to use | It just suddenly stopped working. I was stucking at the loading screen; Re-installed, but I can't even log in now. | Witty and insightful posts. Good and plenty. | Reddit. For years, you don't really need it, until you suddenly do. | Best place for accurate information. | I have just added this app and I'm only starting to learn how to use it! I do enjoy reading the comments. | redit | Who is approving these awful changes? The gestures update was a terrible move. I'm deleting the app. Maybe I'll use the web version instead, but I'm tempted to abandon Reddit entirely. | Works great, pretty seamless UI. Only suggestion I have is to improve notifications. Even after I silence a sub reddit I stumbled upon I still get notifications from it and I don't see any settings for specific sub reddits. Just in general. | Autobanned and no one helped me so now I'm permabanned for no good reason. I won't even be looking at your site anymore: congratulations. | Constantly shows notifications for chats that have already been read or in some cases hidden or deleted/blocked. | I love it but one problem, why can't we delete our inbox messages...? I would love to give 5 stars if that feature is implemented.. | Definitely helpful. A lot of support for people looking for support. To figure out what is unknown. | It needs more improvements like TikTok. | My name is not Mike bresnahan it's James Gretsch so if you could change that | Really happy there's an app for this | Love me some Reddit | It's a great way to get real reviews on just about any product. It end up pulling me in and I read about other topics too. I haven't really got into posting myself though. | U have a Samsung S24 and I was forced to use the browser version of Reddit because I could not get into app, tired resetting data, cleared cache, everything! And I have T-Mobile. The app is garbage, literal. Garbage! I'm not calling T-Mobile when reddit is the one that's having problems. You don't even listen to your costumers! Which is sad. Very very sad. You don't even monitor what's being posted either! This is depressing | Just fix it already, it's unusable. | With the last few updates this app has become nearly useless. It freezes constantly. The UI seems to be different depending on which sub I am in. And it glitches when scrolling through posts. Overall, I am better off reading it in my browser. | Update: new update now makes you click on the post, AND AGAIN ON MORE COMMENTS to read comments Lol POS APP. ""muting"" channel does nothing except reloading to the top of the page. Why release features that don't even work? Half of my posts are ads (not to mention EXTRA LOUD AUTOPLAY) that take up more space than most posts. Terrible experience. | Not Worth. | App not working at all | App is abysmal, inaccessible, and consistently crashes. | This app is great for browsing thousands of communities but it eats a ton of ram, and I'm constantly clearing cache. I'm unable to load more than one photo at a time if at all. I get a ""unable to load photo"" prompt if I'm posting multiple photos. No notifications or suggestions as to which photo or why? I've cropped the photos but nothing works. This app has gone downhill. It's ridiculous and frustrating not to mention sloooow. Did I mention slow? The worst app on my phone | Please allow completely blocking a user = never seeing their posts or comments in subs. | 👍👍👍👍 | Lags like crazy, the scroll ain't smooth | Could u please change where the custom feed is placed. Its annoying | Enjoy variety of content | Still doesn't have half the features/options that nearly every other 3rd party reddit app had. Maybe pay spez more, I'm sure that'll help | Nice community! | Adorable | This gesture update is terrible. | Great app. I ❤️ how the fast app is. Not freezing. I am thankful. | It's vere very cool | I hate this app | Brilliant communities to enjoy fandoms and have thoughtful discussion | Nahh mann | veri nyc app deer 😘 | Good for children. | 2023 dec design is great and is 10x better than new reddit. It made me stop using old reddit and I love it | Amazing | Can't log in no matter what. I get the code sent to me in a text message, I input the code, but it doesn't work. | wow!!!!! | Very nice | So Reddit banned all the good third party apps so they could make more ad money pushing this garbage trash? Unusable, and inserting a sportsbook ad every scroll somehow isn't the worst part. How is it possible to be this bad at mobile? Tapping links rarely works as intended. Goodbye again reddit | Really useful website for advice and sharing 👍 | Most subs are run by jerks. Its pretty annoying. | Keeps crashing and generally sucks | positive and motivating | newest update broke the app 🙃 | 5 stars says it all. | App interface in south Indian languages pls. Should be as popular as Twitter in India. Provide Google/Facebook login. | Love Reddit always get something to amuse me . | The app bearly functions post will open on a delay clicking on a sub will just open an ad post, videos just won't load there's so much just wrong with this app I can't even list it all. To add to my review sometimes while reading comments it acts as though I've tapped on a new post just to show me a single comment when I just touch the screen trying to scroll through the replies. And the new way to view photos is unintuitive and being able to scroll over to a new post is just bad design. | Just doesn't work. At all. | Exceptional | Best scrolling social media app in my opinion. | Good | Has everything you could think of. | Ads are playing automatically and with sound on, on my feed despite autoplay being off. Extremely annoying and will be removing. | A++ | Love it | Best | Great and fun source for information and idea sharing | Nothing will load. Can't log in. Have reinstalled and tried on multiple devices and multiple internet providers. Unable to authenticate. ""Uh-oh"" pop-ups | Reddit also know from where the users he got | Great to find the info I need | Garbage app. The older third party apps were much better. | Good app. | Keeps freezing | The platform was all nice once until users with certain agenda had something to say. This led more hatred towards one nation and biased towards other. False reports, propaganda and irrelevant data are circulating everywhere now. Really can't trust one source. Plus, Reddit does no action against these issues. Western hypocrisy is just too much. | Reddit's not as good as it used to be | Love it... | Yiiip on the tip of a nip... beep beep..it's good for finding out useless cnts opinions. | Worst app out there banning people for no reason can't talk to anyone to actually state your case can't even make a new account because of some stupid evasion ban just power hungry mods | Keep getting lost on it, open up something and the next thing I know it's a hour later, brilliant.. | Shows the real stuff n not censored love it | Fun to read! | The app started to have microlagging on scrolling posts or comments. This doesn't happen when I open the site and browse it in mobile Firefox. I'm on Oreo, XZ1 compact. Not sure when it started. | Absolute life saver 😁 | I love the app on how everyone answers your questions quickly and they are always reliable. | Not able to login | Excellent site for stories | Such an awesome app!! | Fun for all | Always find something to pass the time from local to national | notifications for communities im not even in. couldnt turn them off in the app either. maybe ill get it again if they fix the bugs. | All the things that you didn't know you needed to know. | Fun reads... | Well I have just started but reading a lot of what the people are saying it sounds cool and everyone is very friendly! I believe it will only get better and better. Thanks For Having Me. 😎 | This app has a terrible user interface and the developers don't seem to care about user issues. Moderation is minimal and racist and sexist content is never addressed. Nothing good has ever come from Reddit. | Great 💯 | Honestly I've found it a good alternative to other shortform media platforms since if you click on a video you can scroll. The algorithm could be better but the advantage of it being hands-off (ie terrible) is you mainly get videos from subreddits you've joined. | Out of all the social media platforms Reddit is my go to over all the others | trash unable to authenticate you | Great | This app is great but a interface can be improve i believe the UI UX is little bit difficult to understand for a new user | Go back to the old system. Not intuitive at all. | Ok ish | Love the reddit for gossip. Just don't understand the whole karma system. Can't leave comments on most stuff. Kind of a downer | Used to be great but currently really buggy. Can't see comments and when I get a notification and click it to open it on the app it fails to open | Want an app that crashes within a minute every time you open it? Then this is the app for you! Seriously, this app is borderline unusable with how often it crashes. | Gotta, gotta, get it. | I JUST BOUGHT A NEW PHONE AND CAN'T SIGNINTO MY ACCOUNT ON IT. APP WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE MY ACCOUNT OR EMAIL EVENTHOUGH I looked it up on my PC and both username and email are in my account information. Will not rate until this is resolved | I've used a few mobile apps for reddit over the years and this is by far the worst. I decided to give it a try since the app I used was forced to shut down by reddit. It's honestly almost funny in some weird way that the ""official"" reddit app is the worst. Tried using it for a week, uninstalled. | Stop A/B testing the overflow menu when viewing pictures, the new version is HORRIBLE. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't, figuring it was an A/B test. You shouldn't press a button in the upper right and expect the options to appear at the bottom of the screen. That's just horrible UX | reddit is so bad i just get banned or my posts gets removed all the time it has such silly rules on what you can post on reddits its also so slow sometimes it takes forever to load and the people on reddit aren't actually the nicest people in the world | Great app for educational purposes only | Your recent update to push chat channels nobody asked for has broken the ability to reply to comments. One star until the app us usable again. | Since the last update, clicking on posts has been unusable. The new swipe feature is unnecessary. It used to automatically load the comment section but now I have to tap to load the comments. | Constantly crashes | I don't know how an app can be this bad. Constantly logs me out. automatically scrolls up to the top out of nowhere. Pictures and videos won't load. This app is so bad it blows my mind. | Verry gud | Nice to hear from you | This app is great. It supports every community and could show you anything in your interests, like cartoons, anime, videogames, boxing, and more. | Great | I like that I can get a lot of information on problems I'm trying to solve and have many questions about! It's a good app when it's working correctly! I occasionally have issues with clicking on a reddit subject from Google search and having it link to the app...the specic subject I was searching for is nowhere to found when the app opens , the subject in my search inquiry fromGoogldoesn't match , I don't know if it's a problem with the communication of the app or Google search, or both ?🤔 | What would we even do without Reddit?? | The app opens but doesn't even load any content. | Very interesting and informative 👍 | 💯🔥❤️it | App UX keeps getting worse and worse... | Love it, it's endless topics is just awesome!!!!! | Good less censored videos than most platformd | It's OK, I cannot copy text so I could do search or copy or translate... That's weird. | good have nice welcome Ho Gaya YouTube | It is cool connecting with Reddites with like interests. | Loving this app... | Has very good memes in r/memes | Wow | Love Reddit | Can't message till when why 😡 | 22 Mar 24 Update: Why does app now only load the top few comments and requires an extra tap to load more. We want less friction as users, not more. I like the community, but the app insists on sending me notifications for subs that I'm not a member of. I've tapped to mute those specifically. I joined sub and turned off notifications and left. Still they come. All notifications from the Reddit app remain blocked. | This app changed my life. | I wish Reddit the best. I think it is great. | Has begun to completely fail to open, spitting out ""let's try that again"" messages over and over | It's been am short amount of time that I have been using this app. So far I am enjoying it. Thank you. | Love it | since the latest update most of the time my feed is empty when I know things are being posted. this is infuriating as it always happens. | I b7eb this app mwa | Great unbiased information source | This app violates everyone's right of freedom of speech by censoring people with their beyond stupid Karma system. They should be sued | This app is great for readin' interestin' stories when ur bored at home and can help u figure out how to resolve things that have happened to u in ur gamin' experience | I just want to lower the score of this horrible app | Love to learn something new | In my Inbox, There are 3 notifications but I can't see them. I try to refresh but no change. Please fix this issue | I love all the chats and free Dice. I appreciate everyone ☺️ | When i try to sign up it say ""im sorry we couldnt authenticate you"" and it says this all the time with a new phone to | Plenty of opinions and information to pursue and peruse thru. Never a dull moment. | Easy to use, love it | You know how now when you're in a post and the original post is floating on top now? I want to turn that off. How do I turn that off? | Bad interface, stuff often just doesn't work or load correctly. Not only did they remove 3rd party apps, but they refused to actually make their own app competitive in any way. The app is slow and poorly made. Every update makes this app worse. | Reddit keeps asking me to rate the app. | Terrible app being run into the ground by corporate | I love it | Great app that's user friendly, which helps in exploring the vast content that's available. | Tanked all 3rd party apps, yet cant make a decent one of their own. Video player is a mess, custom feeds is a mess, hell even trying to click on a post is a mess half the time. Keep messing with UI instead of making a decent app. They sure make sure the ads are working though! | Support has zero reading comprehension and doesn't keep their word other than that great | Good | I've had Reddit downloaded for a really long time, but just this past year, I've started using it regularly. I found it a bit overwhelming at first, but now I'm pretty comfortable navigating around the app. One of the things I like the most is that there isn't much censorship on Reddit. We have so many sensitive people these days that you can't post anything.. without it being taken down or cxled by someone. So it's nice to have an app with little censorship 😉, hoping it stays this way 👍🏻!! | All my needs have been met. | My only complaint is that videos never load. (Edit) It's gotten better. | Lovely | Love reddit! | It's Reddit. Enough said. | Great app. No issues with crashing or bugs. I love that you can choose to be anonymous. I was confused at first about ""karma"", some groups deleted my posts and said I didn't have enough karma yet but after a search figured it out. | I think this is my favorite site now! | The app sucks in general. Worse, though, is that reddit screws withyour account and there's nothing you can do in the web browser to fix it. They literally disable functions. The words are there, and there's a button to press, but it doesn't do anything. Trash company, trash app 👎💩 edit: USING THE APP DOESN'T WORK EITHER. How can you be so consistently incompetent? | Love it. | Crashes every 5 seconds when scrolling. Don't even think about opening a text heavy post - it will freeze everything up and the entire app shuts down. These problems didn't used to happen 1 year ago. | Poor functionality | Crashes 80% of the times I try to use it | Since last update app keep getting stuck 😕 | This app has gotten buggy as hell. I'm starting to realize why people liked third party apps | Great place to find solution to quirky issues great community. | Reddit rabbit holes abound. I can go down the comments rabbit hole on Reddit faster than on other apps. Often hilarious, completely unrelated, and extremely helpful. | Lovely app could do the some improvement in its gpu layout. Edit : This app seems to have some weird bugs, for example app is showing me phantom chats on my chat that don't exist. Uninstall & reinstalling app doesn't fix the issue it keeps appearing regardless. Very annoying, because does not happen on my pc did happen till recently. Secondly the app keeps freezing results me having to restart it order for freezing to stop. This really annoying because actually like the app it was easy to use. | Can't even activate a new account | The recent update made many features worse and introduced new bugs. The app will randomly refresh, sending me back to the top of the post. Only one or two parent comments will load at a time. Images load much more slowly or not at all. | Really enjoy this app | I'm into chatting with pretty babes and there is plenty to talk to about life hobbies and habits, take my advice and have a go! | The Reddit mobile app is fine, it's buggy at times.

We&#39;ve updated our Android app with bug fixes and changes to improve your overall experience.","[""I hate that this is the only viable app for Reddit now. Videos either don't work, or multiple videos start playing at once, or a random video that's not even remotely close to the current content starts playing. Using the Android 'back' gesture for longer than a millisecond and the context menu pops up. Why?! Swiping to the next picture brings you to the 'Watch' page instead. You open the comment section and start minimizing threads? Guess what? They get expanded after 5 seconds again..."",""Reddit has changed the UI (AGAIN) and has made our memorized swipe gestures completely useless. It wasn't bad enough that they moved the context menus from the top to the bottom when looking at media, now no posts are separate when swiping in the expanded view - they're all just connected as if it was one large post. To top it off, now if the next 10 posts haven't pre-loaded if you've got a poor connection, you can't even open a context menu, you're just not allowed to. Now it's useless."",""Clicking the post used to make sense. Now you either open the picture in a separate window, with a \""go to thread\"" button that does not work, and swiping back to home doesn't work anymore. If you do succeed in seeing the text it opens with the ad right above the thread's top reply. Having to scroll up to see the content I wanted to see is annoying. I'm hoping this update is a fix to the problems that Reddit created for itself. This is getting absolutely ridiculous!"",""This \""gestures\"" update is awful. You're supposed to swipe up from the bottom to get to the comments on a post, but if you have gesture navigation on in Android, you swipe up from the bottom to go back. So in the same gesture, Reddit's moving to a new page, and Android's receiving a \""back\"" prompt, which undoes the action of opening the comments, which means if you open a picture in full screen you can't go back unless you tap it and tap the X, instead of using the device's universal \""back\"" action"",""The app bearly functions post will open on a delay clicking on a sub will just open an ad post, videos just won't load there's so much just wrong with this app I can't even list it all.

Предполагаю после всего надо еще ссылку на почте подтвердить....Я что какой то квест прохожу по проверке настойчивости при регистрации? | Still receiving post when I've already requested not to in the past. I don't appreciate being sent garbage when I've already asked to stop | Super! | Good quality and sizing. Fast delivery. | Wanted to buy something but the app is so slow I gave up | The downloading of the pages is much slower compared to the others thus surfing takes a lot of time. | Nice | App works very well - easy to search, choose, order and pay. I especially like the discounts with free postage that are exclusively for purchases via the app. Merci Bonprix ! | Easy to order, fast delivery, good quality | The app seems a little slow when kscrolling on the mobile. Other than that it's a great shop with quality clothing that is affordable and sizes are what they say they are with everything. Great experience for returns and customer service was friendly and helpful. Delivery indicated is also on time. Thank you BonPrix 😁 | Good prices for nice cloths | love the quality, prices and service! | bonprix hat alles fur alle, den bester online shopping kundenservice | It says on web that if I download the app I get 10%, I have spent 108euro and nothing :( | I am so happy about the app and also I really like shopping at Bonprix, they are very good. | Overall, I am a satisfied and happy customer. bonprix is my best online fashion shopping shop but recently I can't open anything anymore, it keeps saying something went wrong, and the suggestion for matching items is no longer available. Please fix it customer service because it's very annoying. Thanks | I use it regularly and but some lovely stuff! I do iti Italian as I live in Italy and am happy to say I am a very satisfied customer!! | Het doet wat ie moet doen | Achteraf betalen met ideal werkt niet. Heb op internet meerdere klachten gelezen, en Bonprix wenst er niks aan te doen. Waarom die dienst aanbieden als je niet zorgt dat het werkt? | Very comfortable for shipping 🙂 | super | Sehr Schön app | Not the language I understand why is it not in English so I uninstall it if only I can give 0 star why since the beginning of this year it went back to stranger language again it forstrating 🥵 | Nice fashion, crashin passion | Very laggy app. Every new page it prompts me to sign up to their newsletter. It logs me in but then I go to my account and it says there was an error logging in. Use your pc and webbrowser for a better experience. | Prima app, reageert wel wat langzaam. | badly performing, I'll go back to the mobile website | Good | I've just ended up buying the sane products again because it doesn't let you know you've purchased it before unless you check you bank .... now I have to try and send the sane items back .... and it doesn't tell you how unless I refuse the delivery ... it's rediculous | The app feels so sluggish, and scrolling through the products is such slow and annoying experience. Terrible. | Macht alles einfach mit dem App auf dem handy, muss nicht mehr bonprix googln | Ich mag diese App, weil sie sehr einfach zu bedienen ist | Wenn ich etwas in die Einkaufstasche packe verschwindet es nach einiger Zeit einfach. Die Artikel werden nirgendwo ""zwischengespeichert"". Da vergeht mir dann die Lust nochmal alles zu suchen. Ansonsten sehr gut aufgebaute App. | It's shame that this app it's only in German. | Jätte smidigt ♥️♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍 | Easy to make up the order, one star down due to no possibility to set own password or change it | Good app | Terrible slow app and makes it very hard to navigate when trying to buy products. I have stopped using it so many times just because it was so slow and keeps freezing! If you want to make money update your app!!! IN REPONSE TO YOUR REPLY- I've been using your app and website for years and it's always been slow not 'sometimes' but ALL THE TIME. Update your systems because it affects your sales as I know people who actually stopped using you all together because of your terrible slow app and website | Easy 👍 | Great | Top | Very good app | Very good 👍 | Fonctionne bien | Lovely clothes reasonable prices | Easy to use, convenient, visually bright | Quality and affordable | Super gute App! Ich bin suuper zufrieden!! | Molto m satisfatta Grazie bonprix | Ottima app, facile da usare, prodotti fantastici | Buona!! | Fint app och affären! | 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 | Wieso kann man payback nummer im app nicht eingeben??? | Wide selection, good rates and quick deliveries.. What' else🤗 | Sehr gut | Customer service totally absent, lying about transportation as well... Had to order 1 piece of cloth at a time which caused me to have to pay more in delivery fees... | Die App hängt total beim scrollen und auswählen der Stücke. So macht online Shopping keinen Spaß. | Very nice app to buy some quality good products | After updates, I get http bad request and unable to use the app anymore. Can you help?? | Ich finde die Bon Prix App sehr gut. Man super nach Produkten suchen und filtern. Die App ist übersichtlich und einfach zu bedienen. | Love this online store. Nice products. Lovely fashion especially considering that I'm not a fashion person. Would be great if the app allowed you to pay via ideal, it's been years since this function was no longer available in the Netherlands. The uitverkochte items shouldn't be advertised either or still be available to view. | very good app. good quality clothes (cotton) at a good price | It would be great if there was a option to change/choose the language while installing. Now everything is in German and I have no clue what I'm doing. | 😎 | Einfach zu nutzen | How can I change language to English and ship the order to Netherlands | Ok | Excellent! | Super App | Easy and fast | Super | Easy and economic. | Bra utvalg. Fort levering. | Easy to use Navigation responsive | Great. Een makkelijk app. Op verschillende manieren zoeken en filters te gebruiken. Ik gebruik het al lang en met veel plezier. | Good | Doesn't accept existing account. | Alles funktioniert einfach und einwandfrei. | Vero nice | Very nice app and also good quality | Ich bin zufrieden | Product ist immer super | Very fast and reliable 😃 | Ik kan me bank niet eens open krijgen met deze app dus moet ik inloggen in plaats me bank app te openen slecht bezig hoor | Sehr tolle Funktionen | Это самое убогое приложение для покупки товаров, которое я до сих пор видела. Каждый раз заново вводить данные карты? Вы издеваетесь? 2021 год на дворе. Кнопка Вернуться назад? Не слышали. Скорость работы как у дохлой лошади. Поставила две звезды потому что каталог работает. Ах да, ограничение на любимые товары 50 товаров, вы там вообще?.. но это не проблема приложения, это в целом проблема магазина. Вам серверов жалко, сохраненные товары хранить?! | I really love this store and app. Good functionality and great prices. | Billigt och smidigt bra qualitet! | Tolle App sehr praktisch | A very good 👍App | User friendly, quick, reliable. I'm very positive about this App. | Best online store | Start in German. I'm from Tussia. No way to change languages | Sehr Gut | Optimal | Very easy to use | Very good and fast | Sehr gut 👍 | Revised review: after several protest emails about being blocked from ordering 2 different sizes the customer service did assist me on an individual basis, which I appreciate. However they need to permanently change their policy in general, for all customers, all orders. Additionally the app itself is okay, but it is so irritating and unnecessary that the app requires password login constantly, even during use! If its idle for even 2 minutes, during shopping, it requires a new password login!!! | Very good | Duidelijk | Works fine. | sehr gut | Mooi en prijzen zeer redelijk | App ist super, einfach und leicht zu bedienen. | Very good sizes. Fast delivery and returns. Prices are a little too high and what I dislike the most is that when I get an email about free delivery my order has to be over €75 otherwise I have to pay the around €6 delivery, for someone that has and orders a lot from them should be able to have free delivery without any mindestbestellwert. Overall I buy things from here almost every second month. | Gut | easy and pleasant to use only minor complaint i have not found a quick way to get back to the main shop menu after putting an item in the basket. | I find the app easy to use and the products are comfortable. | The app is so simple to use. I like it 👌 👍 | Utrolig bra produkter. billig er det å forskjell til mange andre kles butikker. | Perfekt App | J aime bien l'app😊","{""1"":3880,""2"":665,""3"":6382,""4"":29479,""5"":217562}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","bonprix","9131093019835172916","android@bonprix.net","http://www.bonprix.de/service/kontakt/","bonprix Handelsgesellschaft mbH

Following days I got mails that my orders are delivered and I can retract them, but how? When I click on the ""track your orders"" , i am asked to download your application, but there is nothing about foreseen delivery dates. Would you please give me a feedback? Thanks, | Cool | Like it | 👍🏼 | Good | has some stuff on here that others don't even tho its all from china. prices are somewhat equal to aliexpress. wish. temu but temu has the lowest prices overall | They will breach privacy and share your data. They have no human support. A mere hours after I made order I started getting scam texts. | Cool | 💚 | Мне все нравится. Но только можете пожалуйста добавить чехлы для телефона Oscal C70. Спасибо 🙏💕! | So the app itself is AWESOME. But... Now there is a bug for me. Nothing shows up when clicking my orders,my cart etc. Please check it out. Overall 10/10. | excellent service | 💯 | Horrible customer service! And horrible program. I have been trying to cancel my delivery, and nobody is answering me either on the program or on email. What kind of online program doesn't have a cancellation button or a way for customers to contact the seller to cancel the order. | Good | Great website, great value for money, quality clothing | Rudely dismissive customer service, absurdly high prices along with ridiculous time frame for delivery. Don't waste your time and money. | I have had problems with codes but this is the first time I have used you if it all straight forward I will be back | jooooooom ! | terrible shipping. Ordered just a shirt in december and it said will arrive in january and im still waiting like 2 month. almost 3 | Good value for money. | Я дуже вибираю Япония Корея меі ближче, атож | 👍 | Everything ive bought has been cheaply made tat not worth the cost | 👍 | Very good allways deliver | it's all are very slow process, even showing in shipped condition but when I tried to track my order with given I'd its not at all...I paid 268$ for my order on 27 Jan 23..today I am sitting on 11 th Feb and no idea where is my order...I contacted c.care multiple times and got to know that they are looking but no resolution after 15+ days, am really very disappointed with service and response and now I am realizing that I think I lost my 268 dollars..edited my rate to 3. Wl make 5 once received. | The best app | It takes a month for the products to arrive but its worth it | Totally disappointed, was long time customer but recently incerun take orders used my money and after week's they cancelled order and asking again to buy the same product with higher prices, and while wanted help from joom, its horrible, but before their support was really wonderful. | Customer service is great.. I had a problem with a store Within 24hrs they refunded my money back.. | Very bad experience joom first my order accept after 6 days cancel and not refund me .I suggest don't use this app | The delivery is very Bad i didnt get any product that i order | Good | Good value for money but taking a very long time to arrive | good | I love Joom and I can't wait to buy things off here. | good quality and Good service | I love Joom been using it for years i have over 150 purchases but the thing thats bothering me is that on check out it says 143,15 BAM but they charge me 150,12 BAM which is not ok so basically the coupon i used was 'fake' | One star taken off for the following: Far from the greatest variety of products in all categories, a lot of just overbuying. Long delivery time, even with tracking. Delivery time can vary from the original. | I find everything | good | Wonderful App!! I'd love it if some packages didn't end up damaged, however. | Satisfide | The worst shopping app ever. You should not order anything from here if you don't want to wait at least 45 days (and still have not receive my order). The support team chat does absolutely nothing to help. They don't even know when will you gonna get what you paid for or the name of the delivery company of your parcel. The tracking code is not working either. If you can't sort out the delivery service, you better shut down this app. I would give this 0 star or even minus if there is an option. | I placed several orders and I still haven't received them...this program has no management...you can't even track your order problems...if you want to waste your money, definitely order products from this program. | I have used this App for years. Delivery times are better and products are from around the world. The variety of things and prices are great. I would highly recommend Joom. | Shipping takes way to long you never know if you will ever get your order from them | Very good | please give me my order on the time | congrats to the programmers | I don't know I never stay baying here | Really bad delivery service item due for Xmas its the end if Jan and still hasn't arrived no tracking available since the 15th of Dec and I need to wait untill the 22/02/24 to claim refund | Used to be amazing I have used for years however the last three orders have been terrible first one wasn't even what I ordered, second didn't arrive and the last one I ordered a pair of trainers, after 8 days still said assembling I contacted joom and they said not to worry it was probably just they hadn't updated. Scroll on and low and behold no trainers and the seller has cancelled the order ! I will receive money back they offered 10% off voucher, you get that daily anyways 🙄🙄 | pretty good | Good | I used to love buying stuff from here every week. Their prices in the last 2 to 3 years went up like 90%. I used to be able to get watches for like $2.50. Now there are $91 for the same watches. I thought OK they would be like 5 or $6. You know, prices increased but seriously. These are off brand junkie. Things that you know you get around Christmas time. They have the box sets that are like 10 bucks and stores. So I was getting a bargain, but this is ridiculous. This is a rip off whoever a chi | It's don't connect network.. | good | I will leave a review once I get the goods | poor app. takes time for your orders to arrive. poor quality products sold in this app. | I love Joom's gadgets & great prices. I find items on Joom I can get elsewhere. | I am still waiting for my orders and so unhapoy wjth your company as ive still not rwcieved them have been waiting for months now and very disapionted with joom i will no longer be buying from you | Too slow. Some of support consultants have an awful behavior. | Takes too long to be delivered | Good abb | Fast and accurate. | Disappointed | nice | Great service | Not bad value for what you get. | Good | More than 95% off products are just gone. Example, when I search for the word ""tactical"" I only get like 10 results compared to the 100s of 1000s of results I usually got. One day lots of products, next day almost everything gone. | Ordered a bunch of stuff which were meant to be delivered today but haven't received them yet. The app is now bugged and won't open even after deleting and reinstalling it. So I haven't had a good experience, but hey, it costs nothing for delivery and is cheaper as hell, so I can't expect much. Update: I received the items a few days late but did receive them. So I bumped up a star. | Good products and good delivery for Cyprus | Fantastic 👍🏾 | Great products @ Great Prices will deffo buying more products | Great service, and customer care, their service chat system is fantastic and they are quick with replying to help you. I had a broken controller and they where more than helpful | Happy | It is so good! 👍 | jggoh | They didnt refund my money,they dont update product location | I love shopping from Joom | interested 👍 | TOO PRICEY MOOObe time | Joom is a very good company. I have been shopping from joom long time and I am very happy | AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Sent me settee covers did not match the description or photos, all mismatched in size and branding, and they were incredibly negligent and cheeky throughout the returns process, demanding I take photos and videos of me handing them into a charity shop before giving me my refund. They even blocked communication at one point, resulting in my son having to download the app to reach them. I do have my money back now but they are incredibly rude, and a complete sham. | Excellent communication with customer service ..if any questions...reasonable delivery...had 2 orders up to now and I am pleased.. thank you ❣️ | Joom, Shopping like King 👑 I recommend It to the international consument | excellent | ჰბჰ | Great choice of products and so easy to order | good prices | always shop on joom...prices really good... | it's cool I liked, m | great value | Very very late delivery, to much waiting | like | good | i truly love this app | I noticed prices are more expensive and from my personal experience some sellers are scammers giving a false description of their items and when you complain with c/care they offer you some refund but keep these sellers on joom platform scamming other buyers and cheating other honest sellers | Its an amazing app i ordered a lot of stuff and they deliver faster than expected the prices are unimaginably cheap nike AF1 for 28€ thats a steal for sure. However almost everythibg is fake so keep that in mind. | Great prices and fast delivery. The best shopping app by far... | perfect | Good price and quick delivery | Į wanted to order some clothes my money gone but order dont go trough scammers :Dd | awesome app | It always does a good job with my purchase | Destul de util | very exclusive | this is a site where quality doesn't come with a big price tag | wicked little app good selection. | shop evrybadys home town come to shop hire is amazing thanks | avery good | Im still waiting for items i ordered in oct and nov 2023 ..it says my expiray date is expired.. | Don't use very often | Hi.i need blac hand beg.30 bax praiz | Ok | Still waiting for my order | nice | This is not good just wast ur money and time i have everything for this application thay making drama | no problem shopping with Joon and paying was easy just think it's a bit long for delivery | Poor delivery service and very disappointed. | probably would buy more if shipping was quicker | good | really nice products at at great price | I love this app, offers useful things for best proces and best quality possible, definitely 5 stars, keep up. | Always good value for money.Never a wrong item yet in 6 orders. Delivery free to your mailbox 30€ + Bit of a long wait but worth it. | Clothing displayed in ad does not appear after directed shopping click. | Very Happy | It's fantastic application | WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE, AND WILL BE HAPPY TO BUY FROM JOOM AGAIN ☆☆☆☆☆ | excellent 👍 | easy to shop for what you want without having to queue up at stores | Good | Why only credit? | This company was supposed to be rated with 0 stars. I want to return a product that's defective but they've asked countless times to send a video of the product and its operation which I did but they're still not satisfied with the videos that I've been sending them.

Further, there is no option to turn this off. This essentially ruins the usability of Zoom. Wanna add let someone into your room during a call? Good luck! Wanna adjust the volume? Oops, no screen to see anymore. It's maddening. And Zoom has known about this for at least 10 months. Horrible app. Use anything else if you have the choice."",""Horrible app! There's no way to put the meeting on \""speaker phone\"" so it only has the max volume of a phone call, meaning it's really hard to hear if it's not up to your ear. But that's weird because if you're holding your phone up to your ear, you're missing the video. I basically couldn't attend this webinar at all thanks to the zoom app, don't waste your time."",""Zoom never syncs with my device's audio settings, and has no audio settings of its own. Zoom can't be muted. Zoom destroys the audio quality of other apps most of the time. This isn't a hardware limitation when it works perfectly fine sometimes. Zoom randomly changes its own audio settings when starting up or playing sounds from other apps. Even when writing this review, my Zoom randomly shut off, and closed my meeting entirely."",""This review is more specific to Zoom Phone as a standalone phone. The line cuts audio out of the app is minimized, or you lock your phone. Inbound calls do not ring not matter how many settings, or ringtones I change. Often calls that I do manage to visually see come in, disconnect or time out while trying to answer. As phone line for a business, this is completely unusuable. I thought BlackBerry movius was bad, but this is tragic."",""UI/UX design is bad. It's my 3rd use and still can't figure out how to blur background while in a meeting and the guide I saw on google is not correct. Blur background should be the most important feature in your application and hsould have a quick access to it 2nd is bluetooth earbuds. It doesn't auto recognise the device, Mute, blur background feature should be present even during waiting time.""]",false,false,false,"us.zoom.videomeetings","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings&hl=en&gl=CZ"

I would also recommend improving the navigation icons and things and also make it easier to find community tabs on mobile. | My I'd hacked I try to recover no help, All my purchased games are gone | Won't let me log in even though I can log into steam on my computer no problem. Garbage app. | 6 stars | Nothing wrong with that, great | Used to work fine. After the recent update it doesn't open on Pixel 7 Pro It just crashes after 5 seconds before loading | Can there be less than an ignorant level of security between me and my games for NO reason?!?!?!? | Just no | Can't access steam guard with offline mode. Steam Guard window not processing in offline mode. It's just gray screen. | Broken. I used the deauthorize all devices and it broke the app to the point where the only thing that worked was uninstall and reinstall. | This sucks I've been trying to sign in for hours and follow all instructions but it keeps sending me backwards and by the time I finally goty account verified it would let me finish setting it up | Steam is a pedo orignaization. They support pedo values | Its crashing | good but would be better if you add the messaging system again | Unreliable app. Often times doesnt load or even open its own link to the app. Or, it just stays on loading screen. | Is this a joke? Already had my account hacked whilst steam guard was enanled, stuff bought and sold and couldn't get a refund, but now they remove the log out function on the mobile app. Steam security at its best. | After last update app crashes for no apparent reason. | Barelly working useless app. Cant comment or write post on community board and so. Totally abandonned by developer app - uses 3 years old chromium 85 browser which blocks logging to PayPal when trying to purchase anything (you can aswell easily lose your money due to it, as chromium 85 is most insecure, thus not used by any service provider for a long time, except Valve) ... In few words - pathetic incompetence and spitting in customers faces... | Worst new account sing up process... Not set new password very very poor setup sorry guise | Crashes constantly on startup | Just glad that it wants me to use two facotr authentication but it won't let me stay signed in on my phone to use the authenticator. Glad i get to deal with this bull cause I am stuck on your app in a position that it won't fix itself and all I can do is uninstall and reinstall and hope to god it works. Thanks for that | I love steam | Broken app. Trading buggy and not possible. Broken app. | Love the app it's awesome when Im at WORKIE | App wont open and keeps crashing | I purchased GTA 5 a week ago and I forgot my steam password since 7 hrs I'm trying to login even submitted everything and I got the same mail and number as well but still no response from them at all. | bro the steam app is useless it does not let me move my authenticator to other devices.When ever I try to move my authenticator to other device it says there was a problem signing in.Im tired of this even does not let me sign on my laptop says the same problem .And now I an still getting the same problem please fix this. | Won't even start | Imaging playing a game for five minutes, looking for a refund under steams policy, but after a week, still no refund | When I was doing login the password and email are wrong. Then I check they correct but it's show's wrong. I hate this app. See developer you had readed or hadn't. I'm warning you update this app | Waste of time. Prices so high. Poor user experience because everything requires paying. So many useless features. | Whenever I try to open the app and designing it doesn't let me sign | Keeps crashing | Ga bisa log in 🥲 | I don't have an account yet it wants me to sign in | Trash. This is pure garbage. It is clunky and when you text codes to log it the codes don't work. If I didn't have to use steam I wouldn't. | Normally works great. But with the new update can't open the app at all. Can't use the steam auth or anything | Impossible to pay using PayPal, the screen is in an infinite loop asking for PayPal username | IT KEEP CLOSING | Every time I check out to buy a discounted game, the app always rejects my payment method. | Keeps crashing | Can someone help me? I've already tried everything on repeat just to create an account but it kept on opening Chrome and asking to verify through my Gmail; done this over a dozen times. I just kept on receiving verification email (quoted emails after the very first ones, meaning it's the same sht over and over again). How will I ever create an account? Same shtty problem through my pc, captcha kept failing. It's excruciating. | Bro. Let me log in. Changed my password 4 times and keeps telling me incorrect password. | It won't let me sign in | Horrible never works properly. I can't even open it 99% of the time, and yes, I have a good phone s23 ultra, so I know it's not my phone. Also I could never get steam guard to work when I clicked it and it always made me re login to do anything and it would get stuck in loops doing so. | latest update made app crashes everytime i open it, W-T-F | I can't even access the steam guard code in offline so what's the point of using this feature. Especially my wifi is really slow and restarting my phone or clearing the cache doesn't fix the problem. | We need free gift codes !!! | It is a best app i seen ever | Fun m cool | Doesn't even open after the most recent update (2024-03-18) | Crashes every time I tried to open it. | Can't log into account on any device, tried making a new account and steam says account doesn't exist. | I want to give 0. I can't find way to get in game I buy or install. Even my cousin Lincon couldn't find way. | When i need to log in on pc it always need this app and its annoying because i dont use this at all and i unistall it, now i need to install this useless app just to log in on my pc | This company is a monopoly you can't buy your PC games really anywhere else but from here after you pay for them eventually steam will tell you you no longer have access or your license to your games and none of your library will open up or update there's really no fix and there's no way to get ahold of anybody that works for this company to try to fix it | ta walona aplikacja nie ma funkcji blika a na dodatek zabiera pieniądze | Buggy mess | At startup app shows steam logo then freezes and crash the app. App is just getting worse | Crashes too often | won't use my default browser, trys to use Samsung browser which I will not setup | TERIBLE app | Can't even login with a QR code. Please fix ASAP. | Nice app😃 | Not a huge fan of the update to be honest. I mostly used the app to chat with friends, and as an authenticator for my account. So it's kind of annoying that I need to have two apps for that now. The new app also doesn't seem to run the best on my phone. I don't really love the new layout either. I'm sure I'll get used to it, but I had no problems with the old layout. The app is still useful but just annoying that for my usages this update was almost entirely a downgrade. | Great, still need a little bit more improvement especially the cart ui. | Trash af | Good Very potty | This is the worst app ever IT HAVE PASSWORD TO UNLOCK I HAVE ACCOUNT ON IT WHY YOU ADDED PASSWORD BUT NOT IN SIG IN | How am I supposed to buy games if I can't see cart icon this app is full of bugs and glitches | Worse app in the world 🤬🤬 | Cant even make a account piece of garbage | App is crashing when try to use stem guard camera. | PayPal doesn't work | who's create those ugly ui 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 also the capta are so outdated and always not working | STEAM NEEDS TO FIX THIS LAGGY OR BUG BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE EVEN A ACCOUNT IN STEAM AND I TRIED TO CLICK THE ""don't have a steam account? "" IT WON'T WORK AND I TRIED THE USER AND PASS IT KEEP REPEATING IT SELF AND GO STRAIGHT IN SIGN IN!!! | Yasoooo | Trainz Simulator | random updates cause the app to cease to function. | Takes days to get support to do anything other then send pre written emails. Ok I have an issue that is not in any of the support. I can not get anyone to respond to my request for assistance. The solution I say again is not in FAQ, or any of your other documentation. I am done with steam. | Can't even open the app, it crashes. | It seems as if nothing works anymore. I spent some time trying to gain help with logging into my account in vain. I tried to find anything other than FAQ to help but the ""captcha"" doesn't work when trying to recover username/password. I'm just trying to play a game or two for God's sakes. Developers are the new money/blood suckers vs lawyers. Ridiculous | It's like Real player from the 90s. Trash trash trash | Too many bugs | Thanks for locking me out of my account | Can't complete purchases | Steam will delete your purchases and then say they cannot restore them. | Horrible app. Even can't create an account! Sucks | Stupid app can't even type in verification code | The application is very nice and informative. The application is very fast working in the phone. I have used the application. It's giving survics nicely. The application is progressing day by day | Very Nice Apps😊 | You never get the game that you searched for, truly disappointing. | I got my account has been, won't be work, can't login, star 1 now you can star down My waste of time, im studying for day per | useless app...entering username and password is no problem, but entering the guard code is impossible...charcaters change location when entering them. | steam good good8 | It would be good if we can see and adjust categories in the game library. | Steam guard won't let me type in the code sent to my email | Is the login to its own authentication for login. Fails login with no specific error then says too many attempts as if I did something wrong. | Capthcha doesn't work and account recovery is near impossible. | It's pretty much only good for looking at games, and even then, it seems to have issues loading pages. Furthermore, navigation is quite confusing. | Many games to choose from | I try to log in and entering the guard code is BEYOND BUGGY! It jumbles everything i type in and the ability to backspace does not exist here. | it would not allow me to create an account due to the ""im not a robot quiz"" | Buggy, couldn't even make it past the login code verification screen | can't believe this is an App of a gaming platform. so terrible | It's hard to log back in to my account and it's also hard to make a steam account | 100 notifications an hour about nothing the app. | I can't buy any game there is no option for Google pay 😭 | Has anyone from stream tried to put a verification code in as it just don't work. | Terrible. I download this and open it, i dont have a steam account so i made me create on on my browser. i did it and went to a free game and it asks if i have steam installed but on computer browser. i pressed yes and the screen didnt do anything. so i then pressed no bcause i dont have the browser one on my chromebook. it sent me to download it and said it wasnt compatible with chrome. Face it, ask ur parents to get u a moniter/computer/pc. because chromes are wack when it comes to gaming. bye | The Steam app is essentially all of the social features of the desktop client, without the ability to play the games. It also is a must have for security as it allows you to enable 2FA to keep your game library safe, and it actually makes logging into your account easier in the process. This app is a must have for any Steam user due to Steam Guard but if you're a big fan of Steam like I am, grabbing all three of the apps helps to further enhance what is already an amazing experience. | Payment fails most of the time and whenever it succeeds it says error then they send me the game after few hours. Frustrating | Besttttt | Should probably introduce a feature to be able to download soundtrack and other media directly to mobile for ease of use | I like 👍 | It's great | I don't under stand this app my email is real buts it's say my account is incorrect | Never got it to work. | I don't understand what other people is talking about, it's not confusing at all if you actually try to understand how it works. It's easy to understand,navigate and great for finding games while you're not at your computer/laptop. Please ignore the other people's stupidity and ignorance. I can pay,add to cart,add money to steam wallet and buy dlc just fine. It also doesn't have network issues. | Steam Mobile app works like a charm... Steam Guard is an added advantage. | Steam should filter game reviews or simply remove ones that are in no way related to the game, so tired of looking for real reviews to only to be met with unfunny idiots making nothing reviews because they have no life. Worst part is those nothing reviews are often highly rated and awarded, never knew the PC community was filled with such sad, boring losers. | Good | Body shamers 😂 They keep on removing and banning games that has asian body types, which is really offensive for us Asians | Put my user name and password in and it keeps saying thats not correct. But its correct on pc when i put it in. Change the password and still doesn't work. | Cannot put code from email to verify. It just doesn't work. So it's useless... | Pretty nice app. Could use some minor improvements. And it should be easier to chat with friends, Steam chat app should be built in. Steam is the best game launcher for PC imo. | I tried to get signed up and I could not read it at all. Not useable do not download if you have a low resolution type of phone. DISAPOINTMEN! | It's poor I signed up my account because I don't have a account yet, It keeps saying it's verified. | Terrible UI. Can not enter more than 1 number in guard code field while the code requires 2 numbers to be entered. | Went to remove authenticator. Instructions said through the app. Gives me outdated screenshots. Basically impossible to remove via the app. | i love u steam | Why is it so hard to sign back in | My account got hacked while being away from my desktop, i immediately got an email that my password and email (russian federation) got changed. I contacted support and rushed home, when i opened my email i got a message from support that my account has been saved. All that within 15 minutes! W steam 😁 | Used to work, now I can't even sign in without issues. Anytime it sends me a code, I cannot type in any numbers, or backspace, or even paste what I want to input. I have had to close the app twice already and I still cannot sign in the normal method. | Good app thankyou stram community | Очень полезное приложение. Когда уехал в другой город и ты далеко от компа то все равно можешь покупать игры и следить за скидками. Но порой лагучее | I cant log in due to the verification code input it keeps over typing in the wrong blank | Plz add Google account system to log in | Steam is king. I have all my games and friends in one place. Also I love the steam guard feature. And just do away with my passwords. Thanks Valve. | My experience so far has been ok after using the app very lightly over the last few months. Only 3 stars. You'd think that a company like valve would have a killer app that is highly rated and works for everyone but apparently not. | do not force links to open in Chrome. let them open in the default browser. stop autoplaying videos. | Brown and love Jesus | Usually I have a fine experience with Steam, however i have encountered an issue where the page where you are meant to be able to reschedule your gift is unexpectedly blank, preventing a reschedule. Additionally, it is incredibly hard to find a way to report this issue or ask for help. I've tried to send an email but I have been left with no response. | Months ago I lost access to my account, every time I reset my password the message ""check your password and name"" shows. When I try to get help with my account, I am required to access the account first (wich is the problem). No email to reach a real person at all. At the end of the day, I paid for some software I am not allowed to access, and no way to get some help. I have tried all the options on the support page, but nothing works, just wasted my money. Never again Steam for me or my kids. | Whenever I'm entering my steam guard code it just scrambles what I'm typing and I can't even change it because my keyboard doesn't backspace it so I can't even log in. | App is okay and great for quick purchases. Not much use passed that. I would love for Steam to expand it's app and add a soundtrack player to the app. This way while your at work you can listen to the soundtracks you purchased. | i want to make an account cuz i dont have one. then i need to log in in an account to make one but i dont have one!? so how tf are you supposed to log in? (edit) i found out u could only make an account with an pc. so why does is say you can make an account and not just say that it only works on pc? | Good | Dojodp😇 | worst signup process, mf invalid captch to create mf account 🤬, which mf robot will be signup your freaking website or app, play store please remove this application 🤬 | What does Valve even do except sit on their platform and ambiently make money from other people's transactions? Because they sure as hell don't reinvest it into their apps, which are buggy, barely updated messes. | Can't even type in the stream log in vertification code. I try to type it in but it keeps skipping the letters, must be a glitch. | When I make a account it doesn't work | ไวทุกอย่างยกเว้นเรื่องคืนเงินช้าโคตร | App sucks can't even log in they send a code to use but App won't let you type in correct so App is useless | The steam app still has many bugs that has never being fixed. | Can't even use the app because I can't get pass the steam guard. Recently got a new phone Galaxy S24 and am trying to log into my account. Once I get to the steam guard page it emails the code to me then when I try to type it in it mixes the letters and numbers and doesn't allow me to fix it. Can't even delete what I typed. Physically unable to use the app because of this. | Geometry dash | Unresponsive | How is this app so bad? Literally the only thing I use it for is to check to see if my friends are online, because this app is just really awful at doing the things it's built to do. It's truly strange. | Unable to log onto account. Steam guard code gets emailed however the app won't allow me to enter the code. Keyboard does not open up and allow you to type. It's useless at this point in time. Also, every time I request a code, the code sent to my email is always the same. Not sure if that's intended or not. | I never liked steam sure I accidentally keep messing up my own making account but I can't do it again it won't let me!!!! | App suddenly stopped loading my library. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling and logging in and out, but nothing worked. It was working just fine earlier.. | Can't make an account because I'm not a robot is broken Please Fix | It won't let me create an account, if i verify my email it brings me back to sign in page | five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Can't get passed the security code part because none of the letter/number inputs work at all. | trash, glitchy and so buggy. cant even perform simple tasks like adding steam guard, etc etc. steam app used to be so good back in the days, dont care about your update UI/UX , we need smooth and bug/glitch free experience. | A bug prevents paying via PayPal. It's been there for a long time. It must be the third bug or something because valve can't count above two. | Can't pass the steam guard as it won't let me enter the code in the proper order. Can't wait to see all the bugs pass the login... | This is a junk app and trash system | Worst app i can't even create an account.I tried to many times. | Decent app, haven't seen much bugs though like the other top reviews say. Overall, the Steam Mobile app os really only reliable for trading. | Genuinely cannot log in, the Activation (Steam Guard) Code refuses to type in correctly, completely bugged. | Please fix the bug with trading | When i try to enter the verification code it just misses up the code input order. | Older app was much nicer and worked better, sad its gone for the new one to take its place paypal integration appears broke, just loops on input email | this app is so trash | Your Servers are worst than 3rd class!! I think the Developers are just doing timepass!! What is the use of this app if we arent able to make a purchase? Everytime it gives me error whenever I try to make a payment!! Just worst..... Only deserves 1 stars!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 | When I try to login I can't enter steam guard code properly | I can't sign in | The PayPal payment option doesn't work anymore, during one of the biggest sales of the year. | The im a robot keeps saying I'm not a person but I click on all the right stuff it's just rigged and stupid | Did not let me make account saying ""Captcha invalid"" | This app is useless if using the browser site is better because when I try to by something through the app with PayPal I enter my email or number it just loops back to entering my information and doesn't work go through ever. I never have this problem using the browser to buy anything. This app is terrible with zero updates to fix this issue. | i hate it because it makes infinity steam comfirm emails | Just buy games directly from the publisher. Avoid Steam. | The support team is terrible and even given days they just don't respond | Buggy mess, just horrendous. | Its so slow and now I cant load my inventory | This is the worst app.It doesn't matter any account and can't be signed in .Developer should remove this system | It won't let me sign in","{""1"":398735,""2"":89939,""3"":58113,""4"":79666,""5"":374865}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Valve Corporation","Valve+Corporation","steamandroidapp@valvesoftware.com","http://store.steampowered.com/about/mobile","Valve Corporation

Bohužel chybí Monet (MaterialYou) design ikony. | Sometimes broken night mode, and app discontinues when you dont use Google Services, and yet you are able to use the web app. | Aktualizace horší než verze předtím! | Damn, ten novej UI update je very good. Navíc se vidím že ten Widget budu používat docela dost. Dobrá práce | Poslední update aplikace přinesl nový widget na plochu, který nahrazuje ten starý. Jelikož jsem designer webových stránek, musím přiznat, že je designově docela pěkný. ALE - je naprosto nepraktický! Chybí u hodin číslo učebny a to je přece to hlavní co potřebuju vidět mezi hodinami když jdu na další předmět! Dále bych implementoval změnu dolního řádku. Nyní je to v pořadí následovně - třída | skupina | vyučující. V mém případě se třída i skupina někdy shodují, tím pádem není potřeba zobraz. oba. | massive improvement in loading times and nice widget | Nová aktualizace změnila widget na rozvrh tak, že teď není vidět v jaké učebně je jaká hodina, což byl jediný důvod, proč ten widget vlastně používat. Edit: dík Kubo | Přidaný rozvrh a celkové zrychlení aplikace je super, ale nejdůležitější informace na widgetu rozvrhu chybí a to číslo učebny. | Po novém updatu jsou widgety naprosto nepoužitelné, jelikož už neukazují, v které učebně se hodina odehrává. Jinak aplikace funguje dostatečně dobře. | imagine chodit do školy v roce 2024 lame ahh bozos (měli by přidat fortnite ishowspeed kai cenat royale) celkem docela middyball kde je seckgs??? | Nový widget je PŘÍŠERNÝ, vůbec se v tom nejde vyznat, lepší to bylo když to bylo v tabulce. Fakt hrůza, opravujete něco co úplně v pohodě fungovalo. 🙄 | Nový widget je oproti tomu, který jsem mohla mít předtím, pěkně nanic... Zabere moc místa a neukazuje učebnu, což je jeden z hlavních důvodů, proč člověk do bakalářů ve škole kouká. A třeba celé jmeno vyučujícího by tam vůbec nemuselo být. | After new widget update for the app, the widget just doesn't work, after logging in trought the app and the widget itself it says no data to display. So now I just lost my timetable widget and need to open the app everytime which is annoying in many ways | Wildly used application in czech education system, that is neither good nor bad. There are some stuff that are annoying but nothing extensive, an example I would give is Bakalari randomly logging you off when opened, you either need to login again or reopen app. The app now started showing ads when opened, my rating will stay on 1 star till you add option to turn them off. | Extreme nestabilní a často nefunkční aplikace. Nechápu jak na ni může záviset celý náš školský systém. Neintuitivní UI a hrozný výkon. 0/10 | my grades are bad | Aplikace není moc dobrá, ale to by si člověk zvykl. Ale co pár dní mě odhlašuje, takže na to není vůbec spolehnutí. Možná děti nemají úkol - nebo mě to možná jen odhlásilo. Naprt. | It's good app, sometimes is here problems, but still good to give 5 * | Giving one star more for the dark theme, but I absolutely hate the wholly unjustified useless ads. Why are there ads? Are you that much greedy for money? | čím dál horší. nyní si vůbec nepamatuje hesla k účtům. stále chybí funkce, které jsou ve webové verzi. | Dobry, ale chce to dalsi UX vylepsovani.. napr. moznost kopirovat text ze zprav v Komensu, nastaveni notifikaci - treba vypnout notifikace u znamek, ale nechat u zprav, atd. Edit: dekuju developerum za odpoved, ale nejak nechapu jestli to planuji nejak resit.. | Aplikace se neustále odhlašuje. Také by bylo dobré, aby se notifikace daly zapnout např. jen na známky. Mám více dětí a aplikace mě neustále bombarduje jejich úkoly. | Proč akce zpět nepřejde v aplikaci zpět, přestože je v okně funkční tlačítko šipky? Pořád mačkám android tlačítko zpět a nic se neděje. Běžně aplikace přijdou zpět a na úvodní obrazovce aplikace nakonec zavřou okno. | Vždy to padá | Aplikace nezasila notifikace na zmravy v komensu na nastence. Edit: napsal jsem e-mail, nikdo nereagoval. Zobrazuje reklamu. Bez souhlasu uzivatele. | No good | Mám ve škole dítě A a dítě B, propojené účty. Škola nemá povolené oprávnění ke zobrazení známek pro dítě A, to si ale vyřeším se školou. Od aplikace přijde notifikace o nové známce, kliknu na ni, otevře se aplikace a hlásí, že škola nedala oprávnění pro zobrazení známek pro žáka A. Odkliknu hlášku, ale aplikace mi zůstane ve stavu s točícím se kolečkem na prázdném pozadí. Aplikaci vypnu a otevřu znovu, jdu na žáka B a hle: má novou známku, přesně tu z notifikace. Proč notifikace vede na žáka A? | Ads? Are they serious? | Lidi tohle je prostě úděsný, nevím jestli to je vaší aplikací nebo tím, jak ji moje škola implementovala ale user experience za 4. Aplikace se načítá dlouho, webová stránka ani není schopná vyhodit timeout, takže není poznat, zda je dole server nebo ne, aplikace nedokáže zpracovat půlbody do známek, náhodně odhlašuje, pravidelné výpadky o víkendu trvající kolikrát až do středy a další... V případě že je chyba na strašně školy, hodnocení a znění recenze úměrně tomu upravím. | Sussy baka | You can't even zoom out on schledule | Přišel sem dom najednou mama doom slayer a že ,,co ten petkos"" nestihnul sem odpovědět a dostal sem high kick a vyletěl sem až k sousedovi NESTAHOVAT | Dostala jsem pětku z přírodopisu a máma mi otřískla hlavu o stěnu NESTAHOVAT | Chtělo by to update, čísla 1,2,3,4,5 už mě nebaví. Také mým rodičům vadí když dostanu číslo 5. Nedoporučuji | Dostal jsem 5 z biologie a matka mi otřískala hlavu o stěnu | School ew | Aplikace dobrá, spolehlivá, ale oproti starší verzi mi zde hodně chybí předvídač i pro předměty, které jsou hodnoceny v procentech... | Naprosto zbytečná změna aplikace tato se více seká a jde pomaleji, s tou minulou jsem tyhle problémy neměl 😡 Edit: No tentokrát jste se fajt překonali, už se ani nemůžu přihlásit, proboha vy fakt nedokážate tu aplikaci projednou zlepšit? | thanks, I hate it | In english language mutation the app sends notification about homework with a grammar mistake. It says homeworks, however the word homework in english has no plural form. | Nightmare... | Tohle byl hitleruv plan v roce 1939 | Reklamy fuj tajxl, hjudž L | Achjo furt samý špatný známky kurva už | Pokulhává to, pokulhává... Evidentně málo peněz, zmatek v požadavcích, zmatek v realizaci a provoze... Teoreticky dobrý nápad, prakticky... Viz komentáře tady :-( TIP: na novém Androidu přestaly chodit notifikace! Řešením bylo smazat data aplikace (nastavení/aplikace/Bakaláři, úložiště, smazat cache, smazat data - obojí!). Bohužel je pak nutné zase všechno nastavit. Notifikace chodí, stejně blbě jako dříve, ale chodí :-o | Notification of a new mark should include the name of the account/child so that you do not need to open the app. | Načítá se strašně dlouho, pěkně nanic. A každá známka mi přijde tak 38 krát. | V aplikaci nejsou žádná data. Kde udělali vývojáři chybu? | Not functional | - Authorization of profile expired all the time - Some messages are not visible in detail (I can only see the beginning in the list) | nejdou mi otevrit komens | At random time it simply stop logging with the account. Workaround is to delete and create login again which is annoying (however since yesterday even this doesn't help to login). Inside app is fine and serve the purpose. | Whoever made this, I hope you fall of a swing snap ur neck and never recover 🫶. btw if crashes A LOT | school | Katastrofální aplikace. Tvůrci by se měli zamyslet nad svými životy | Awful UI, awful UX, awful altogether. | Prestaly fungovat notifikace. Zvlaste z komens. Loni bez problemu. Letosni skolni rok nic. Jak to muzu spravit prosim? | Notifications stop coming after some time of usage. After (pupil) relogin it starts to work but again for some time only. | Školy potom co pouzijou nejhorší, nejrozbitejsi aplikaci na celým internetu jako žákovskou | Na pc to pokaždé vypadne. | For me the app works almost perfectly, but when there are two timetables each for week (ex. week 1 5 lessons a day, week 2 6 lessons a day), there will be never shown the shorter one. I always see only one of this two options, even if I check another week. Thus works in web version, but not in the app. | Although it is pretty easy to use its loading time is so long I could finish most of my tasks... Plus most of the time it doesn't even work saying it can't connect to the school server or other things... | It work well .. just there could be more functionality | Doesnt work | V jednom kuse nefunguje, prostě tvrdí, že server neodpovídá. Přes web prohlížeč to přitom jde | Jak zkopírovat text ze zprávy od učitele ve vaší mobilní aplikaci?!  Na mobilním telefonu Android ani ve webovém prohlížeči Chrome nelze zkopírovat text ze zprávy.   Váš systém je hnusná práce vašich programátorů a prostě řezání rozpočtu. | School kekw | Ukazuje špatně známky + chybí ukrajinština | Čas od času náhodně odhlašuje a pak i po zadání přesných přihlašovacích údajů se nelze přihlásit zpět. Tzv se nemůžu vůbec přihlásit jen kvůli nějaké nadbytečné funkci která pak někde zapříčiní nějaký glitch | Black screen when I click on a lesson in the timetable | Vše je ok, až na rozvrh hodin. Kdykoliv kdy kliknu na nějaký předmět v kartě rozvrh hodin, celá obrazovka zčerná a nic se neděje. | Když kliknu na odpadlou hodinu tak se mi ukáže pouze černá obrazovka, nejsem jediná. | Nefunguje to zmrdi | Looks awful, always online, also doesn't even launch on Android 12 (Pixel 6 Pro). | Everything worked just fine untill I switched to android 12, then the app stopped working in the way that it won't even launch and immediately crashes. I wrote on support but no answer whatsoever. And I know that I'm not the only one having this issue. | Kdy opravíte crashování aplikace na Google Pixel 6? | Oh it's bad and keeps not logging me in or being slow but instant crashes all the time? God damn can't even open the app | I don't know but last time I opened my app it just disconnected me and I can't even join my account | Bonzující aplikace | Aplikace crashne při zapnutí na pixel 6 | mrdka | Nejde ani zapnout | porad pada | Po aktualizaci telefonu (Vivo Y33s) se aplikace nedá spustit. | completely stopped working. tried redownloading it about 4 times and still the same problem. when i try to open the app it shuts down | Mrdka nejde zapnout | Ads! | Píčovina | Dostal sem pětku. | Lots of small issues that show this is not a completed application, although in wide use. Web and android apps display different sets of data (i.e. missing class activity), changing font size is just increasing white space in app, notifications are not showing child name (it works well only if you have one child) and not linking to exact event, etc. The second star is given because it has dark mode. | Na android 12 nelze vůbec spustit. Po vteřině aplikace hned spadne. | It crashes on my phone I got android 12 | Not working on Android 12 | No dark mode | Nefunguje, po spuštění okamžitě spadne. Android 12. | Doesn't work on Android 12 | I can't log in even when i ask my teacher for new log in it's still telling me Wrong password and then i can't see my grades | V aktualni verzi nejde vubec spustit, pixel6, android12. Kliknu aplikace se na 1-2s otevre a zavre se. Vidim tam jen nějaká tlacitka ""import data from previous version"" a ""skip"" Smazat data ani uninstall nepomahaji | Last time it works just ugly. Quite often it cannot load information for a long time or authenticate, then returns error. Other parents experience the same problem too. | App crashing right after start on Android 12, Pixel 6 | Reloading..... Reloading.... Reloading.... | App won't me to login now and on pc works fine and don't ignore our comments because users of this app are mainly teenagers and kids .. I'm almost 18 | Přihlašovací čas tak zdlouhavý, že si stihnu požádat o půjčku a splatit ji. | Bro ur servers slow.

Sem tam nějaký ty chyby při logu atd.. ale furt lepší než by to dělala Babishova vláda XD | Špatný | Even a student can make better app shame on you | I can't log in and i really need it for shool so i can't see what principal saying new or because covid | Aplikace poslední dobou nefunguje přesně, když jí člověk nejvíce potřebuje. | Keeps crashing right after launch on Google Pixel 6 | App not starting on Android 12 | Tato aplikace nemá možnost zapnutí se, děkuji. | Pro každé přihlášení musím znovu zadávat heslo. Aplikace si neumí heslo zapamatovat. | Aplikace má nyní funkční přihlašování. Ale upozornění na každou novou známku chodí XXkrát za sebou. To opravíte jednu věc a hned má aplikace další fatální chyby? Po dlouhé době fungování aplikace? | Not good | Randomly logged me out, forgotten password button in app leads to an infinite loading page, website says that email is incorrect even when I entered the correct one | Vidím, že hodně lidem přestalo fungovat přihlášení. Mně pomohlo smazat všechna data té aplikace a přihlásit se znovu. Uvidíme, jak dlouho to vydrží. | Ty známky mi vždy zkazí den a kdyby to aspoň fungovalo jak má. | Traumatic | Po dnešní aktualizaci opět funkční na Anroid 7.Díky | Nechodi oznameni | S každou aktualizací je vše horší a horší - problémy s přihlášením, upozornění přijde jednou za měsíc apod. Aplikace je pro mě většinou prostě nepoužitelná, zároveň ji vážně potřebuji. | Nefunguje mrdka | how do i put zero star? | I really like it, smooth and easy to use! | Gud vetr | Idk zatím mi to funguje, takže asi good | Na nic L aplikace | Every update it's getting worse... Now i can't even log in | I dont find this app as suatable for Czech schools yet. Ratings of the grades and the average are not the same as the semester end grades. It makes missmatch with the children and parent expectations and teacher assessment at the end. | Fixněte už ty web sockety. Aplikaci musím vždy spouštět dvakrát, aby se načetl obsah. | Disgusting app | Bylo by vhodné namísto info ""Máte novou známku"" napsat ""Nová známka - Petr"" Nikdy z těch notifikací nevím kdo tu známku dostal a musím otevírat celou aplikaci, což zdržuje. | Bylo by dobré, kdyby zase bylo možné v předvídači zadat bodové hodnocení. | Lepší než žakovská | Občasné problémy zde jsou | k hovnu jednoduse | Jaký orangutan tohle vymyslel? Aplikace absolutně nefunguje, nemůžu se ani přihlásit protože to hlásí nějaký errory. Když se konečně přihlásím, je mi z toho zle. Když si tam dám dva účty, nemůžu si nastavit aby mi chodila oznámení jen z jednoho účtu. Nemůžu si jeden nastavit jako výchozí, aby mě to automaticky přihlásilo do něj. Používal bych verzi na počítač, ale tam zas nějaký primitivní primát vymyslel, že ""z bezpečnostních důvodů"" mě to každou minutu odhlásí. | Užitečné. Jen by se hodilo doplnit do notifikací z jakého účtu žáka pochází | I hate school | continuously logs me out of my profile | Hruza | Nefungují notifikace. | Good for helping with school. | Neukazuje průměr","{""1"":4774,""2"":885,""3"":855,""4"":702,""5"":1516}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","BAKALÁŘI software s.r.o.","6863759755042720851","aplikace@bakalari.cz","https://bakalari.cz","Čs. armády 2

However, the app sucks. It takes forever to load and it lags. On top of that, when I zoom in, it glitches andn would zoom back out. It doesn't perform as well as the website. It's lowkey useless.

But it's really buggy at times on every platform (android, apple, website on PC), which gets really frustrating. Especially when it's a paid service.

But I don't know much about this app I've only been on it for about a month and a half. | When it works it's ok. But it doesn't always work. Too many times it won't deliver messages for long periods of time. | Awesome | Wow | This app is awesome | 😊👍👍👍 | Love ya all | I contacted customer service about an issue and they still have not replied back. March 23, 2024: I just got a new laptop and downloaded Signal. unlike before, it's not showing ky chat history. I NEED to see my chat history otherwise this app is useless and will switch to WhatsApp. | Good | That's good | Great app! | Good so far | Love this app! | Great! | I love it anyway although I am not an everyday user... | I like the idea that I can text my buddy in Germany. | Couldn't answer | Very nice | It's a messaging app | Network clear | So far with the app I like the features . Hoping to get more customisation with the hidden app | Able to speak with everyone clear no interruptions no negative feedbacks | [feature request] Add timezone to the delay send function. This would be very beneficial to travelers. A lot of times when I'm delaying a message, it's because I don't want to wake someone up. | Nice app for meeting with others | Nice | great | Good real good | Just works really well | Nice app | Very good and fast | Best Chat App for privacy and Android to iPhone communication. I use video calls often with no issues. | It doesn't want me to login | Calls no longer go through...  You only get missed call notifications now.   Tried on both Android and iOS with same result. | Excellent service | Good | just got it give me a week | I love this app | No comment comment | User friendly | Good | It is very useful | Terrible!!!!! Keeps on hanging every now and then. Just editing my review to say the same thing again | A gold standard for private communication. Just a catch, it doesn't have screen sharing feature like the PC version. | Phone connection is very poor. Always networking failures or reconnecting. Texting is very slow. Not to crazy about this app. Better quality out there. | Great easy to use | Excellent app | My messages is not going and it says I should verify , after I verify and it keep saying fail .I have it | Calls do not ring or vibrate anymore. | I like this app | Calls take to long to come through and keep dropping | Never makes me disappointed | Good | I like | Very good 👍 | A lesser interface with less options than telegram | Best app ever | Excellent | Before it was good , but for the new version , it can just send the text message and voice message, doesn't ringing , when you want to call for anyone just it calling not ringing , it seems it became limits for messaging not for calling . | Very good and amazing | Sometimes really massive battery usage. Also, it's way to cumbersome to set a silent notification tone for certain chats. | So good | Like this AFP but i'm NOT crazy ABOUT IT | Got invited by a friend...but its like sms to me so useless. | Very bad,I really hate the fact I can't login to my account keeps showing me to verify that am human which I did but still popping out to verify again and again | Very good | almost good very happy that app using | I am friendly on here | It's a cool app but i can't message number and i message all number that are on signal on my phone the message not delivered 😠 | Its fun to use | The name is true. It's called Signal, it's a messenger and it's very private. What's not to love? | Nice app | So far so good | It's a good amp to have to | Positive and has excellent privacy, more so than Facebook/Messenger etc. | Excellent! | Good | I like this app. Don't have any problems with it. | This app is big on privacy, and sticks to it, unlike Messenger, or other services that claim to erase your messages. At least I hope it to be a true fact... ... ................ ........,.... ......... ........ | Its very nice and good to use, every feature of it is working perfectly 💯 but I don't know why message stop delivering all of a sudden, just saying I should verify, and I did that many time but the problem is not yet solved | Good | Great app easy to use and I'd recommend it for anyone | It is a good app to have on here | Its very good app | I don't understand the app anymore, I can't call someone now because he is short one good, please fix it | Really good 👍 | It's areal unproblematic and useful information and I like it | very good app makes my day | I find this app to be very fast on delivering messages. It will be helpfull if there is word correct included to help with the spelling. I am injoying this app.☺ | Cool | Cool app, first time using it, and already enjoying it. | To many women after game cards | Good | Hard to use | Well the app is pretty much the same as any other text app but what a ride ive been on on it lpl | Very good this app is nice and I have fun being on it | So far I have had no problem with this app | Excellent messaging service, secure and easy to use. | Absolutely 💯 Amazing !!!!!! | Excellent..no fake scams..right on!!! | This app always performs well I've had no problems with it corresponding or sending pictures. It is my favorite out of all telegram WhatsApp Messenger Google chat. I've tried them all I like signal | It's keeping me connected with a loved one who is overseas. God bless whoever invented it! | ""I said... NICE ONE BROTHER"" | this app tried to backdoor my phone without my permission😑💯 | Good app. But not super than Telegram,whatsapp etc.I can't see my favorite contact's last seen | I like most of the features, sharing pictures is a little different other than that, I like the privacy and verification | The only trustworthy messaging app! | Dopest. | It's good and private | This app allows our family to stay in touch across the world! Calls are clear every time! | okay | Good app | It has been great | Fantastic | My signal app does not have two factor verification why? check this as soon as possible | Very good and useful. | How can a messenger be private and secure if you need a mobile number for registration? 2 stars for outright lies during positioning | Would give a 5 but the gifs wants to be updated | Thumbs up. | The most safe and secured way of chatting. I've loved and been with Signal Private Messenger since 2019, I've encountered zero issues from day one and their updates even makes the system very strong. | Awesome | Great way to communicate with people in your life. | Great app to use. Never any issues with it. | Great app | I love this app because I can text call on it | it's ok thank you | Great app | The best IM there is! | Works well .... just hope it is as safe as described. | Tge App is definitely good, the only thing i do not like is that i had an issue during a System Update and had to Reset the Phone... There is no way to retreive your previous Chats nor Contacts, and that seems a bit of missed important function | Great reception. Great service. | Works well, no complaints. | I love keeping in touch with people I know | Ok 🙂👍💯 | Stunning. | I have heard so many wonderful things about Signa1 iwanted to use it thanks. | Has been taking 12 hrs or so to send receive messages. I got 3 messages today from 3 days ago. | It's has been the best chatting platform so far..... And it's very useful | very good | Hopeless. Can't connect to wife or vice versa | Still navigate the app but enjoying the face time and all the features in the app | Was greatly secure but now has allowed an open backdoor to gov.... plural.... so it's like same if you have it same if you don't | Marvelous app. Never hangs, notifications work perfectly. Voice calll and video call experience can be improved but won't complain; it is free after all! Keep the good work guys, thank you! | Awesome | No bugs | I have only had great experience with the app I enjoy it immensely and I can text a bit better than before I couldn't say what I was thinking about now I do | It works great | Unfortunately, I Lost all previous photos and texts, when transferring to a new phone. Not sure why but sign in between phones did not work.

Pls fix the camera recording within Signal (Samsung, Android 14) to standard lens or give us an option to select. It defaults to wide angle and is unusable in 90% of cases. Llistening to recorded audio is sometimes super buggy esp. when switching to other chats. It would also help to remember where I left for longer tracks. Lastly, why can't I filter between pics/vids/gifs in media search?"",""nice and secure basic chat app. has a few weird things that you wont encounter often, but are annoying when you do. you have to give someone your phone number for them to message you. transfering accounts between devices usually doesnt work and i have to restore from a backup on yhe new device. for some reason, its impossible to log into multiple android devices with the same account, but its not an issue with the desktop version."",""Signal is just amazing. It works for everything that I need in life. I would rather support it through purchasing extra things like more emojis, greater customization, maybe even a ring tone and txt tone pack. I've donated already but would rather support through even small purchases that enhance or make even more fun the already great app!"",""Not perfect, but constantly improving. On the \""not perfect\"" bucket you have some small but annoying bugs, and controversial features (e.g. integrated crypto currency). If you can live with those, it is a solid and easy to use application that excels at privacy, security and, surprisingly, good video calls compared with other similar apps. Besides it is open source and backed by a non-profit org, both important to me."",""Great app! Wonderful way to connect with friends around the world. My only suggestion for improvement would be to record videos by hitting a button to start recording & then hit a button to stop verses having to hold down the record button the entire time. Also there is an unknown time limit (3 minutes?) where the video recorded is too long to load so it goes away & you have to do it over. It'd be nice to have a countdown to know when we're getting close. Other than that, we love it!

I have to stop CCleaner from my apps list, then of course I don't have any cleaning done at all."",""There are things that I like about this app and things I don't. Perhaps all my complaints would be cured if I could afford the Pro version. Alas, I cannot. This app is great for cutting extraneous data, which certainly does seem to speed things up. However, it continually tries to trim data out of photos and other things that I don't want touched.

I make videos up to 5 minutes long, have done so for years and never had any problems with it so I bought the pro version. Then, after a few months the quality has dropped. It glitches, saves with a grainy blurry tone, buffers during production and has now become a chore to use rather than a pleasure.

I felt safe and enjoyed the ride. | pleasant | So good | Worst app ever they have a lot of harassers and a lot of rude people as drivers they have to take action with this | Really very helpful and enjoyable Uber | Worst App | Doing well | Very nice young man helped with the luggage we arrived in enough time to have a snack. Clean and comfortable car. | Legend | Good Service | Super disappointed try to send a uber to my friend who got stuck out in the middle of nowhere Uber did not think it was me trying to send the ride so it asked for a picture of my ID did not happen to have my ID in hand so did not allow me to send a ride super disappointed definitely do not do not recommend this app zero out of 5 Stars | Corey us very professional and nice | Excellent | Great experience with my Driver ,She is lovey and knows how to treat her clients ,She communities and accommodate everyone she is friendly and she drives safe and you dnt even know or know the trip is far bcz she treats everyone with respect | Excellent | Smooth. No technical issues. | Ok | Sometimes it gets a little bit confused about pickup point's precise address. Doesn't give much time after ride to add tip before it does it automatically. Really... (sigh) | Excellent service | Pool rides are tough when it just keeps extending your ride time. 5 minutes estimated pickup blows out to 30 minutes? Not ideal | Consistent | Excellent | Achhi thi ride | Awesome | Uber keeps crashing. The newest update causes it to not load the trip prices. It is constantly stuck loading until it gives up and crashes forcing me to restart the app. I've tried to clear the cache to no avail. Because of this, I am forced to use Lyft as an alternative even though they charge more the Uber does right now. Please fix the app so I can continue to use your service. Update: It now crashes and logs me out of the app. Why is this happening? | 👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌💯💯💯👈👈👈👌👌 | Good Journey with Uber | Good driver gps had bad directions address was a mile further away | Good | Best service wid affordable price,the app is very useful for us. | It's helpful, thanks | Very good | Thanks uber | The app is great, Uber policy of charging me a $25 reservation fee is insane. Great app, bs fee, won't use again. | Very Good persone Driver Good behaviors person | As we planned uber service was in time and perfect. Also driver Mahadev was very good. | Good service | Very bad service after using promo code drivers are charging same amount before promo code. If you not ready to pay they cancel the ride 🤮🤮 | I left my keys in his car when he dropped me off to pick up my other car from the shop. He took the time to drive them back and drop them off. Great service | Third class app,always overcharging than shown initially ,once raised the dispute ,refunded the amount to app wallet that is again a scam ,you are forced to take a ride again to be scammed again ,third class service ,third class experience second time ....you are forced to pay more all the time you book ,once you reach the destination they will show double charge .and drivers will misbehave.tbey are looting people and big scam is going on. Please don't download this app .I prefer to give 0 ⭐ | Awesome first time using a rideshare since 2017 | Nice app | Is A.C not allowed in uber these days , bcoz drivers are saying that we cannot start A.C due to corona ..is this a valid reason or shall we turn over to ola cabs.. | Excellent | Ok | Shown one amount get one amount | Good | Good 💯 | Soliciți o cursa uberX de 35 de lei și descoperi la final că a costat 50 de lei. | Downloaded the Uber app in an emergency, because our set ride through a shuttle service never showed up... Quickly set up an account, which was easy and then requested a driver...a driver came within 10 minutes and got us to the airport. So we used Uber in the middle of the night landing in Vegas, at 12 midnight and it was again fast and efficient... Way better than seeing up a shuttle. | Awesome 👌 | So good | One of the best chutiyapa app🤬.... ride not to confirm again and again...not for emergency cab.... | Very bad app😠 | Great app, cheapest rides compared to others. | Great service. | This is review section for customer. As most of the customer are facing issues with drivers but who is there for listening drivers 😔 that how much they are offended with uber and facing soo many problems. please once visit in the review section of uber driver app. Customers and drivers are the source of income for them but what they gives to drivers is very less. A driver who works very hard and on the other side a company sitting on the bench they took huge comission from driver and customers. | Now officially sending you the beliefs of my vessel out of the way | Good app and does not cheat for us and also the driver like ola app | Excellent | Very good | Nice | Good | Punctualitate, seriozitate | It's so cool | Awessome | Latest update gets stuck on map screen | It takes a lot of time to find a ride and if one booked, the driver cancels and we have to wait again for couple of mins to get another ride . The app is so unreliable during the time of emergency and if as a user I will cancel it hampers my rating which makes it even difficult to find the ride . I will suggest uber to first make itself as a reliable app so that people dont have to keep multiple travel apps on phone and give customer rating | Thanks to my Driver Micheal. | Very good | Good service | Best | Get out of Minneapolis | Good drive | Excellent driving and conversation. | Thank you fast arrival,approachable driver. | Highly efficient, very fast response, competitive pricing, reliable, good to know price in advance, always have pleasant, professional drivers. | Although my pick-up and normal destination aren't the easiest, there is always a ride available in good time, unlike the competition","{""1"":1291367,""2"":224012,""3"":303075,""4"":856519,""5"":10739431}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Uber Technologies, Inc.","7908612043055486674","Support@uber.com","http://www.uber.com",,"https://www.uber.com/privacy","7908612043055486674","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n109V9dur2NFwV7Fbr8lwlU-isXRR0K7Q-pvp1LCyRwTVP2DfJaR-dklmXzK0MhQuz9E","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-GO7akF9g2nilw7h9eI9pqnbAmHAZXEe9PH4J_YopQjpTfvyVCBiOAHiAZBUrC9uJQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nvMBr7UnGcqV277xoofdcw47g_TxueMzIY6HljhldzzyBGe4kWY3ksPxy7tZCvR5Ww"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SoY4T6n17ZDmH0-Qeav6QZga6rEbG921983rx4hu2bmf37CNLC_PRZA00OoMYcZh8Ys"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/B1_e9LJantVvdiMMBJzw9mJmdNhua2tEBpg5IJgZhQ3JZxa9sksu10vRPtjXFDl_oXw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qN3mL_O4Aram-Qq7nMS-5tDtF8WElbkcFbMB2nPKDdKl_wDSA0jk5dfFfLpi5vlL_nY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ro9ivGg0aekwQLewIr_QkscfQkBayTH15okjhoxOts3cWZuNBsIotPA2Q-e-AP6WwBo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MEDcB-Dovno_lrrWNkbNzRDdGwtlpyiSbLogEnQ-SGQImU8G1-e5YAmMviaKY1mwceA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YhIV2GuIMkZvnBao2-LPPLQZ4QbP0YDj6Kf8YUGe7b7hLvK73LDN_9FL8WdLi-KWH8M"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GjaN9SIde9Wr1egIOySqK98N1aP3qsOhCikd0DxZu3Bdc20inj6OFEkkMbAmFa8-vd4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/spwQmL-z2pyS_7YaOslUXBUUfDzdW4POvIP8PdTWGZCxqwNZZibmXB9l3Ig0mxklbNRH"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Dp0EP2gx7yBjBZjM6bawTvJgFKn7zzFLwaHmgu3lBhAC2oXkfEziRyt-bjx6UPHNHLB-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RXN4_7jmZiejl4vsXLsEGfrC0KE44icVy9WNFlb7QtdvmjPhA57V_P5Mpu_daWBLPvc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/txz3F7UR58q1N1FU9_e8sD2rkqMhxUoj3xVEudBQ1HpmncvsC3s-fAhTMYKLJgvXDw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g0Gzav-WDLEzCz0Lopocbr1xuDmWtjmNYa2wCAj-MujMja2rgvaPKDHD4KTQpt3XbiI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J11ju5hofXNPpOQPwpmbFXpIZDpsTAAUXmQ3ghrd5MV9W3hrM5rPpQhd-jM7NYABhXo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jcul5t4vekHpV9ofUkZDPSZJ0Nd6R3NYWgdEss24suP3uNtHg-Een7W9z3hNcALZLGw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uqsd8-HbC5dat1yalweqk_NJELKlfPjl6brXin3CtxAmbi5K9iQ5xInn1ph67nRdA-6p"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BuDbieoYulbDgK3iXhkZaivsGPxszuzJx-u31Ys6qUhE2NCcEH20Dzn5E2TOKJIUJjw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QOximkObkfKfQWk2PH_f6GwYvr72U0PrfUewRDvZsD-Nj0Wv7vDlvhGZ7Z4Aq9eHNqCm"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tXRUSP-TpVoQ4n8Gz-2wrMac763gwzA9SR5bKGb51tV3Ld-GkXqCQP7HnXRGlSw4q0t1"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7co9QY0BIqowUFlCfh0A0v52PIqYuWfOyG1aRY9UFjtyk3HmHLzBUNIprTk9B4rplw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vvauoz5cJXqcKwNHsIw31xWTe2L87hnss_9L6RU_5jepoEQGuxmxAtb680dyAFpZRg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ll1iean-R9O4-bkPJc9x8M5CWeeZH_styrOXwcxbVIkXgY9rYNtj-IbV0YuJu5zJG8I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KN5BxnAc-wjfONFZIWNNgT-GW9OmnCNU3SdxBVuv0DjitknSDdd7DV8Gv4VEHoVUTw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eRJ8PqXDx900jGIgtMcQokNwvRW9dVDsDPjchgMGyKvkJE0gbb2RveHApLpUEV7mqsE7""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Oct 28, 2010",1710774505000,"VARY","We update the Uber app as often as possible to help make it faster and more reliable for you.

One thing that I don't like: if the driver diverts off the planned path, you still have to pay for the additional miles and tolls. On one of my rides, the driver missed an exit. Uber updated my charge to reflect the additional miles and toll without giving me the option to reject the additional charge. So, as annoying as it might be, watch the driver and remind them of upcoming exits."",""The app doesn't give correct times for pickup or arrival. This causes issues with constantly being late or having to go out of my way to be early when I use it. Maybe Uber gives shorter times to get more rides but it definitely is not worth the cost if you're waiting 3x as long. The app is slow. The fees go up but drivers are still desperate for tips. The fees aren't going to the drivers. The great \""low cost\"" ride ends up being double after fees, taxes, and tip."",""It would be a lot better if the app actually opened correctly and looked how it's supposed to. Sometimes it opens correctly and I see the option for rides and delivery, and it has safety features and such. Other times, it's like I get a basic version of the app. It barely has any functions other than choosing a ride. On top of all of this, I can't seem to find any kind of Uber technical support, so I can't even talk about my issue with someone."",""There was an issue with the app, and the driver was an hour early. I had to cancel and rebook and the price was £10 higher. And now they charged me £29 cancellation fee on top of that. I looked up the email address on the app to let Uber know about the glitch in their app, and it is an email address tha isn't monitored. That's the worst customer service I've experienced in a long time. So 1*."",""There is an ongoing issue with your maps and the directions to your drivers.My pickup locations, both to and from work constantly show that (The driver will arrive across the street from your pick up spot) Problem is, there is no \""across the street.\"" Not at my home or work location.
