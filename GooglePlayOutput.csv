Sealed and safe.... | excellent value for money | Great prices xx | I love it is so good | LOVE TEMU!!!! Probably love it TOOOO much! My students definitely love that I love Temu... not so much my husband though! ;) | All atam is poor no good quality | the worst app ever, such bad quality, not expected like in pictures and much more | If you don't mind the spinning wheel that claims to give you savings or the gimmicky pop ups notification that constantly send you products you may not want, this app might be just for you. Me on the other hand just like to browse the items I want with no pushy ads. | Use wish instead | Paschal Brinson Great products always seeing something new and exciting from the website | Absolutely fabulous company . super value. Only one problem no cotton clothing. Everything else in my mind is perfect! | very good prices nice clothes will continue to buy from here I love there wide pants so nice and long | Best online store ever. | great products like the app | This is a great and loyal company,I'm happy so far, keep up the good service🙏💃🙏❤️ | DON'T INSTALL THIS APP IT'S A BIG SCAM IT WILL HACK INTO YOUR Bank account | I'm literally so angry I had been playing fish land and farmland asked me to make purchases to claim fish food and water I spent over R1300 on my purchases and got nothing also for my 8 free gifts spent hours sharing and just when I was short R3 more to claim my gifts then the time expired I believe this is all just a scam to make us get installers but we get false promises I'm so so angry and disappointed don't even deserve a star also was promised R4000 coupon to download but it's a scam | App is good and cheap.. however the courier is the problem specially j&t.. the rider has own decision when it will be deliver. | Good service and the products are good quality and very affordable 👌 | Love Temu. Some great stuff for kids and adults alike. Some items are smaller than they appear but most items are well worth the price. | Good stuff for good money | Very good apps,👍 | Raja shahmeer Janjua | Trying too tell family members about TEMU also friends they ask have I got any Free things well I pay all my items it's great deals I wish I could get Christmas 🎁 free or birthday in January free .... | Unusable, it kept asking me to finish the security verification over and over again and I couldn't click on anything. Plus it doesn't work in India and the costs are shown for Temu UK | The items are good but the delivery is super slow. I can make a lot of orders in other apps and can be delivered faster than temu. I am sorry to say this but please fix this issue. I want to order more but I'm getting impatient in the slow delivery. | it is a great company | I'm addicted😝. Awesome service, products great, prices unbelievable low...I STRONGLY recommend TEMU👌👌👌 | it's got everything that u need and so far I love everything that I have gotten from temu | The only focus on the the j&t delivery method is horrible. | loved it, thank you!! | Not good a good quality hose. gets kinks and got a leak | this is the best app | App is nice but so many emails and pop ups are irritating | So much to choose from at great prices. | How was it. | I'm really pleased with all the items purchased and prices. | I'm enjoying the leather sofa shoes brought for me andmom I love your adult women sleep wear thank you and God bless you And your family I ha d death in my family that's why you haven't Heard from me thank y fr keeping me updated I'm having problems signing back in I get my granddaughter to help me | I won 10 free items. But when I went to checkout they wanted me to buy a few more items. So when I checked my order yesterday when I was busy, I could only see the 5 items, so this app is just trying to scam you out of your money. Such a waste as I thought I was lucky or something. This is what they do. Don't trust this app. | Great products at a great price 👍 | لا يستحق مضيعة للوقت و منتجات سيئة و وصف غير صحيح للمنتج | Great online store and very secure in terms of payments!! | Items are what you see on the website and not irregular or cheap knock offs, delivery is very timely usually arrive early. | enjoying the quick and easy to use app. | good quality | legit | Absolute garbage.... its like wish but with more popups and scams | My package come wet and ripped when I opened my package all the stuff I had ordered was destroyed so I had ask the delivery driver what happened to my package he said that he's supervisor gave it to him and said just tape it up. My order was 3 shirts, a pair of shoes, A ying yang bracelet, 4 shorts, earrings and airpods but my shorts never ended up coming and my airpods I had lost $117 . | Great bargains but make sure you read the description and have the correct option selected if there's a drop down menu when you click on a item you like. Even get $ back if the price reduces after buying an item, that's pretty cool | Temu is bad. They make sweat shop extremely low quality items, lie to customers, and all this is in name of hypercapitalism. Do not support this app! | We want to win free stuff | very pleased with items I have purchased at very competitive prices. | Love Temu! | Worst experience ever. Temu is a scam | Excellent app where you can buy anything at a fraction of the price. I've bought all kinds of things and they haven't disappointed. Just don't ever accept messages from them, as those are charged. | Great site lots of great bits | False advertising. | Good | 👌 perfect coordination,exactness of purchases | prices are affordable especially when you a small business owner and wanting gifts that is still good quality for family or friends. | just love the products & worth the money | It's my favorite app | I have already made my wish obvious to never see this company's adverts! | best website I've ever used. never had a problem so far | Very good 👍 👏 👌 | I'm really disappointed about this app i don't advice you guys to use it bcs most of the items i ordered do not much the description in the app than i tried to return it as they says it refunds free but no one contact me until now it's more than one month btw it's written there withting 15 days they contact me but now it's seems cancelled | Very happy to be able to shop and actually find clothing that fits well. | it's great, as long as you check all the fine print on the item your buying, make sure you measure yourself for size fit on clothes, and read the reviews before you buy and you'll have a good experience with the app. | so far everything I ordered from temu is exactly what I got and lasted longer than the usa retailer's and the shipping for me was extremely fast | Never had any problems. I am always happy with my purchases. | The products are of good quality, exactly as described and delivered quicker than expected. Highly recommend | Excellent communications, great tracking and great products at a good price. | Temu is the best place to get what you need and great quality. | Always find something I MUST HAVE 😁 ... and Free Delivery is an absolute bonus.

I reached 99.99 thrn on my last day to finish it .It went back to 99.93, meaning i have to spend more just to get points. Seriously??? Yeah, Im marking it a spam | I love their clothes | I've ordered for the first time at Shein and my order was divided still waiting on the rest of my order | Excellent | So annoying. The ads are so long and it takes forever to x out of them. I really think your ads are an invasion of privacy. | 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 | هدايا كذب | Farhina Asanil | Horrible app for referrals | Sheins going to just say contact customer service, to save face. The games you play to win items are scams. And points system is rigged so you can't win anything. Just use it to shop , winning coupons means nothing If you have to spent almost 200 to save 15 dollars etc. Also shein x designers (mcall etc) only makes clothing for up to size L who is that empowering? Make plus sizes even for collabs like that. Friends are telling me to try CIDER. | Great value | I love the app so much but ever since they have the latest update. The points and coupons aren't that big anymore. | Idk and Idc 😑 | It was awful. It was a scam. | What you see is what you get | Sweet deals | Nice app | Shopper Hearst... | 😆😆😆 | The Shipping Charges very high I don't like this app due to highly shipping charges and also COD Charges are very high so if you want to purchase for 10 dollars so it will be 30 to 40 dollar due to the stupid charges | Fake gifts and fake discounts never expected this from them so cheaty i donot recommend it i am no longer their customer | Not very helpful on the lose of my order, still waiting for someone to sort out the items | Child labor. | All of the clothes on this app are not the same fabric as in the picture and most of them don't even have straight seams | The app plays games and makes you think you're about to win something which is impossible. Total rip off. | LOVE IT | كذابين الدعم حقكم مايفيد بشي ولا الايميل جاب نتيجه | Not recommended fake gifts a big lie about free stuff u have keep inviting ut friends and still don't get the free items | Very good quality 👌 | I don't really know about the app cos there are so many challenges for a Nigerian using the app, first the shipping free is Soo high it would start a business for me,and also it's not in my country's currency,please it should be improved | I really like your products the quality are good they look like those branded products how I wish I can get your free gifts and trial it excites me☺️ | I love it and I buy something thinks but sometimes it takes a while to come | They're scamming money hungry hotdog water drinkers | Satisfied | UPDATE!!! There is absolutely no way to contact an actual live person on this website. I'm disputing the charges with my bank. My 1st time giving Shein a try and I'm not happy at all. It seems as if my items are being shipped separately instead of in one package and this is a HUGE INCONVENIENCE. Not to mention I can't get in touch with any customer service reps! | Scam. Locked me out of a game instead of giving me my rewards | Very bad application, I am buying a sunglasses and see the price 11 riyals,, paying online 41 riyals deducted, very sad thing, | Blessed | I ove this app but only bad thing are the games they cheat. I had lile 5 ppl help me and it still wasnt enough i tried different games and their all the same . | I love it | I'm missing some points, can anyone tell me why? | I love it | Good | Showing menu in curve section | SHIEN IS SO🤭🤭😍😍🥰🥰😼🥀🤘🏽🥀😼 | The event is always a clickbait and scam. Cheap clothes for expensive prices. | NOT IMPRESSED !! NOT HAPPY WITH ALL THE SPENDING I HAVE DONE,LACK OF REFUNDS,SOLD OUT ITEMS & NO SUPPORT FROM A COUIER?? I WANT IS ALL THESE ERROR REPAYING IN ALL MY REGARDS & THANKS !I😊 🙏 SORRY NO E-MAIL INUSE, CALL or MESSAGES. | They are so stingy I don't like them so by falisha y'all have stinky your nose up | Good | Horrible i ordered braclets pack and it came so wrong | Nice | Good | Bad customer service, they don't know how to answer or what to do, the free transport do not exist, they use a company don't cover all areas | This is a loving app where you could get goooood things to add to your lifestyle like it's amazing temu can't have a chance with this app | Very good | I love everything about this shop it contains a good fishion sense ❤️ | The best over and prices | Very good quality, some of them are cheap and some of them are expensive, the cotton of the clothes is very good and when is expensive when it's good and it's very good drawing and painting is very good . | Best shopping app ever better than temy which is nothing even it's ads are bad.But shein is a whole new level good materials cheap,fast,you can get points so easily so good I love this app you can find any thing in your size and style like my style is coquette and y2k and baggy like all korean styles I love it it's so good the best app ever I HIGHLY recommend this app it's wayyyyy..Better than temu so good in every thing like style,price,shipping, deals everything I support shein in all costs!✨ | Shein has been the best shopping app. Great items with excellent prices. I love all the clothes. It doesnt matter what your style is. Shein has stuff for everyone and every style. Shein never disappoints. My #1 shopping app!!!! Love ya Shein!!!! | 🥰 perfect | Nice | Horrible | After purchasing a product from Shein using my credit card, my credit card got hacked and was used for unauthorized transactions worth almost 400USD. Their app or website is NOT SAFE for online payments. Never buying again from SHEIN!! 🤢🤢🤮🤮👎👎 | Bulok na app walang kwenta hayop | App buôn bán những mặt hàng kém chất lượng nhất thế giới. Toàn những thứ bỏ đi, tôi đã đặt 3 đơn hàng với các loại mĩ phẩm, quần áo. Không cái nào có thể dùng được: - Mĩ phẩm: các loại serum với tinh chất khác nhau, công dụng khác nhau ..nhưng có chung 1 mùi hăng hắc, chai nhựa rẻ tiền, nhãn sai chính tả, không có 1 chút hiệu quả nào. - Quần áo: toàn là sợi nilon, sợi công nghiệp nóng bức, mỏng dính, bí bách, chỉ thừa tùm lum. KÉM - DỎM - XẤU | Scammers they offer all these promotions offer free gifts make you jump through hoops to get them and then they don't work it's pure scam artists ****you cannot talk to an actual person in customer service it's all AI generated bot chat with pre selected questions. If you select the option for games for free prizes it ""fails"" and doesn't work. So your response is stupid and I stand by saying they are scammers. | Good deals but shipping is too much most times. If shipping was free I'd order every week. | Lovely wish they had Cases for every phone haven seen or found a tcl ion x phone case well gladly buy from SHEIN. | 🥰🥰🥰🥰 | Very great. | Everything is good quality cheap prices and fast delivery | Really good up | Just now only delay my order I order April 6,2024 until now I'm still waiting omg what happened Shien please | This so distrubing | lee sar chin tal | Great app. | excellent | It's a scam | Well I have not ever received what they said review and keep ?? | good | YOU CAN SAVE MONEY ...You can buy cheap product ,Cost paid Don't expect delivery it would not come ON TIME AND CORRECT ADDRESS...... LIVE IN FRUSTRATION....... | nice app | Took to long to get here | Like it | Don't recommend it for any one with family they keep showing sex toys and my family they could open the app to look to buy something | Felt sad about the daily check in. Keeps on deducting! I'm already tired of logging in everyday then it keeps on deducting and deducting. So it's still useless pfft. Ps. BEFORE was REALLY BETTER. Please fix this! | They require so much. The new one needs to be verified by sending codes. How am I supposed to sign in to my account that used to be on my old phone? Also, customer service doesn't work unless you're signed in. What kind of service is that? I can't even sign in because you're asking for a code from my Gmail account that used to be on my old phone. | Nice | Prices are affordable, quality of product are amazing. Not regrets yet. Updated 4/25/24 The customer service is horrible, Werth my late order I ran into an issue..nothing major, however the customer service or BOT turn this into a major issue.

Luckily customer service usually gets the problem taken care of so thank you for that. | nice | I'll know more when I get cash from it | 👍 | the best money transfer in America | It has always been convenient for me as I have children that don't live here and we often do transfers | Just as many people here, the app doesn't even let me open an acc, just because I'm in the UK. It just gives a message saying that ""Sorry you can't sign in at this time"". At this point, having seen how many people are having the same issue, I think it's obvious, that the problem isn't with the us, but with the app in some way shape or form... Be it the connection, something in the programing, or whatever, there is a problem with this app for many people in the UK... I hope you can fix it... | It's great 😃 | good but no as efficient as it could be | Love Cash App | 🤩 | I like that you can lock the card, but they took away the ability to load paper money. | bussin app | quick and responsive | I just want to take surveys and get cards and it download onto my cash app I | it's cool | I have wrongful sent cash to wrong persons I was told by cash alp request my funds back by mail like so real that why I give 4 star~Just Saying Lady Katherine Ivey | They stole money from me twice and I'm not no fool | Everything has been smooth & easy..so helpful to me! | Absolutely Garbage customer service, brand new to the app, all they send me is make sure the debit card is in your name which it is, build up a transaction history, how if my payments don't work to begin with, and only send money to people you know.

"Telegram","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices.

"Threads, an Instagram app","Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Open social networking – coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

For sure not recommended for download. | ADD SOUND | Lol I just installed it. And the very first screen was a non closable 30 second add.

It's just a horrible, toxic online space | this a great entertainment app a Time killer plus really funny stuff wish I could review some of their videos get the app | I like it | Mostly funny pictures but lately it's sending messages that are pornography Unsolicited | Just get Ifunny | Good app | If you are misogynistic, lecherous conservative cultists. This app is for you. | Nothing but right wing/Trump memes and soft core p*rn | I find the videos interesting. | Sorry... I'm older than a 13 year old... | It's not worth the download, just more brainrot content | This app is trash. Tons of spam, and a breeding ground for dumb conservative talking points, that make zero sense. Would give it negative stars if I could. Also, if you wanna see risky stuff, you can literally find it anywhere else | Trash tik tok recommended | This app is filled with people who use the app to spread their homophobic, racism and other hate filled beliefs. I found nothing funny on this app just a bunch of political propaganda encouraging people to hate others because of their sexual preferences, religious beliefs, color of their skin and their nationality. I do not think that this app is monitored in any way because of the foul language used by most of the people who are posting. | I used the app for 10 minutes. In that time, I was repeatedly shown NSFW imagery followed by conservative memes and imagery in a pattern. It seems to be a dopamine attack on its user base. Propaganda app DO NOT download. | The navigation makes no sense. The search yielded no results. A waste of time | I like it | remember people that a picture says alot about a person and their state of mind and soul, remember that we are held accountable for all we say and do, God is always looking for someone who is humble in their ways, so he can raise you up to a higher level of knowledge and knowing, to be called his son or daughter,can you answer the call to be holy as he is. I am David candle king...... | I like. | exceptional | This must be an adult app. Most of the stuff on here is nearly nude. | ads everywhere | Great App | didn't enjoy it. I had no idea it was just another platform for half nudity | One gorgeous woman! | If you are above the age of 45, ignore my 1star review and download this app. You'll love it. For the rest of us, this app is complete trash and feels like it's simultaneously ripping off every major social media and doing all of it poorly. | freedom of speech | I had to repeat the login in 7 time, work on your app asap if you want people to like it | it's great entertainment | They want a credit card to blast you with ads. Couldn't think of anything more stupid than that. | Totally sucks. Outrageous amount of adds. Full of Conservative BS. Good for Trumptards only. | would be nice if they had a search button can't seem to find one | Awesome | awesome | good | it's OK not really","{""1"":8884,""2"":4447,""3"":18269,""4"":36232,""5"":119113}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.99 - $4.49 per item","8.0","8.0","VARY","FUNTECH PUBLISHING LTD","FUNTECH+PUBLISHING+LTD","support@americasbestpics.com","https://americasbestpics.com","Digeni Akrita, 1, Blue Ocean

They have everyyything. | so easy and best prices and variety | online orders for pickup save so much time. I love seeing my usual items, which makes shopping so easy. | Search for coffee maker and if i select to show from cheapest to most expensive all the Mr. Coffee listings disappear. ???? | Love this app | The price was reasonable, I think this was a better option than the marketplace this time. | I love Wal-Mart. Ordering is a breeze and the prices are great! | Love Walmart and the Walmart app too. Lots of good stuff to buy here too. Updates were nice also thanks so mooch.. | walmart app is the best | excellent! | EASY... | awesome to shop and use | most of the time they get it right. | awesome | Walmart is the best place to shop and it's fun to shop there as well | I honestly love this app. I never have any issues! | easy to shop! | fast and manageable. | great service store workers are great. | Great | Horrible place! Prices have gone up to surpass all the other stores. I tried to cancel an order by app & by phone that they provided substitutions that I didn't ask for. They said I had to come to the store. Said it would take 10 business days to be treated for their screw up! The order was supposed to be shipped. They would change or cancel! Don't even get me started on having to check out my own groceries then chasing me out the door to check my receipt! Shame on you Walmart! DO BETTER!! | Nice way to buy | Thank you! | because you guys can't cancel my order | So useful as a mom! Walmart+ is 100% better than Target. I love it. | just placed 8:53pm 4/26/24 hoping all goes well with my order. | The app only works sometimes at my mobile gas station. It used to work such that when I pulled into my gas station and open the app it automatically offered me to buy gas. It does that now but pushing on the app for seed does nothing. So today I tried to use the scan function. Which seem to work, but when I entered the pump number the app says, something went wrong. I found this app hit and miss at best. It used to work fine months ago but no longer. | showed buy now price and when added to cart price more than tripled | Why can't I use my fuel benefit??? It's been down for a week now!!! | I like ordering stuff from Walmart. It never takes long and always comes. 😃 | I had to pay for clearance items at the register... | Great app very helpful | I don't even have to go to the store. I placed an order in the Walmart app, and it arrives in a week! | I had to go through chat to speak with someone over the phone. I made an order via Walmart website, and they took the money off of my card and then the next day sent me a text stating they could not deliver the item. I was upset but after finally getting through to customer service the delivery issue was resolved, and I am very satisfied, although it takes too long to put my money back on my card, 10 business days! | Everything was simple to use and straight to point. | nice | I love 💖 | The Walmart delivery option is a very convenient privilege to be a part of. Thank you everyone for being so thorough and polite. | love ordering and then picking up item | good 👍 | best | Liritaly doesn't let me order anymore it automatically cancels it | Have trouble getting to my account to verify my credit card number | easy and reasonable | love how u can shop online and get it delivered to your door | I would avoid this service till Walmart does something effective to reduce the number of fraudulent accounts users. I have had two deliveries by very questionable drivers. I have told my family to never let the drivers in the house or open the door till they leave. Reply to developer yeah that link isn't leading to anything. How about IDing the drivers when they pick up orders and stop treating honest drivers as disposable. | I shouldn't have to download an app to pick something up. | Very easy to use. | I love the ease it is to be able to pick up any device and finish my order to be ready for when I arrive home. the customer service is beyond amazing and ability to be able to even talk to them is fantastice | I absolutely love the app so easy to use! | keeps trying to close | great app 👌 👏 | if I get this Sunday | Easy | DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING THAT IS NOT SOLD AT WALMART. . . 3RD PARTY WILL TAKE YOUR INFORMATION CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND SELL IT TO SOMEONE OVER SEAS AND TRY TO MAX OUT YOUR CARD. MINE WAS USED AT AN AIR B N B AND A JEWELERY WEBSITE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. DONT KEEP YOUR INFORMATION ON FILE!!!! | gpod deals | first time using the service. App is easy to use. | Walmart is my home away from home. They always have what I need. I really appreciate that my deliveries arrived at the expected date. I love Walmart. | Thank you | first time trying | worked very well...thank you | The price online is higher than when you go to the store.. and the delivery fee. | really easy to order stuff on the app and I drive up and pick it up.....so amazing!!! | Extremely easy online ordering process. | just used for the first time and wow,free delivery and I saved 20 bucks.... right on... | 💯 | great app | very helpful | I love being able to shop right from home. | so quick and easy. | 2nd time using app to do curb side pickup. so far this time is going smoothly. I'll update after I pickup. the first time was a huge problem and the day before Thanksgiving 2 years ago what a mess that was. crossing fingers this time. | Good prices and good service | process is easy and convenient | Walmart!!! 😤 | waiting for my first delivery. love it so far. so easy. and I'm old. lol | Awesome | always love Walmart for great prices and always the to have what I need. services good everybody's planet never have any problems expression on returns thank you for that now I'm going shopping at Walmart | Great delivery service 👏 | will give 5 stars when you fix the option to only see items in stock. Currently spend way too much time looking at out of stock items even when I've clicked in stock only | Work in progress (2024) | Easy to use. | Love the delivery options. | awesome and fast | App works well | I love shopping at Walmart | Love It !!! | 1st time. Going to wait and see how it goes. I can't get out of this comment section | My favorite sto buy from I purchase everything from food to shoes. For the family. | I understand the concept of a few bad apples thing... But why is Walmart treating every customer like a thief. I have had to wait by the underwear and socks isles twice for over 20 minutes. Because these items are behind locked windows. 1 time another stocker told me that the person with the key was on break and would be back in half an hour. How about we all start charging Walmart for our personal time for coming inside for a full helping of disrespect. Not every one is a criminal. Except Y'al | Excellent variety of products are Great Prices | This app is pre-installed on my Walmart tablet. It does not work. I don't have the option to uninstall or reinstall it. | Very good | love the convenience and delivery drivers are nice | I'm very pleased with my Walmart deliveries! | wall mart + is the best program savings I LOVE IT | Two thumbs up | easy to use | I'm ill & living with family. When I order & pay for items the products are delivered to the family member, not me. Some of them are personal, but the family member opens my mail before I can. I don't order anything from you anymore because of this. You've lost a good customer. I'm sorry I have to give you the one star in the reviews.","{""1"":84575,""2"":35444,""3"":163391,""4"":567357,""5"":3684482}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Walmart","Walmart","androidapp@walmart.com","https://www.walmart.com",,"http://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/walmart-privacy-policy","Walmart","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lmzTAAyXpuxFvWDEALhYAi2Gn5As_4DIMoh5KezxmqeimkxbOFZYO9ttjRJDA1sdL-0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Hm9KX2vtjzG3mio1nC0IZOKFAN7IVw8hOCJVr2Edqcq4nu5rbl5FCNhiILm9huANhg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cf0XXPl0oSsreKZ8IYp21YRRk2XEd2bimx2uafjpmclpYCg7PZ0Mp4T6Be58ookWWx2d"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dVcriCmdAuOIQ3CQuUbfET6itbj2fR2RUeCpmocFbqMz63TBbG1tueNV-zjZHpya7nRO"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/M4lKc-HvPZ4BlT1evZXszWuDFx8utQTMFbCtG48m561l8Zy9H3IDxDTPQ2lVmi_zv85g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3Ci3KhFe1Z0dGN4bIjG2zFor15sVipyUP8cCk5mcz8o0iNnO-5x2Y42zsd5rZRXpf9U"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0cGzLswLEdqZvaPy8qxZi4ClHigm3Yw7gGRZgrQab6m5ZU0FaSXU4hW9wfz53hquxY-W"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ey0YGgwHPMPhsllslvwjrsc1DJVl3-ykb-0tGAIAgt-hLPqDQkEei_H_UlEGVJoXIpc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AfIZ7dz5rKvUcEBhjqgjF-WFpGPQsNy13RVHaae2fsXLGMtTNyqcAJBqpHfYIrZyNXA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s-zPByii-fUPPuuFAGPm98kCYkDIGTLM0M2QlzepQC-qOo_ag3KSiJsLugJUcECHFPs""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,"May 6, 2011",1714192640000,"24.14","Thanks for using the Walmart app!

I have ordered not thinking there was a change the drive up people ask me for my order everyone is baffled 5 employees tell me oh well we can't find your order so you can just leave instead of making my order only to find it was at the counter cause it switches to pickup which apparently is counter and they cannot see in the app found this out after I tried several locations they confirmed the app is bugged | Check out button is greyed out | Wont let me take anything out the cart | Just Great!!! The food and staff are awesome!!! | They really need to fix how to login! Everytime you try it tries to register and because you already are it wont let you do anything. The login and register needs to be separate if they can't make it work right! It's been over a year since I deleted. So decided to get the app back...still has this issue and no deleting and re-downloading does not help. Just automatically wants to register and not let you login. Yes I will be reaching out. But over a year and still not fixed this is crazy. | Everything is so fresh and Hot, Great Customer Service. The guy Lederic in Drive thru is Awesome. | love it all | nice | Delivery time is never accurate and there is no customer service for u to get anything resolved | Pros: -Discounts are nice. Cons: - unable to use gift cards with app. - If you select wrong location when redeeming rewards, unable to cancel that order and the restaurant it was ordered at cannot either. - the phone that is used to place the order must be brought to the restaurant in order to pick up the order. It's detected by location. In other words, don't send anyone else to pick it up for you, they will not be able to even with the code, unless they have your phone with them. | I likemcDsnow! | Trouble with the app across the USA ... they are working on it. | Sweet Tea and mocha delicious 😋 | Love McDonalds! | A little slow and clunky. | Great deals | Yummy. | I placed my first order using the app for pick up at the Spring Rd SE location in Smyrna GA. When I picked up the order and arrived at my hotel, I realized I was missing half the order. I ordered a 2 cheeseburger meal and they didn't bother to include the cheeseburgers. Additionally, there is no method of resolution through the app. You are told to contact the store, accept in this case the number was disconnected. McDoanlds has terrible service nation wide.. | Cannot state what mobile pick up spot I'm in or Mobile code because the app closes and immediately goes to receipt. | Hungy | Won't record recpts, tells me to connect to the internet, while I'm already connected to the internet. Tried reinstalling it and clearing the cache, nothing seemed to help. I give up not worth the hassle. They offered help, I tried but that didn't work either. Thankfully Burger King is close. | sometimes takes long to load, but overall great app. coffee deal didn't load for over 2 months for me, then one day popped up. that was my worst problem. | works for me | saves me time but not had long time will tell but so far so go | I love the McDonald's app. They have amazing deals and rewards! It's a great way to stretch your money! | went smoothly. meal was hot. | good app easy to use | Frequently hangs/crashes when you go to pay, both on wi-fi and cellular, never know if it has charged you multiple times for the same order until you check to make sure. | This is amazing out system | The whole purpose of the app is to make things fast and easy. I used it to place an order so the order was ready when I got there. It wasn't, and I was asked to pull to the front of the store to wait for my order. When we got our food and got home we were missing food. I called the store, and the manger told me to contact the customer service line to be refunded because I paid through the app. I called the customer service told the credit needs come from the store. 4 days later nothing | easy to use and good deals on food | Does not let you choose the location you receive deliveries from. At all. And then one hundred hoops to jump thru just to get a partial refund. Cart/order bag stalls and claims it's got stuff in it when it really doesn't. I keep it for point tracking but rarely have time to go to the restaurants. It's an ok reminder on deals or promotions/times of operation for locations. | points should not expire! | McDonald's app is great!! 👏👍👍 | Awesome.deals | The cashier was happy to help me when I had a difficult time using the app. The manager was friendly and the store was very clean!! | After changing phones, I was able to use this app again. However, it would be nice to see more customization on items IE: light ice, add more condiments, produce, and protein choices on items from all menus. Or being able to swap folded/round eggs. It would also be nice to use my rewards with my coupons instead of having to go around twice. Most other fast food apps let you use your coupon with your rewards. It's pretty time-consuming on both I and the employees. Get with the times mcdonald's. | App is the best!!! Keep it up MickieD | I love this app. Saved me lots of $$$! | Trying to get delivery from local McDonald's and won't allow me to . Says it can't find me | if you don't have this app you're not cool | App is buggy. Lots of crashing. App is too busy pushing out annoying pop-ups to do itamaon function correctly | Terrible. Never used points ever because you can only use one at a time, and are useless. | App is having problems on and off. I've tried deleting and reinstalling and still no luck. After going the the setup/sign in menu it stops working I can't tap anywhere on the app to get it to do anything. | Great | Great","{""1"":48645,""2"":12068,""3"":51015,""4"":238019,""5"":1542191}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","McDonalds USA, LLC","McDonalds+USA,+LLC","mobileappfeedback@us.mcd.com","http://www.mcdonalds.com",,"https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/privacy-overview.html","McDonalds+USA,+LLC","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hSRuCp9qVkxNYLYibPYyra4bQLYDyHg40TA1Cu6i9Z3HsWEgS1q076VfjacAdQquHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fs0dZBx3BBXEgrY1g_GazmSNUnXVkAhdEzU-g3kfly2geka55k4L6gNZ31uK0b-KG8g","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fLj9CyHviIDt9l7p0W7ncJES93IT_D1yCGgG6CoufSoNcKUUGFNaNedO8yR9KAbAYqA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/71j-6R7wC7Ss3Imti3NJkvUOpHk9EDe9BUqJEEBIwBwKXtjWa3ubBqQaGSpw8Gb79g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PiBmTBmj__57Zs4y2GujQ7PC2DOsdld__fUGvusU8YFaSHLUb9RpDWeh9mhMlMqOYt4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oMGhQyU87wvmDSpbJPqe6tKKxVRU2qOJBUkJjEMUxOz1BElTwIPo-DXo2GUqSDrvJyA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FfJi6liqpcZXqSt-b447UAz4501qSA5uF665Lxvpc21c1OYj_NeBd-HFsU7g6ld0sA""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gF--UflL_A?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fs0dZBx3BBXEgrY1g_GazmSNUnXVkAhdEzU-g3kfly2geka55k4L6gNZ31uK0b-KG8g",,"Everyone",,false,"Oct 24, 2014",1711035228000,"8.1.0","Hi bestie, <br>Now get your faves delivered—and earn points—with McDelivery through the app. As always, we’ve made other updates to enhance your experience. <br>Hope you’ll enjoy ✌️","[null]",false,false,false,"com.mcdonalds.app","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcdonalds.app&hl=en&gl=US"

What's even worse is that the ads lie about the capabilities of this app. In the ad it shows someone using different emojis and erasing parts of them, and saving it to there phones emoji system; which you cannot do in the real game! And there are constant ads every 30-45 Seconds! And most of the accessories are just cartoonish and not like real emojis! | Eyes are messed up hard to make emojis lots of adds | Bro this sucks can't even put the stuff where I want to put it without making it bigger. And when I tried to grab thing I'm trying to move it makes you grab a different thing. Also when I'm trying to edit it it puts me on my home screen. So please fix this game 😭. | Very funny the game that you can change your avatar | one problem is that it won't show when I try to Type it in | This is the most worst game ever!!! I hate this game! The ads are false!!! I don't recommend!!!! | i love it | It is very good and legit. You will get addicted no time | I hate this app, I think that it's a new app? It's just a new app | 𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕒𝕕𝕤 𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕗𝕒𝕤𝕝𝕖 𝕒𝕤𝕧𝕖𝕣𝕥𝕚𝕤𝕖𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥 (𝕤𝕣𝕣𝕪 𝕚𝕞 𝕔𝕦𝕣𝕣𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕝𝕪 𝕠𝕟 𝕒 𝕨𝕒𝕝𝕜 𝕥𝕠 𝕞𝕪 𝕤𝕡𝕖𝕝𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕚𝕤 𝕓𝕒𝕕 𝕝𝕞𝕒𝕠 | Boring | love it | Make there less ads | I think the sticker are cute 😍 | It was a very fun and entertaining experience 😄 | It never let's me create anything! It's just so annoying that I'm deleting it so bye | It looks nothing like the ad it's so Bad | I looked at some reviwe thath say this app horible so make sure to check reviews | Bad | I love it it's so fun and really nice | ORGANIZATION | Not a good game, not the worst but still bad. This games ads STEAL from other content creators from tiktok/youtube, etc, plus it is NOTHING like the ads, trashy emoji creator, and stealing drom other people to clickbait, plus very limited accesorys, dont think i can even USE the emojis cause it shows someone on tiktok making the emoji then being able to post it on a comment+IT ISNT EVEN THE SAME EDITOR. This game is straight dumpster fire, if i could give it 1.5 stars i would. Stop ad-baiting. | I thought I was gonna be just like the ad I really don't like this game, I thought I would actually have to make my own emoji, but I can't, I just have to use the things that gave me and the emoji just look terrible | I like this emoji | DUDE IT DOESNT LET YOU CUT AND DO ALL THE STUFF IN THE ADS >:( | It was nothing like the ads i got so hiped up for nothing | It will not let me make my own now Idk why | I want to rate it a zero, it's so bad. I couldn't even press on anything, and before I could even do anything an add pops up?! | My daughter downloaded this app and then she immediately wanted to delete it. She wanted this review to be posted so everyone knows how bad this app is. The ads show that you can cut out the faces from images and replace them with other but that option does not work. The ad specifically shows this function but the app does not permit you to do this, that is false advertisement. We DO NOT RECOMMEND | This game is kind of fun 😊😁 | NOT GOOD APP . Loads of ads and NOT EVEN REAL PHOnE EMOJIS JUST FAKE DONT PLAY WASTE OF TIME | It's the best app! | It does nothing it's a paperweight app | Too many ads | So much for | great, but a lot of ads. | It doesn't even keep your emoji 😭😭 😭😭 | Isn't real. All that needs to be said | This app is horribale. FALSE ADVERTISMENT! its not the real thing here is what it is. it is a app where trash thing happen. dont ever get this app. its not even real emojies its saves to your gallery or photos its a image and its anoying to use then it ask for money like no thanks. 0/10 dont recomend unless you are looking for trash apps | Great idea but it would be nice if you could let me use the emojjis on messenger? | Terrible it keeps on stopping when i open it. | Mostly when I started I had no idea what I was doing and it ceep loading for a long time and mostly wheni tried to create a emoji it took me of the game and I nearly broke something. | When I downloaded the app, and I clicked on create, it just stopped working. Also when I was about to save the emoji so I can show it to my family and friends, it just logged me out. ( If you know what I mean) | best ever lol I will play it for a hour!!!!! | ℍ𝕒𝕤 𝕥𝕠 𝕨𝕒𝕥𝕔𝕙 𝕒𝕕𝕤 𝕥𝕠 𝕘𝕖𝕥 𝕤𝕥𝕦𝕗𝕗 | I don't really like it because on ads it shows that you can 'make' your own emojis but you aren't so it's basically a scam | I love this app it like describes you and you can make ANY tape of emojis! | I can't even get into thegame too much adds | work don't get it | It wouldn't work no matter what I did. I'm only putting it all the way at 1 star because it's the only way to write this. I think that what the app was supposed to do was really cool... but if it doesn't even work then... | You can't make your own emojis and stickers, and there's only stickers, and too many ads, don't recommend this sh!ty app | YOU DON'T EVEN GET THE EMOJIS ON YOUR KEYBOARD SO 0 | NO STARS NOT WHAT THE AD SED IT WAS!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 | it's a fun game 🎮 to play when ur bored decorating different cute pictures 📸 | It has almost zero good options and just wasted time watching ads | It's a really good game to play | LOVE IT(but can't use it not the app the face | Great app. | I couldn't click on a thing! I tried to go into ""create"" and.. It didn't change my screen! | good | Great app! I tried using on Chromebook and it worked perfectly, and its still very fun to test your creativity! Much easier then attempting it on a free art app. | In Never happened.nin1984 | Fun | this app is a 100% good | Nothing but a loading screen. | I don't like the way it is created by the way it is clickbait | it is really. fun and great for kids | There is a lot of adds and I keep having to re load the app. You can't use them in ur keyboard emojis and they don't save you can share them to other apps as a picture not an Emoji. Overall I would say a 3 star is for the use of mixing emojis and sending pics of the emojis but also for the adds that come with this app x | When I go on it on it it will not load | DID NOT WORK AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😡😡😡 AND I HATE NORMAL EMOJIS!!!!!!😡😭😡😭😡😭😭😭😭😭😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 AND IT LOOKS SOOOoO FUN😡😡😭😭😭 | TERRIBLE! It's all laggy, once I get an add it takes me to the play store and when I go back it resets the app, it makes me click on the continue button for so long to open, its slow, and it's just annoying all the time it frustrated you and it's nothing like the ads. Do yourself a favour and don't download this. | Garbage I couldn't make emojis and broken | Doesn't work | This app sucks | This app was nothing like the ads. Nothing in the ads is in the actual app, like hearts and these specific eyes like this dude made in the ad (he made a emoji face cat or whatever it's called). Sick advertising, totally like it was advertised. | good | I hate it | This is the worst app so many ads it was no point of download The app it's not working or not fun at all the commercial made It looked so fun it's a scam like for real don't download it don't The commercial said it's make emojis fun no it don't do don't do it for your own safety | It has cute emoji is and you can send it to apps and stuff but on the advertisment I thought you could make your own emoji. I was pretty dissapointed | this game was good and it was really cool 😎 | Will not work | Very nice and fun 😄 | Ok soo I always se ads like this and IV been seeing it ALL OVER THE INTERNET and it's lagging (just what I want is too limit the ads I'm playing a game and all the ads I see is emoji stitch) | You make the emojis and you don't get to use them when you're texting people it doesn't make sense an saying this and I'm on my grandma's phone ok don't mind this but yes One Star ONE STAR DONT PLAY!! | This app is an scam first off all it would never let the emoji load and If it did load it dose not let my put them on my WhatsApp | 100% Recommend | I think this app was really good i can create all the different types of emojies i want | Theres no axalotal face and stick man legs and im trying to mack kinito pet | It's a fun game I made a cute little spider I live it so much hope you guys to bye I rate it five stars because it's a fun game | Idk how to start💀 | Did they have them on Angel 😇👼🏻 | it's the best thing possible! so cool u guys r beeg brain | So fun but hard to work😃😃😃 | it is so cool because you can make emojis | This is false advertising.

Every week you CHARGED ME. ILL NEVER USE THIS AGAIN | Good and helpful. | No verification code without a subscription plus the ads are terrible and half the time I did not get my text messages. Shutup number 3 | Love it! This TextNow app has been super helpful to me. Thanks! | Take to het | Good | It keeps closing | Texting and calling is good I've been using this app for almost 2 year and haven't had much problems using it 🙃 but why I give it a 4 star review is when you call someone sometimes you can't hear them or they can't hear you and after all that's mainly it if I have more to share I'll let yall know BYEEE!😄 | Very Good | It's me 😺😂 | Text Not Right Now is what it should be called. There's a limit on texting and once you reach that limit, you're limited..... stopped actually..... from being able to text at all. God forbid you're kidnapped and need to send a group text in hopes that someone, anyone gets your msg and can rescue you. Forget about it! You're cooked! | Love it, | Awesome 👍 | It works fine and is a bit anoying with adds | Very easy to set up and use, I recommend highly! | I think this is a great app it's extremely useful for me especially during times of struggle. This app has made it possible to stay in contact if I break my phone or if times are tight. I appreciate this app. Very useful | 2024 and still no video calls on the app? I like this app but it's outdated, they only care about monthly subscription | Free music music YouTube | Recommended but don't sign up for it weekly fee, you can't cancel | good | Works great | Great app I would recommend to anyone! 💯🙂 | It's MY thing over any of the phone companies any day or night & in the morning too. | Great text now it helps ... me | Texts did go through on both ends | Good listner@@supporter.. | Relatively painless... Thanks. | Regarding TextNow response: Damage is done there is no redeeming your actions. I deleted this worthless app. I am done! I watch the stupid ads then my phone number was unavailable? After using it for months? Are you kidding me? NO! No, you were serious! If minus stars were a thing I would go -5! No way I would ever recommend this app to anyone!🤬 | Very good app | I try to call my dad it gives me a different person!!! | It's not working for me can't use it | three stars because u dont reacive confirmation codes with this app | I like the app, but recently i am unable ro send text messages to some cell phones. I figured it was due to an update that I missed, but no. I figured that they took away texting to Mexico, but no, i am able to receive messages on my mexicana phone number. So i dont know what is going on. I have force stopped the app. I have restarted my phone and still doesn't work. Help | Love this app | I like this app its good for when you don't have an actual phone yet. | Good communication great for me works beyond perfect like I won't lose numbers so often | Yeah | Won't let me call from this app | Great | good | Great overall | Straight | textnow works good 90% of the time 🙂 | Works well, but as I found out today, even if you use it regularly you can still lose your number without warning, which suuuucks | I had this app 2 yrs ago and it was amazing. The only downside is that it only works while you have wifi only. But they have the option that you can pay for the service. | Everytime I click the call button the app closes.. what is going on?? I need to make calls too | Exc | Good | great | Alwaysworks... idk ifthereare larger things i need to knowtho | Not bad | Its nice to have but definitely has it's issues | Just what I needed | Paid to lock in number so I can use this number to sign up for stuff to protect my personal phone info and it just ate my money and didn't lock in the number. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it just repeats giving me random system messages over other apps say failed to lock in number even though they just took my money and connecting to customer service for a refund is such a headache with this app. Also I've used this one 3 different phones and the calling connection is terrible. | IMO, TEXT NOW IS GOATED ASF, & FASHO COMES THROUGH CLUTCH ASF 😮‍💨🐐🫶🏼 | Great app, I like how they have their own sim cards you can buy hella cheap. | Good 😱🍆 | Awesome cool thanks.. | it's really great to have when you don't have a carrier. only drawback is you have to stay really close to the Wi-Fi in your home. you can't leave the room the tower is in or your phone gets really dicey and the Wi-Fi will drop, so, your call will drop. | this is a very good app. I use it for my tablet and it works great. | Cool, app. A bit glitchy. | UPDATED read all: Text Now is awesome. I often wonder how I have managed without them. I would 100% suggest Text Now to anyone. UPDATE: I have no idea what is wrong with Text Now right now. It is very slow to load and I am now finding that when I am typing a message that before I can even complete the message it disappears on me. This is extremely frustrating to say the least and I do not have time for it. especially when you can't get any answers. Text Now Please FIX ASAP I dont need this. Ty | it was great until they started making you pay $2 a week to get verification codes. absolutely ridiculous, like just logging into stuff uses a verification code | Best phone app ever I love my TextNow number it's very easy to use just like a regular phone and I love the fact that it is not hard to understand the free texting and calling comes in handy especially when I lose my | Loud keyboard | Everything cost a Rediculis amount | I have been using text now for 5 years now. it made me safve above 4000$ | This is a great Textme app. | So. Many. Ads. I have used this app on and off for years and now it keeps telling me to buy a number (i bought one already??) it keeps saying ""unable to verify purchase"" even though i got the original message saying it was confirmed. I thought one of the bonuses of buying a number was no ads?? Now I have to ""lock in"" my number AND pay for no ads? What's the point of the ""premium"" number then?! | How due I get this | Only gave you a star so that I can tell the public about your encrypted malware that kicks people off of programs in their phones and computers. To the public, I am being honest. If this textnow program were a newspaper, I wouldn't put the paper on the floor for fear a dog might want to poop or pee and the damned ink would be laced with dried acid and when wet would burn the dog. | still adds stupid textnow signature even after i deleted it. it even shows on my end that it's not there but thats not what the text sent to my own real number says... | It has adds but it's a great app if you don't have a SIMS car | Awesome | Great app | Great second phone number app. EDIT: This app is still great for texting, but now I can't call. Everytime I try to call any number, it says it can't connect to the network. I have fine connection and it says I don't. This used to be great now it needs to be fixed. | The first problem I'm having is I am unable to attach photos from within the app. I have to go into my gallery and select share from my gallery just to send a photo. Second problem I encounter is randomly I won't receive calls but I will get a missed call notification. Also sometimes my calls won't dial out or connect at all and I get an message about not being able to connect to my network. My husband doesn't have any of these problems. For me this has been very inconsistent/unreliable at times | Haven't had a chance its not coming in my jkk | Itsuck | Too many pop-up ads block access to the screen before I can use it | It didn't give me notifications for my messages and I would always respond late it would also delete messages that I already sent and the person wouldn't get them. | They refuse to talk to you all you can talk to is a bot that keeps asking you the same question over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again for months and months and months | Worst experience ever. Cant make or recive calls. Calls go straight to voicemail without option to answer them. | It's disheartening when a service that started with the noble intention of providing free communication tools evolves into a platform that seems to prioritize revenue over user needs. The shift from a free model to a paid one feels like a betrayal, especially for long-time users who have supported the platform since its inception. It's a stark reminder that in the tech world, ideals can quickly give way to business imperatives, leaving users to navigate the changing digital landscape. | {~¥^Outrageous!} | totally reliable dependable | Ok I've used textnow for years and used to love it. Even now compared to other apps I would still recommend it. However, I'm not sure what's going on with them now. Now I call other textnow people, the sound just stops. the timer keeps going but neither can hear the other. Also, ads pop up in the middle of a call and shuts down the call also blocking audio. People are sending me pictures and videos that I never get and vice versa. My internet is 500mgbs. Def some issues nowadays | good | Really strange, I got a microchip by mail, put it in my phone, got a phone #, and I got play store and some apps, my notes, Bible, Books, stuff like that, play store, but nothing works if it's downloaded ""fresh"", and none of my ""complicated"" apps work, no banking, no social media like ""X"" or Reddit or Pininterest, AND NONE OF MY CALLS or E-MAILS GO THROUGH!!! | I'm facing sign up problem its not working | Love this app, the only app that does what it says the service sometimes is in and out but that's a internet problem im sure other wise I personally love my textnowapp thank you to text now for coming up with a great app. | It's great i just wish it was a way to use it outside | Needs better pick up calling on lock screen | It sucks I tried to use it and it disabled my account for violating terms of use when I bought the SIM card so I hate this app and I want a refund | This app has helped me out more than once. The only thing I haven't been too happy about this time is that there have been a lot more advertisements than before, but I for a free service with almost perfect call quality, I guess it's almost great. | BEST EVER!!

Update April 2024: I mistakenly added the wrong address information to a debit card, and my account was locked. It took me awhile to realize what I had done, but during the authentication process, the support staff in the call center was consistently helpful, polite, and did all they could to help me figure out how dim my bulb 💡 is 🤠 | For some strange reason, the PayPal balance has been removed from the home screen.

I AGREE OF THE TERM OF SERVICE | I tried to pay someone in USA using the friends & family option & chose the exact amount to be received. The amount received was almost $2 short, not what was promised. I had to send money a second time and pay another fee. PayPal is a ripoff and does not deliver as it should UPDATE I have spoken to PayPal who insist that they sent the amount requested. Not sure if this is misrepresentation or fraud but won't be using this company to send money again and giving them a second chance to cheat me. | Can you fix this app because when I try logging in it's refusing even trying to reset my password and email it's refusing | Good experience to transfer and receive money. | nic | Excellent | Fantastic thanks","{""1"":376502,""2"":78415,""3"":126460,""4"":319393,""5"":2286058}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","PayPal Mobile","PayPal+Mobile","app-feedback@paypal.com","https://www.paypal.com/mobile",,"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full","PayPal+Mobile","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bDCkDV64ZPT38q44KBEWgicFt2gDHdYPgCHbA3knlieeYpNqbliEqBI90Wr6Tu8YOw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fNOZcpDpBdSZE7EM-PDUY1b9pKMr9g0JGLZ6jWqGXoRNhhx51L9g30EXYSjeAgUk318","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tjyfNdjMo-dqXyy3tFbd3PsaVebLzLzKg82T9QyGVSszzX7FiL5iEPcdkhaTrJXa"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X95Ev9OTyqKHb_slpLVR3YpLQVl0RgCPuWpKcz11dX26xOW-Uf-tUA942e9v4VftiRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4phE3toovKZ8sT9cCXhrNIRiALW_ISt9v0KGDJZnbTe13IGszcC1tazqFFEsPK4dyo9A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kc16FViVEbFA0amkFGvtd45jL0JKGxAXGobUfcQ4CkzB-nWPywKGwxzhTDjWwvNHtwQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Eawz4fyhFrdac4al7Xib_QZ--SdyMK8NfUuy7LsGPQ2TyRJEUthE2CfFhlt2NZapgw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VkxsddOuNm_-Y4T2Sp5A-ORN6xiofF-sMjMr-Qs2dDhZGZRwGu9WT3m_OrjUDJJ7lNI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sWP9g6xo1wqdN60PZ1Srln4iOQNthNONYm7ipzsh4BltAJQprXKVTXCCP0MUy9xhBBE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BLY3m61uD_B0_m6rI61JEtBOcSzbvXVMrXu531AwXJzNwDCtzJFj8tdQuffAW0EVA0C1""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,,1714097405000,"8.60.1","Do more with PayPal, with more power packed into a single app. Shop the world with ease, send payments near and far, and much more.

Lo peor es que contactas al área de soporte y cuando logras por fin que te atienda una persona, por más que le expliques que ya actualizaste todo, te repiten los mismos pasos que les indicaste. Terminan diciendo que es problema del dispositivo, cuando en los foros de Samsung todos los que tenemos Galaxy A55 5G reportan el mismo problema. Actualización. ¡Por fin funciona! Lástima que nunca reconocieron su problema. En fin, por lo menos ya es usable. | i love it | Love it | love it | content is great, player on the other hand leaves a lot be desired. one particular bug is the fact that playback stops the instant wifi drops for even a half second (so auto reconnect cant save you). It even breaks when you are playing pre downloaded content. recommendations are meh. dark theme is nice | Coolness | fast loading | Worst app ever, downloads will not load, and trying to stream in bad cell reception causes videos to distort. | just love it. | my app!! | Terrible for streaming live NHL. I have no issues with any other streaming app. | Flawless | awesome | Sound is delayed. The sound is not always delayed, but I feel like I have to fix it probably at least once for every show/movie I watch. To fix it, I just rewind the show for about 20 seconds and it syncs the sound. I've tried restarting the app, rebooting the tv, reinstalling the app. None fixes it. It is a small nuisance and it is only max that has this issue. All the other streaming apps (Netflix, Disney, Hulu, Amazon) work fine and never have the sound delay issue. So I know it is not my tv. | I Just Love it!! Thank You | MAX always has new movies and better selections then other streaming networks!! | I like it | why do I have to download to find fees | . ...t'...... % & ? ? the!?/,and . ... . ..t. ..... . . .. \ . . ,~? ? scotty 😂. Scotty . . . . \ | thank u | be cool if you had less chick flicks and more sifi | App works, but be aware that the ads are at absolute MAX volume and the shows are extremely quiet. Would be great if they adjusted this to avoid the jump scare every time an ad pops up. | I really like this app and I really like watching TV and movies | Best | great | Love Max!!! | Muito bom! Ta ficando quase melhor q Netflix | How do you make all this money from great content, but reinvest none of it into making your app better? | I love the choices and quality of this app!! Bravo!! | Decent app, but the rotating selection is annoying. Since the majority of movies and shows in my list were removed, there is no reason to keep my subscription. | Most of the app is pretty good. Max needs a rating system of some kind. The majority of the recommendations are just terrible, I'm lucky to find one item I like in the recommended section. also, can we please remove ""Velma"" from everything. That is the worst show. It's worse than mashing together family guy, robot chicken and Jerry Springer. It is without a doubt the worst show I have ever watched and it is a complete and entire insult to the scoody doo legacy. Everyone should feel ashamed of it | has the best movies | absolutely love it | Has some of the best shows you can't find elsewhere. | Don't like commercials in my movies | very good shows | When the movie is over it still stays in the ""Continue Watching"" please fix it. Suggestion: Put a button where we can manage what we want in our Continue Watching | Great movies and shows but app crashes constantly and when it does work it takes forever to load up and currently trying to watch something I downloaded but close to the end of the movie it keeps popping up error message and will not play any further And the link it has won't load at all | great | Great | So far so good!! | Max SUCKS. Literally the most glitchy streaming service I have ever had to deal with in my life. I miss when it was HBO max. Yall need to get it together. | This was a 5* app for as long as I've used it, which goes back to when it was HBO MAX and HBO before that. For whatever reason, nothing will play after this last update. I'm far from the only one. Look at the reviews. You click a title. the screen rotates to landscape and goes black. the go back, pause, and go forward icons pop up. Then it closes the video and goes back to the menu. It literally doesn't function. Stellar app before this last update. Should've done some more testing. | This is a disappointing app considering users are paying a subscription. It takes minutes to load the home screen, even on different networks. Downloading videos to watch offline is a chore. Reconsidering max subscription with how poor this application is. | Great | Been a long time coming for me but i finally made it over to Max and man am I glad that i did. So much great content! Love the cooking shows with Amy! Cant wait for Selena in May, and omgggg KENDRA!!!!!!! GIRL.. IVE BEEN WONDERING WHERE SHES BEEN HIDING, and im so proud!!! :) Thanks HBO MAX! | Must be quickly but its it's okay | great so far | great content | All the movies and cartoons are only in English and i pay for the ultimate | The content is good but the app is so bad, the baddest app for watch TV... | E7 House of the Dragon is too dark even with max brightness that I can't see clearly. I found it's ""intensional"" from the show, it would be helpful to have a configuration in the app to increase brightness in these occasions. | Doesn't work as advertised way too much lagging. Then they wonder why free streams exist lol | Very great app however please add an edit brightness screen button watching NBA games and the screen being very dull. There is no solution to this. | Iam done with subscription my bank will handle this matter.. | great app | Wont work on my tablet | fantastic! | love love love | Very good app It has a lot of variety and for like 20 bucks a month to also get sports game added it is very worth it | ridiculous how much your charging for ads hope people start boycotting your service | You have incredible TV shows, movies and documentaries, it was a success to combine everything DC, HBO, HBO MAX, DISCOVERY and CARTOON NETWORK | Super dope 10 out of 10 recommend | awesome sauce | alsome app and stream service | Gay bs front and center, and you can't control reccomendations. Barely any good movies. Not worth a penny | Site says you can stream 2 devices. I kept getting a message saying I was streaming on too many devices at once......I was only streaming on one device when I tried my 2nd and got an error | slow at times but overall good | Trash it won't lit me sign in | great | outstanding app. great shows | Does not work on my smartphone | good content but the app is slow to switch between options on my Roku | Great DC movie selection | Have to play a show to register for the continue queue. Then, completely exit the app to go back in. Because it zooms in randomly on a picture, thinking my tv is bigger than it is, I guess. Works fine on my phone though. | I loved the Winchesters, Torchwood, Charmed, Dr. Who and etc. | better the the big red Net | love this app has alit of movies that everyone likes try it out | Since I installed this app (a month ago) and then stupidly paid for an annual plan, I have yet to get it to work for more than an evening. The next evening I have to uninstall and reinstall it to be able to watch a show. When the app is working, it's pretty much the same blase app that most of the streaming services buy a license for. No features other than the basics, very plain vanilla. As far as customer support, it seems to be nothing but 'bots. Corporate mediocrity comes to mind. | I started with HBO Max because there were two shows I wanted to see. I didn't realize I would be paying for the privilege of watching ads, then more ads, then more ads. The longer you watch a series, the more ads are fed to you. The app itself generally worked okay for me, though it did have some glitches. | they have all my favorite TV shows | App works great 99.9%. Sometimes, after selecting series to play, the sound loops without a screen image, just back out and open again. It will work fine. | Live sports is Phenomenal 😎 | Pretty lame when you can't block a series and continue to do yt algorithms. """"Nice."""" | Que tipo de serviço nao proporciona a opção de linguagem no download. Estava melhor quando não era essa frescura de max. | why do not have speed control?, and why some things dont have English CC? Please I need it 😂🤣 | Ads play twice as loud as content. They're obnoxious and repetitive. Cast does not work correctly. Navigation is clunky. Not a good app. | Relatively good app. The added sports are cool but they blur out and clear up for most of the game. Please fix so we can watch enjoyably. | Can't stream on mobile device | --UPDATE: this app constantly crashes and stops working for extended periods of time after clearing cache and restarting or a re-download.-- Content and video/audio quality is better than on HBO Max so far. New app features like PiP is a great additional (what took so long?). Having trouble right now with the Continue Watching, it somehow keeps putting me back to episodes already watched. | one of the best apps out there. organized, easy to search, not glitchy or laggy. nothing like that dumpster fire that Paramount+ is. Love MAX | The app no longer works. I updated it and restarted my device, and it still doesn't work. It just sits there trying to load. | One of the best apps ever has great movies and has new relieves. | has some good shows I want to watch, but the skip forward and backward buttons literally don't do anything | rj is i8 it dead yes ioo Ted oo yet ig y v tug l 6th if | BEST STEAMING APP ON MOBILE!!!!!!!! | I don't know what was done to the app but know all it has are splash thumbnails that link to collections that link to nothing. Update: it was a simple fix. I just cleared the cache. | Newbies, oldies, and DC...

Changing stuff that worked well for the worse, whilst the app deteriorates. The new ""like"" is awful, and the app is so slow. I'll be in WiFi and it'll take the app almost a minute to work out it shouldn't be in offline mode. And why does it take so long to load up SAVED TO DEVICE playlists? They are saved?? | I am so disappointed everytime I will be downloading all the songs I have downloaded before what is wrong with you guys How many times will I download songs that I have downloaded before You guys wasted my subscription and my data every am so disappointed 😞😞😞😞 You guys are not trying at all I won't advise anybody to use this app it's so bad | Higher founders to entertainer fan syok.Seronok giler you. | Too much ads too much everytime I play a song Now I am shifting to wynk . Spotify wasted app if it goes like this. | It was the best app until all of a sudden when l play music, the app is the one that plays the song from my playlist can someone fix this becoz I don't download l use this app for listening to songs so plz help me and fix it | It's very good | Verry good | Its kinda cool since i had a premium & everything worked well | Nice | This app is very usefull | Too much add also congress ka chattu har song ke baad same ad | I like | Waste after update | Very very very bad review about this app, 2-3 adds after every song, new update is also very frustrating, we cannot skip song, go backward to listen music again, it always stuck on shuffle mode and much more problems..... | And zAAA | Very good. So much variety...excellent app | Good | Wish I could rate it in negative. | Nice 👍🏻 | Since Spotify has made it compulsory to buy premium..my experiences have been worsening each day...the songs that it recommends do not actually match with my liking...This is the reason I have switched over for other platforms in order to listen to good music | Kyu paisa Paisa karti he sale Spotify valo paise par hi Marti ahe | Payment sucks , it keeps saying unable to connect. | SUPER SONG'S WITH PRODUCT SUPER I AM EXPERIENCE TO SPOTIFY | They got rid of car mode. Bad times🥹🥹🥹 | No ads | Literally the best music stream app .. people complain about occasional adds..but on other platforms you can't even listen even a song without adds and the premium justify it's price(although I do think ₹100 will be killer price) but I am pretty much satisfied with it | I dislike the recommendations just play what i want | So good app | It doesnt allow u to do anything without premium, it gives continuos reminders until u buy premium... it used to be a really good app for listening.. | fix the forwarding problem immediately. why we can't forward the song to a specific time, or a specific line ? | Use to be the best music platform but it has become worst with each update | Gutter trash app. Offline listening with ""premium"" is simply not a thing. my ""liked songs"" playlist is the only thing that loads offline. Garbage | Worst aap seen in my life | Worst music app ever.. 😠😠 | PLEASE STOP ADDING RANDOM THINGS TO MY PLAYLISTS 😭🙏 THEY'RE MEANT TO FIT A THEME AND THE THINGS YOU ADD ON THERE RUIN IT 😭💀 | Wcwgen Excellent | The reason why I gave this app 1 star is because they just want more money. I have been using spotify for 5 months and saw drastic changes. It stopped letting us download, increased ads, stopped fixing the shuffling and MOREOVER STOPPED LETTING US CHOSE OR LISTEN TO NEW SONGS. I HATE THIS FEATURE AND THE REASON WHY I AM QUITING BECAUSE I HAD ENOUGH. THE COMPANY JUST WANT MONEY. PREVIOUSLY I USED TO RECOMMEND SPOTIFY TO ALL BUT NOW I HATE IT THE MOST. Hope that developers fix this issue ASAP. | Tolong sortir lagu2nya dong...lagu2 vulgar tolong di remove.... | Very nice | Horrible, so many bugs, crashes, can't play song, can't skip, can't play a specific part of the song and many many more.. | It works. | This app was just amazing but now it is the worst | Ok | Amazing app! It lets me play any song I want without an issue. It's a little tricky making an account or signing in, but overall I love Spotify! Recommended for everyone. | Nice | Very badeeeee app | I can't play music anymore. Every album got no songs | for some reason my entire playlist is completely gone. ouch. cant even make a new one. | The number one's best player's music | This Spotify is not like before. Can't listen songs can't download it also, for everything money are used i don't like it like before. | The update!!!! It's horrible . It's just becoming worse day by day | can't login with correct password and email | Tum log na ye music app band kr do kabhi bhi kux bhi chalu kr dete ho aur test to itna ganda ki puchho mt ise axa test to gully ke bachcho ka hota hai unse gane sun lo chahe☹️😣😠 | Good | WORST. APP. EVER. I can empathize with the app's strategy of promoting and nudging users towards purchasing premium memberships by airing ads after every alternate song earlier. But recent changes seem to have significantly limited basic functions. Users are unable to play specific songs, skip tracks,or even access favorite tunes. I believe they should charge upfront when downloading the app instead of implementing these limitations later. | lopit, sayang pera | Brilliant | Worst app No playback No play in order Then what is use of Spotify ?? But one thing Spotify is best for listening ads 😂. Then what is purpose of Spotify as music player ?? I am switching to another music player app. Uninstall Spotify | 👍 | Just MADE IF RESTRICTIONS , does not deserve one star also 😑😑 | Amazing | Good for sleeping and studying | such a gpod app to listen music in!! i don't regret downloading this <3 | I love it | Hello. I've just discovered your a.i playlist feature. Such a great idea, thanks. I still am hoping for lossless quality audio though. | I'm installing and Uninstalling it. | It's noice | could you add A-Z Artist on the menu? Edit: Great songs and love the ease of the app. Glitch on the TV tho. | Spotify is the best medicine for stress and tension | Very bad | Good | I lIKED ITS PAYMENT METHOD | Recent update is the WORST👎👎👎. | Very bad app Too many ads | Can't believe you got rid of Spotify Lite!!! 😤 Was so much better than this one, whicu shouldn't be the case. Making a playlist on this is soooo slow and I quit it cause it's so annoying | Awesome app 💗 | Bhai yeh na premium maang rha hai plzz Spotify walo premium bnd kro | Worst most problematic app on my phone. Always crashes. Constantly says its offline even with a good connection, and now i cant play any audio out of my phone speakers. If youre considering spending your hard earned money on this service i suggest you look elsewhere. Shame on you spotify. Ive had these issues accross multiple devices.

If you and your love one's don't have it. Download it now. Hubby on road a lot and I don't need to phone him to see where he is and he can see I am fine. Thanks for making stress less. | Was working fine now hardly loads locations or even shows anything. | great | Perfect app for relationships where u don't have anything to hide | It really accurate and user friendly! My favorite app!! | If you want to know where one of your loved ones are it's much more accurate than Google maps | So helpful works well really like | It's helpful | Why does it not have real time location all the time? Or is my settings wrong?...it only shows history in parts and there is always a time gap. | STOP BLOCKING THE MAP! I know my battery saver is on, I'm the one that turned it on. I don't need the entire screen covered to tell me that. The small text next to my icon is enough of a reminder! | I can track my bf | It's helpful | Good app. Could do better with the accuracy | Great quality | Its so on point it tracks exactly where somebody's at and it's just that's good I love this app big thanks to all the people who created it 😁😁😁😁 | Great | It is good to see where my loved ones are makes me share more moments | Helps me keep up with my kids! | Great app. This is peace of mind where your family is concerned! | I love this app. I feel so much safer knowing people in my group know where I am, and I know where they are, too. I am too poor for the premium version, so I can't give a review for that one, but I imagine it's great, too. | Not to impressed really as a platinum member ot sure if find another company or not | Love the real time features of knowing where they are, and have been. | Can't believe anybody ever went anywhere without this app. Install people, it's totally worth it. | Awesome | Me likey | Safety | 👍 | You might want to think about a different app they're add bar sucks | Dismemberment | Brilliant app 👏 I love it | Make me track my fam so I'm. And they safe Daddy | Very very accurate!!* | Won't populate any information more often than not. Samsung S22. | Battery hog. It makes 1 trip into 5 different trips or more depending on how many red lights you get stopped by. Google family link is a better free tracker without having to turn off power save features as this app requires you to do just to be able to use it , which causes faster battery draining. And stop asking the same question over and over again. I will not exclude from battery optimisations so asking 1 time should be enough. This app is very intrusive | Useful for large families. However, having your advertisement being the only thing you can see at the top of my list is really annoying. I get it though, pay for the service and the ads will go away. OR, just uninstall the app. No one likes a bully. And pay or deal with the apps is what it is, bullying. | Works really good. Seems to make my Google maps not work correctly. If you could fix that it would be great. | Lately, the app hasn't been updated even when I checked for one. It showed my disabled child was one place and they were not. Causing me to miss time from work. It has happened more than once. Up until the last several months, it was fabulous. I don't know what happened. | So now there's ads, and it takes longer to update location. I'm going to look for something else. I strongly dislike app. It's not getting any better. | Love this app | Love this app❤😎 | Help know where my people are with out bothering them | Love it 🌹🙏♥️ super nice and accurate 👌 every family need it. 💞 the minutes you up loaded you will love it. Still So Helpful. | Awesome app! Very good details on location and speed. | This app sucks. It once worked okay, but now it barely shows you where the individual has been or what time properly; it also shows individuals at locations they aren't actually at. It halfway works but mostly just drains your battery and sends you unwanted communications. Don't get the paid version it is not worth it. | Used to be good, now it doesn't update in real time. I continously press the refresh button at times and nothing. It sucks now | Been using it for years, but now the pop up ads cover half the map so you can't use it. Another great app ruined by ads covering content. | Great always active never laggy information always clear. | Great | Love this to.keep track of my parents ❤️ ♥️ | Writing CS via app just sends an email asking why u need help when u already sent it. App is buggy, wildly inaccurate, notifications inaccurate & late. TINY USELESS map- almost 1/2 of map area is an ad to upgrade & icons for upsells. Why pay when u can't see/use it? put your clutter on another page! you have to zoom 5x to see details for 1 person, each is time consuming re-tapping, scrolling, zooming. Location drifts wildly every 20 seconds. It's NOT our phones. QUIT BLOWING USERS OFF & FIX IT! | Covers map area now. Can't pull down tab to expose map like before. | Very helpful. | I can not send it up with dog. | It is nice but always it is saying to go to settings | It's not that accurate but it is in the ballpark it helps to know where people are | Love the app | This app, at one time, was amazing. Not so much anymore. It requires ""precise location"" permission, among many others. Which, in turn, drains your battery. The popup ads take up the majority of the screen so you can only see a tiny portion of the map. Which makes it virtually useless. At the end of the day, I feel like they are forcing your hand to pay for a subscription. That I highly doubt will be any better. I will be searching for a new app if these problems aren't fixed immediately. | I had problem sign in because could'nt get code via sms, after live chatting with Moises and live call with Jen, problem solved, thankyou very much for your very kind of help.. This is the best app. for families to stay connected.. | Really worth it | Does what it says... I can stalk the whole family right from my phone. | This app has been great at making sure family and friends are safe! | Great app for security with family and friends | I normally love this app, bit with the new update, it doesn't allow me to hide the bottom of the screen anymore, so it's a very tiny map. Can you enable hiding the bottom info again? | Since update my daughter's location doesn't update nor can i refresh | MY EXPERIENCE WITH LIFE 360 IS WONDERFUL A VERY GOOD GPS TO TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO AT VERY GOOD | A little testimony ... My son was in an accident while using uber ... I was able to get the emergency services to his exact location with this app. | Love being able to know that my single daughter who lives 2 hours away is safe. I know when she goes places and that she's arrived with no mishaps, plus if she needs a rescue, I know where she is to get to her in a timely manner. Makes me able to sleep again. | Great app to keep up with my loved ones. | Good apps | It has been stuck for one month on a location that I am no longer at | Awesome family safty | Thanks goodness this wasn't around when I was a teen. Thankfully it is now when I have teens! Life 360 keeps them on their toes. Love it! | Operates well, but live data could be better. | It's good, but make some features free to all. | It's great! | Good | We love this app and it still is reliable | Nice | The best ever | Very bad 😞😞😞 | It's decent although locations aren't accurate and you have to pay 15 a month for most of the features | This works perfectly on my gf and the notifications we spam for fun sometimes but it's really accurate and you don't need vip to get the most important part of the app | Can't even log in. The app says it will send a code and just times out. Tried - unsuccessfully, to get support but the only thing I get is an email(occasionally, 2 emails out of a half dozen attempts) which tells me to do the same steps I've tried. It tells me I'm locked out for 24 hours...I've waited a week for it to tell me this again after 1 attempt to log in. This all began after it had me verify my phone number after 2 years of using the app, every time I logged in. | Ads made map view area smaller, making it harder to see locations | It doesn't show you properly where you are It says IM at the pharmacy but IM at home. Also, I'm still waiting for my tiles The wallet one. And the key one. Please sort out your. Satellite system. And sort the app out because it's not telling people where I am and it's causing trouble People think IM lying because it's telling them. IM at somewhere else. And I've been waiting for my tolls for 5 months. And still hasn't received it. | Not working like it should for me | iloveit | Love it. Don't have to call where someone is. But you just have to check Life 360. Gives you peace of mind. | Is an amazing app to check on your family. I love it. | This is the most amazing app.. it can save or locate someone especially children.. thank you I enjoy it.. | I is good for kids and family's | It's such a cool app! we can always be reassured where our family is! We love this app! | Sheet 360 | We have used it for years and like the functionally. | If you like Ads this is the app for you , ads take up half the screen , why?????? | Very good apps.. help me to know my famili location. Tq | It's very good, helps me communicate with my mom | I don't get the code when I input my phone number to register on the app for the first time | It constantly yells at me about turning off battery optimization and battery saver for no reason and it offers no way to tell it to stop doing this I WILL NOT TURN THEM OFF. I DONT CARE IF IT WONT TRACK ME WITH THEM ON. YOU DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND ME TO TURN THEM ON I AM WELL AWARE OF WHAT THEY DO I SHOULDNT NEED TO CLOSE OUT OF SEVERAL POPUPS THEN GET SUDDENLY REDIRECTED OUT OF THE APP AGAINST MY WILL TO MAKE YOU SHUT UP FOR 5 SECONDS I AM NOT TURNING THEM OFF | Great app! Only one big problem. Very inefficient use of screen space. When you click a user to see their location, the map is only using half the screen and you cannot collapse the information below. You should definitely be able to see more map. It's very annoying and enough for me to knock two stars off the rating.","{""1"":73803,""2"":29802,""3"":60704,""4"":246831,""5"":1526950}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $199.99 per item","9","9","VARY","Life360","Life360","feedback@life360.com","http://www.life360.com","1900 S.

You always find something to watch | Phenomenal! | Great price and selection | The ad plan blocks a large amount of movies. You have to buy the premium 15.50$ to unlock. This has gotten insane, ive had netflix since it started. Netflix you have gone too far, i hope more people realise if they stop paying youll stop raising. | They change the terms and conditions without informing the users, they say your subscription allows to have 4 devices but they force you to use the same wifi for those devices, such a useless company and they steal from their customers | Will not let me use the app claiming that my device is not part of the Netflix Household for my account, which is untrue as I am in said household. | Common link | 14 days to use my account?!?! I can't travel???!!! | Have the movies that I like and other programs that are very good for me. | Msayii | Nice app | My family is apart of a household yet netflix refuses to play videos and constantly says that the TV isn't apart of the same household madness | Horrible app should not be available 😒🖕🏾 | I hate the services. | Good | Goodbye netflix | I luv it | Really good but some stuff cant change to English on some which is super annoying so I might switch to youtube | whats the point of being able to use screens when the people i want to share live in a different household. | Very cool movies 2 see | It is very good but they don't always have the latest film | Service is straight garbage, the whole Netflix household thing is absolutely horrible, butchered quality for the sake of greed and disappointing sequels | What's with the bugs?! I was trying to watch TV shows and Netflix freezes after a single episode, making me restart five times to get to the next episode. | Will be more good if you add the refresh option. Because whenever you see a webseries or a movie than it takes a lot of time to get refreshed on recently watched. | Payment issue always 😡😡😡","{""1"":1977239,""2"":349078,""3"":583057,""4"":1375239,""5"":10216458}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Netflix, Inc.","Netflix,+Inc.","playstore@netflix.com","http://www.netflix.com","100 Winchester Circle

"Easy Homescreen","Simplify your device. Simplify your life.

Do you ever feel overwhelmed with your phone? Or struggle to find apps you need quickly?

Easy Homescreen is a launcher that replaces the Android interface and simplifies your phone with easy menus, larger text and buttons, and minimal aesthetic.

Life is complicated enough without a phone that overstimulates. Make your smartphone an oasis of tranquility and elegant design. 

Easy to Read
The home screen uses larger fonts and simplified controls. Large text makes it easy to see what you’re looking for, and with large buttons you won’t have to worry about trying to click on tiny icons to get where you need.

Simple Menu
The Easy Homescreen app consists of a simple screen containing the options you choose, including apps, shortcuts, text conversations, contacts and more. It also uses text labels rather than icons, making navigation more simple than ever.

Minimal
Our phones can serve as a huge source of distraction and overwhelm if we let them. Organize your apps simply, and keep your mind clear to focus on things in life that are most important to you.

Beautiful Aesthetic
Display all of your apps in an aesthetically pleasing way so your phone can bring you all the vibes. Life is too short to have mismatched icons scattered all over your phone causing chaos and stress.

Utility Features
Includes commonly used features you can access quickly from your homescreen. Maximizes ease of use and productivity.

- Weather
Easily access the current weather and future forecasts.  Click on the weather widget at the top of your homescreen to view more detailed weather forecasts.","<b>Simplify your device.

I can walk to the store, but I have health problems I'm worried if I'd make it now I haven't been out of my house for almost 5 months and not used to walking that far especially with bags. I'm on food stamps and they should work something out for the delivery/service fees. I had to buy more than I wanted and tip less than I would have if I had money and didn't need cat food. | easy! | thumbs-up | it's an app that doesn't f#$_kin work unless you yell at it , call it a C U N T besides that the app is very easy too use. love the service btw ☺️. | I ordered an expensive meal(Exactly $70.00 with the tip I gave driver) The driver mixed up my order with someone else's. I requested a refund, and they denied it. So I'm here stuck with a much smaller meal and no refund for the much more expensive meal. Why was the refund denied? They gave no feedback but a ""Sorry and we understand if you are disappointed"" What's even the point of ordering if a small mixup causes money loss. | it's 7/11. you know what to expect. convenient mediocrity and that's fine by me | My address has always had issues on their gps map, and they just dont fix it/no way to report it. Their drivers have started stealing my food and the support basically doesn't care and keep trying to give me ""credits"" instead of a real refund. My concerns aren't important to them at all, hence 1 star. | easy to use | awesome | doordash is by far the best food delivery app | won't give refund when orders aren't dropped off | Can't connect as of late in the app. When I want to put a new address it just doesn't appear. Please help you guys are the best one | convenient.. | Tha bomb! | Easy and convenient! | Can't load addresses retry in 5 seconds; great first impressions. I'm hungry. Next app. | Drivers forget items all the time. no full refund when they do forget. | Awesome! Thank you 😊 | An Obscene way to Waste Time, Money, and, Effort. Half my orders are wrong or stolen from... | It's groovy | good for late notes | Customer service is below a 1 star rating. How situations are handled based on previous incidents isn't realistic nor customer friendly. | I love Door Dash, they have great customer service, and will fix issues with any orders . I'm happy about Door Dash, the best service app for ordering food. 💯👍 | First time using this app. Lots of issues getting it set up. Wouldn't accept google pay. Took 25 minutes to process an order for 1 pizza. | My original review is below I came back to edit mine. It has changed. They're just scamming and price gouging. Don't waste your money. So many restaurants have their own apps now and the deals are better honestly... My order was made incorrectly and for no reason it was not fixed. ""I get lots of good deals and whenever there is a mistake with my order (like if it doesn't arrive or if its made incorrectly) which happens rarely, Doordash always makes it right for me. Love using them"" | Used it one time, didn't get the order, didn't get a refund. Absolute waste of time. Should have just walked the 6 miles to the store in the rain. At least then I'd have queso and probably friends to share it with. Door dash made me not have friends. Screw you Colleen I hope you enjoy the queso. | They suck! My order went to the wrong address, the driver couldn't speak English, so we couldn't talk to each other!! The app changes your address sometimes. It was no fault of mine. They refused to give me a refund nevertheless. I'm done with Door dash. Grub Hub, Postmates, Menufy, Uber Eats are reliable. I can also communicate with their drivers!! The nerve of these people. Did I mention that I'm DIABETIC?!?! | App doesn't work at all | pretty good for the most part. there has been quite a few times though that the restaurant has messed up the order and either gotten the order completely wrong, or they forgot to include items that were paid for. I think there needs to be a check out system where the Door dash driver checks the order with the restaurant in person, to make sure everything is correct and then it is confirmed on the app that the order is correct. this would be an AMAZING addition to the whole process! | Late cold food every time. I live in a major metropolitan area, and their estimates are always way sooner than when it actually comes. And they don't do anything to compensate you for your loss. This company went public and turned into a scam. They charge more than the store. Updated 2024 This app is the worst | good app | Doordash is trying to kill wage laws. They've hidden the tips and set them obscenely low to try to make drivers' lives worse because new wage laws are cutting into their profits. Even though they pass the cost of the laws onto the users already. | super easy great app to get food when you don't want to leave your house | I love doordash and have been using it for YEARS! ONLY CON is the support is horrible, there has been times where the dasher has gotten me the wrong food and they refuse to refund me & instead offer me a $5 credit for an actual $50 loss. | under pay their driver and they over charge for delivery | Love this! | Horrible past 4 experiences in a row. Never gets an order correct and has order problems/delivery. Awful customer service! | I think the Dashers are great. They do very well. The problem I have is that to delete your account on this app is like jumping through hurls. Most apps have the option to delete an account right from the options. On this app you need to go to your settings then go to frequently asked questions, then talk with a support representative to ask them to delete your account for you which is absolutely ridiculous. I also do not like that you cannot remove a credit card without needing add another. | Deleting this app after delivering for it for a month. Absolute garbage does not function on the driver side. Crashes on every delivery quit wasting your money on this platform. They're just a merch store | good | greatest thing ever | I rarely use it but when I do it comes in clutch | Door Dash as an idea is dope. In theory..sssuuucks!!! The fact that someone can just drive off with your purchased meal isn't okay. App great, idea awesome, in practice...no thanks. Never again. | it's great but there's a small fee regardless of anything and everything it makes you think is free so keep that in mind. sorta a level of trickery to that if you ask me. | When you don't receive an item or the merchant gives the dasher the wrong order they never refund your money ... it will say refund issued but never received any refund when a driver failed to deliver full order or eaten my family food.. the last driver stole my burritos only delivered churros so this company is garbage I tipped yet I got screwed over to many times that I can not even fathom keeping a account with them . Do not install nor use them there drivers are thieves | SLAVEDRIVERS | Great | 🤷🍜😋 | I downloaded I clicked Facebook here I typed my email address and password. It won't WORK ☹️ I don't mind using this. I rarely order out because it's to expensive for my order plus paying door dash. Which is MONTHLY ‼️ like I said before I rarely order I requested to stop taking money out of my account monthly. I cannot afford it Alright going to check menus | fast and easy | awesome app. when you don't have a car. | Order food and didn't get all my food refused to refund me or reorder | i love it | Lets me order from Guero!! | minimal menu options...like extra burger no meal plan for kids, no lettuce wrap options for regular burger | discount code worked and easy to use | the ""arriving on time"" ploy is what gets me. Of course they'll arrive on time if you keep adjusting it. | ASAP should be an option not schedule a time for later | Best pizza ever! | Drivers like to do what they want with little to no repercussions. They also like to steal orders or not even get the right order entirely | Doordash is a rip off, they double the price of everything and only pay there employees 3 dollars plus the tip. $47 bucks for 2 hamburgers is ridiculous, even for delivery. | Doo doo | Sometimes they get your order right. | good | im big back | I constantly get orders that are wrong or poor quality and then Doordash doesn't compensate even though I'm paying additional money for every item through them. They have service fees, delivery fees, tip, extra costs for food and still can't guarantee decent food. The only positive side to this is now ill save money by not paying 2x or more for food I can get myself. | works great for me. I love doordash | really good 👍 | I've never had a problem. they're generally on time or early | 30% mark up from stores menu...then they tax and DEMAND tip on the higher price. HAHAHAH DELETE | Each time i order something, the driver always takes it and replaces it with the opposite brand or something else | great when u are moving and forgot something on your last day at old address | fees are a bit high | Drivers steal your drink. | Ooh ya, Harder!~ Harder!~ | 😎 | love the service and the food is still hot when I receive it. | awesome | always room for improvement | fast!!!! | Don't know yet still waiting. | Great delivery and very nice driver. | Saved the day! | Driver claims it was delivered, no one knows where. Sent a picture of it sitting on a desk, but not one where I work. Customer service was rude and unwilling to help. Guess that's what I get for being hungry while at work. | Better than GrubHub. | someone ate out of the salad they had the nerve to stick it in the corner out side my door and balled up the receipt and didn't knock on the door what is I didn't get a chance to try it I am not eating after whoever delivered this food and I really like this store food but afraid to order now I want a refund where can I send you pictures | you guys just nickle and dime everyone | With the new login system, it's impossible to actually login - it just keeps punting back to the login screen. | awesome services available anytime | Nice and convenient | The app is mostly functional and the UI is intuitive, but every time I manually adjust my pin when setting my location, it reverts to the same place after saving my changes. My complex is split across the north and south side of my street, and the ping just defaults to the center of the street no matter how accurately I place it. This is often confusing to my Dasher and it seems I can't do anything to fix it. | y'all be quick | fee are way to high. 6$ for a delivery charge another 5$ just for using the service and then your tip is also based off those fees instead of just the actual meal. it's theft in my opinion. | food | really good service for delivery | Garbage. Not only is it over priced, but the service is screwing over the people that deliver the food. I know it's convenient but changing it starts by you not using it! | pretty easy to use a little more expenses in in the city but worth it if you can't drive | 4/5 I'd say.....which is pretty good so far, let's see if the marketing department is gonna try to CRAM encyclopedias worth of nonsense down my throat or not. | Always a go-to delivery service.

It is good to online shopping. | So great and its delivery is very fast 😁 So helpful | 💪 | Awesome 💯 | Worst experience held in custom | Nice | They cancel so many of my orders! I am expecting stuff to arrive and it never does! So what if its refunded? Its still disapointing! Some stuff great, some Not. | Good shopping experience, pretty good on notification control, if you don't like to be disturbed, fast loading on images etc.. | Really had only good experiences so far. Absolutely brilliant***** | Great job Ali express | Great! | Great. | Good service | It used to be a nice app to buy cheap gadgets with a good customer policy. Now, it is more expensive and they take no responsibility for delivering your purchases. If you order and it never arrives bad for you. They will never reimburse you even if you use the guaranteed delivered service. Buy at your own risk. | Very gd . Refunds quick. Tracking well Coins for discounts | Alliexpress has been so amazing app ever since wish left our region | Thanx aliexpress the way you doing business | comparable to shopee and lazada👍👍👍 | Use it every day | Awesome place to shop | I am from Pakistan. Very useful online store from where you can buy almost anything. The delivery time is considerably reduced from average 25 days to 10-12 days from China to Pakistan. | Loved it.. | Brilliant app very easy to use. Better than Amazon | Got this app and buy more product with good quality | Amazing | Great experience so far. I am thankful that I got a refund as well on my incorrect order placement. Good price range products. | Good | Very cool I love the concept of the 3 for 99 cents | ❤️❤️ | This app is very help full to us as a sri lankan... Excellent App love you Aliexpress every day..... | Delivery before time | App too slow now and never got my money back on an item that never arrived as customer service said there wasn't enough evidence and took the shops side I think they were out of stock so never sent it | It's friendly and easy to use | Good App | Best place for shopping Good price Delivery before expected date | Sometimes the prices seem unreal, but it's all true. Tons of information for each item. Returns allowed, free shipping on 1000s of items. | Some items didn't delivered to Pakistan | Ali express is doing a great job | Perfect | Great deals 👌 | Pretty intuitive and easy to use | الحرامي الأعظم، الترجيع عندهم عبارة عن سرقة للأموال بشكل صريح. | For every recommendation. Everything respected. | Constantly undeletes messages. It is extremely concerning that the keep returning deleted messages shows a huge lack of concern for security. Every item you follow instantly gets spam from stores. The app itself constantly spams the user to turn on notifications and now whatsapp notifications . They have no concern for users and pretty much spam non stop ads annotifications settings. All store messages should be off by default.. If a user says no to notifications, don't keep spamming. | consistent and decent | Best app in the world | GOOD SOUNDS JUST RIGHT | Yret | Pretty fast | Many Americans are apprehensive about purchasing from foreign suppliers but so far my experience has been fair and pleasant. Any issues and Ali administrators are quick to step in and assist, everyone is polite the whole way through and I appreciate that I get products the next specific criteria. 2 months now and I'm very happy with the service and the suppliers I've dealt with. I reccomend, If your feeling apprehensive just try it out shipping is quicker than you think👌 | I spend almost whole day with you AliExpress US Thank you | Always Great! | Very good | Absolutely one of the worst experiences I have ever experienced in my life with regard to online shopping! worst.and ,I am 30 years it professional.unbelieveable. make sure the order total including your selves tax is correct. | Old AliExpress is best new AliExpress 😢 I buy 100$ more but no coupon | Happiness | Product is great, I brought pieces to my bike, they even shared a video on how to install it to my motorcycle helmet. All products are at a reasonable price, and shipped quickly. | It's very useful online business | Great | Great place for cheap junk | Satisfied😅 | Excellent | I thought it would take two months to get the item but it arrived in ten days. I got everything I chose. Thanks for the excellent service | Fake comments app doesn't work. I'm removing item from my cart doesn't remove. Adding something like jewlry not working. Welcome deal means 2$ or less but only one item free shipping on your first order but nothing is removing or adding. I don't wanna waste my money. | NO PROCESSING TIME (has disappeared)... NO SIZE/MODEL PERSONALISATION... eg input body measurements for chosing clothing, (like Shein & Temu does).... i DO NOT want to see iWatch or iPhone suggestions in search results when im looking for Fitbit or OPPO)... The App & website are super frustrating to use | Good | Amazing service | I love this app. I recommend this to everyone on the planet download this app right now!

Other than that good. | Trustworthy app | Great timeless app, it just depends on tour countries relations with China for a more timely delivery, and is morally better than Wish or Teemu. | In app games crashed a few times. App is a bit buggy. | Los pedidos no llegan y pierdes las disputas y no te reembolsan nada. | 4 out of my last 5 orders never arrived... I never had issues until recently. Sad, I enjoyed shopping here. Ali will send you a refund, but I rather have what I ordered. Sellers hold your money until delivery timers run out. Ali needs to screen their sellers better to prevent these scammers from ruining their company | Love my Tunisian crochet hooks | They are cheating about the items when registring the app. Each item with 1.5$ I didnt recieve it and the company responsible for delivery not bring it to my adress and the drivers not responding to calls and masseges | Best site. This site is best alternative to Amazon. Items sold on this site can't be found at amazon. | Hasta el día de hoy. Excelente. Gracias 🫂 | Great | I have received everything I have ordered. Therefore I am very grateful for this app. 5 🌟 and possibly more. | CHINESE SCAMMER!!! I ordered some items, but they never come. I reported this issue, but CS never took care of this.

The new layout NEEDS to be improved. For example - now it takes much more time to reach the active members tab in servers, at the cost of the faster replies. Here's one idea - you can add a toggle allowing people to opt out of the swipe for reply and instead swiping right to show member lists. Also - the limits of saturation and contrast adjustment need to be expanded. | Erm what the sigma🗣🗣 | I don't understand the reason of adding authentication codes to discord... Many users can't log it to their account because they lost their authentication codes and discord does nothing about it their support website wasn't useful it was a waste of time... All I can say do better discord cause this thing can not run | This app is great for chatting, my only prob is when I chat with one person and press the send button it takes a long time to send, so could you please fix that thank you. | how can a company big as Discord try such dramatic overhaul with an experimental new ui and receive thousands to millions of negative bad reviews on their app and not do the common decency of taking the L, and converting back to their already working, and already great ui. they probably have some type of financial reason why they are continuing to stick with this bad ui. please discord it is not worth the money to lose thousands of your dedicated users for such blatantly bad ui. fix this please. | Worst app evernno service never verify code if it's right nothing worst app ever I see | Annoying White bar on the top, very hard to navigate, wont preview videos, not enough space on the text bar. Revert the UI update. | Nothing you send me via text works I can't Verify my phone number to talk to people it's annoying please fix this:/ | It can be buggy at times, but it's still a really great app to get together with friends. | Nice app for chat | The new UI for mobile is genuinely awful, please either revert this or give us a way to change back to the old layout. | New bugs have arisen! (Samsung S24 Ultra with gesture nav mode enabled) Images will now clip off screen and won't show full content. When opened, they will MOVE TO THE TOP RIGHT CORNER and be EVEN MORE OBSTRUCTED. Images will refuse to show properly until rotated to widescreen ALSO, the compose message field likes to HIDE ITSELF BEHIND MY NAVIGATION HANDLE, causing me to open AI screen search instead of selecting the box, which forces me to select it with my S Pen, AND hides behind my keyboard! | Idk I was bored | App is absolutely terrible now, how could you ruin a perfectly good app so badly? | The interface is ruined , can't send a single image properly or view a video properly... There waste a single reason for the need for these changes | Yes yes yes yes ☺️😁😁 | Cool. | Very nice app but daily owo is very less should be 10000 | it's great | Very good | Will not confirm email, tried several times, no confirmation sent. Uninstalling without even getting to log on. What a terrible first impression! | Very buggy a lot of the time. Messages not loading in time, the emoji picker simply completely breaking the app to name a few. Hoping for a fix soon but it's been weeks now | Jit crazy | Cool app | Nice | Yoo discord can u remove the resend verification email address thingy its very annoying and i cant even chat bc it always shows that is why i give it a three its still there remove it pls i wna talk with my friens pls pls take it of | Since I gotten a new device, when I went to log in, I wasn't able to get a verify log in notification, I tried re-installing it, and it still didn't work | Discord is awesome for gamers, but TERRIBLE for accessibility. Blind users like me can't decipher captchas, making signing up or recovering accounts a frustrating nightmare. Fix captchas or offer alternative verification methods! #DisabilityFail | The app that lets me do so much | Notifications are totally messed up, click on it to take me to that message and it loads up then takes me to the last channel i was in for the last server i was in instead of the actual message | Best app ever... I talk with my friends easy and when I make YouTube videos I can talk to them and my video can still here them and it's just amazing.. Thank you discord | It is so good app for chat with friend | Good and aswome app_by the way chat me in group name: crasy sever | Discord really needs to pull their stuff together regarding UI changes. Some of these changes are just downright illogical like not being able to swipe to the left for a server member list | I don't like Discord mobile. I almost avoid using it. Personally, I try my best to use desktop. Issues I experience: GIFs, emojis and stickers lag the whole app, server pings dont show up when you're in the DMs tab, but not vice versa, Selecting files is a really bad experience, There is no way to search for public servers (that i have found), just the uselss school function, Last but not least, it is one of the slowest apps i have ever used. At this point, just use desktop. | Buggier than ever. Cant send a single message. | I don't join any server but suddenly in my list showing i am in 2 server's how ? Please slow this problem | To many bugs it stucks | Very good! I give it 5stars | Good app मेरे लिए | Discord is amazing but It keeps sending me a verification email for no reason. | I've been hacked and can't get my account back | Big men always try to find and theyre always smelly | Discord call doesn't sound after connecting and next member doesn't even get sound. Please fix this problem as soon as possible. My group is on Discord. I play Ludo. So please solve my Discord problem. | I Give you some 1 star because I can't even verify my account when I login my account it keeps saying that I need to verify my account so I verify my account but when it's done to verify my account it still keep saying that I need to verify my account so please fix this error problem | Fire the ui designer team | Genuinely the new updates have been getting worse and worse. as much as I use this app because of the contacts I have on here, it's practically a shame anytime I open it and see that the screen somehow keeps getting smaller. I'm sorry but whoever's idea it is to keep making the UI this bad needs to be let off the team /lh | Garbage | I have been having to manually mark each channel as read, because it won't do it itself | One of the best social media..! I really like it..!👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 | Op op op op op op op op op | It NEVER updates server emojis. If I ever want to see anything new, even things I've personally uploaded myself on desktop to my own server, I need to completely uninstall the app and reinstall it. Tried restarting phone, updating the app, force-stopping and restarting, the ONLY way is to entirely uninstall. Piece of 💩 app. | they made it way worse than I thought was possible. the new UI update makes the app not worth downloading | Bruv. Why the heck do i need to verify my email to change it. What if people lost there email. How the heck they are gonna change their email. | Great application | Good | It's a great app but when you use it for android, the app lags alot! I have been using discord for more then 5 years now, its a fantastic app but the recent updates are not optimised for android. Please fix it. Thankyou | my life is ruined because of this app, they didn't informe you that in case you open your camera is the front that will appear, so because of that i'm having so many problems my life now, i'm suffering from it, + this app isn't safe there is a lot of illegal and dangerous activity going on there, beware | I don't know why but when i stream the audio is not working on some apps | great for active online communities, even though it tends to bury information quickly in chats. plus it keeps asking you to rate the damn app | I love this app I really recommend it and if you are not on netboom, you are really missing out!!! | Best social community plateform ever ✌️ | ❤️ | I don't understand these negative reviews, of course the UI is weird, it's on the phone. If you're that perturbed then buy a computer :/ Great app for long distance friendships and even local friends, great for file sharing too. Voice calls are incredibly clear as well. | Ok | it good | Good | Awful. Are there any human beings working for this company? A company bot will disable your account without telling you why, then a customer-service bot will wait a month to contact you, despite knowing that Discord deletes all information relevant to your problem within two weeks. | You're latest update means my phone no longer recognises where the bottom of your app is and I can't tap the home buttons any more (for messages, the main discord home button etc), super frustrating. | Auto updated. I wish i could give it less than one star GOD the dev reply is so annoying, The new layout is impossible for me (who has been using the old layout since 2018) to navigate, I genuinely do not understand how they thought it would be better. I had to download the previous builds of discord to revert the change because thats how bad it was. | Update 04/26/24: the UI still sucks. | The newest update has left everything borderline unusable. Text is weirdly sized, emoticons automatically change to emojis, you can no longer favorite emotes. The app won't loaf properly if you try to enter via notification. Emotes are no longer highlighted in a sentence, making them hard to read. The most egregious thing is the inability to leave reactions under texts now, but all in all the whole UI is completely trashed from how it used to be. | This new redesign really sucks, makes me ignore DMs more | All calls cut out for me | New update is filled with bugs and lot of errors kindly fix. | Its a very good app to chat with ur friends and its basically like WhatsApp but trendy lol | These updates aren't trash. There's still a bunch of bugs, but I've gotten used to the layout. Don't go back to the way it was before please. But I'd like it if you'd fix the bugs I'm having problems with. | Couldn't sign in again | App is useless since the update. Have to close and force stop every time just so I can read messages posted in my group. | toe | It alway bugs and crashes | I owe this platform a lot. I have made some true friends from here. And I can't thank Discord enough. Thank you. P.S the app needs some minor bug fixes. I hope the team solves it. 💙 | Lags on opening media any other page other than texting | The fixed something that wasn't broken. Horrible app now | I miss the amoled feature | its filled with bugs | Wow | Besides being a very laggy and slow experience. This app sometimes has a bug where a message will be sent twice. Update: Reinstalling made the app more responsive. Thank you Discord. | I can't login it won't work I've tried 12 times | Discworld logs you out of your account so much you have to remake a new account every time Discord is just horrible Discord Discord is horrible it logs you out of your account you have to make a whole new account | Go back to the old layout and I'll download it again | nice one | Nice one | Who keeps asking them to make the least functional changes to the UI?

It is completely inconsistent and a horrible user interface. Whoever hired someone for this should feel bad, and whoever did this should feel worse.

In addition to this, there is no feedback other than posting something here. | Reddit has been a great experience to use, I'm enjoying using it thank you 😊 | Most racist and useless app. Crashes so frequently that it wastes a lot of time. | Good way to get connected with the community on so many different topics or experiences. Most posts are well moderated. | It works fine but there's too many ads and suggested posts. I miss the old apps, the times change | Excellent customer | Worst app ever | Super | App works great but can you add the option to have 2 or more post's and not just card and classic. | The app bans you for no reason at all, it's policy are useless and so it's review ban methods. Really deleting this app. Worst service ever! | Nice | Worst app it has so many bugs , And now suddenly my reddit age is 54 years old I can't even chat with anyone personally or on group chats . It's a shame on you people for having so many bugs on this big platform!

Your updates are horrible. Things that worked months ago don't work anymore. Keep the download button at the top. Most videos do not load, do away with the swipe that takes you to a totally different page. Come on, don't you pay attention to the complaints | Got banned and I tried to find out why. Wasn't given an answer about what I did. Been nothing but helpful and nice the people who put in arts and sharing tech stuff. I'm pretty sure I didn't say anything offensive. I tried to figure this out on my own and realized after some research about Reddit's/Mods questionable history. But now I understand.

EVERYTHING. | Notifications never work | Unique but good perspectives | Nice app | Reddit is home to many different communities. Something you like? There are definitely many subreddits with people in the same community! Plus you can even ask for advice or help. Overall a really nice app. | A DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA ENTIRELY | A lot of good interesting information. Especially like the YNAB subreddit. | Loved this app! | There's community for everyone no matter who you are. | So much less convenient than RiF. Hard to tell what's an add and what's a post. Text posts are hard to see. Overall very cluttered | Nice app | Idk what it is with Reddit, but it kinda sucks. I love sharing posts to my communities, but I hate scrolling my feed. It SUCKS. I have joined particular subreddits for a reason, I don't need three posts in a row from ones I am not a part of because ""You visited a similar community."" No. Go away, I don't wanna see them. And there's no option to turn that off. | Dean girl Sam girl little sister big girl | With every update, they rework good, working features into unusable messes. | Good books | Awesome | I cannot sign up this app | Its reddit | It's not all bad but the feed keeps randomly refreshing and I lose my place and it takes too long to load the recents page so whenever I try to show someone a post I recently upvoted I have to go recent -> upvoted and it will show me posts I've upvoted for 2 seconds before refreshing and overriding it with the default recent viewed posts. It's getting more and more annoying to use overall | I use Reddit significantly less since being forced to use their native app. EDIT: I had a long description about my complaints when I first was forced to switch. I haven't been on in some time and now I find I can no longer sort my Home feed by New (or any other way of my choice). Reddit has moved to the use of an algorithm which chooses which posts I see, as opposed to letting me choose my own. Like Facebook, I'm over it. | New update feels like a step backwards. | ""Unable to upload photo."" 🤦‍♂️ | Great | Horrible developers toxic community. | Every niche under the sun is out there for you to deep dive and meet other like minded people to share in a country mmin interest. I was slow to adopt to Reddit as I never explored bulletin boards or message boards even back when they were popular. I just casually grew into exploring Reddit and now I devote at least 10-15 minutes a day exploring topics that have an active community with common interests. | It's pretty good, although they seem to be censoring people's comments/ opinions. I'll try to update this review in a few weeks after I've experienced more on this Reddit app. | I've actually discontinued it a while because of excessive contact, but used it to research. | Good Luck | Very nice social groups | The willing to share honestly on this app is why I keep it | Good app to use just improve the video section when it scrolled it get lagged | Can't figure how to get labels in community discussions next to my username | I love reading the forms that just blow one's mind in a matter of s 5min read! | Why would I ever wish for videos to loop forever, while I read comments, is beyond me? Who thought of this? | Love the content | Freezes and crashes often, tons of the same repeating ads imitating posts. Reddit is Fun was much better. The Home feature shovels 1-3 day old posts into your main feed. | Needs a ton of work. You can't delete messages. Now after the update the messages you ignore are still there and still says you have unread messages. This app needs a ton of work. If you are a it person please inquire if they are hiring because they need help obviously. 🤣 | It's relevant and useful to my everyday life. | I am 78 years old and I have learned so much from the people on reddit. Thank you | I just want to browse the site on my browser but it keeps trying to make me install this app... | Interesting, informative, and sometimes very funny items are posted. App is easy to use. Great communities for discussion. | Excellent and informative | Resourceful | Suspended my account even though u updated the password | Magic | Great app I've gotten so much help from the people there | Awful app. Reddit killed all great clients and years of work of devs for us to use this. Wow just wow | #ANSWERS !!! to Anything & EVERYTHING I have a Question about ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ HAS NOT Failed Me Yet ... .... & Most Likely WON'T 😎 ""Reddit ... You are My Best Friend"" ‼️ & Thank You Benjie Isenhour Esquire | Brilliant app | Jengoogle | Great!! I need to find the the platform for longer vids | Good lots of information | i love it | So far I have not found anything wrong with it, may be the initial feeling as I've only used it really for a month despite having the account for over a year, but I love it, great people, haven't run into any toxicity yet, overall great app of the genre it falls under. | Buggy and unintuitive | Inferior ui. I love swiping pictures and randomly, for no reason at all, swiping into the Popular tab. | Cancerous community, mods and admins. They will permanently ban you for non existent offenses, for disagreeing with them and for other unrelated reasons. Sometimes even without any reason. Power tripping weirdos. | Can't view comments on posts with videos anymore because the video auto-opens and swiping has to many functions to fix it. You have to swipe left to go through multiple photos, but swiping left also switches tabs, with no way to designate which you're trying to do. | Great app! | Doesn't even open links that force you to use the app | Just a huge disappointment after using a third party app. It's like they don't want me to use Reddit, which is my gain since reddit is full of garbage. Added a star for time gained not being on Reddit! Thanks Reddit! | Bad user interface, terrible video player, constant crashes. Fix it, you're a multi million dollar company ffs. | Way worse now than in the past. | I use Reddit mostly for gaming related inquiries. Never disappoints when trying to track down if somebody's having the same problem. | Full of fun and nasty people, good and bad. However good app | This App destryoed my life..........5 stars","{""1"":1181978,""2"":91662,""3"":92433,""4"":331097,""5"":1381480}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.99 - $199.99 per item","8.0","8.0","VARY","reddit Inc.","reddit+Inc.","androidsupport@reddit.com","https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download","548 Market St # 16093

I highly doubt a .jpg is meant to be incompatible. | nice app | very useful application | You just turned a good and simple application into a useless thing... What's the point of this upgrade when no one likes it | After the new update, it became the worst app. Now I can't even do a photo grid fast. I am still struggling to figure out how. I used to be able to select a number of my photos and it generates a photo grid then allows me choose which grid to use. It's horrible now. You need to hire a UX team | the new app sucks. was easier to create transparent designs with the older version. | superb easy to enhance our creativity | Great app‼️❣️🧸🎈🎉 | Great app | happy | Not at all impressive | The updated app has lots of potential. I have a personal account and a new educational account but I can't access files that I have created in my personal that I use for educational purposes. It's a huge pain to share and it doesn't work most of the time. Please make it possible for files to show up on both accounts that use the same email. | I love Adobe! But this new update, I can't use duotone to change the colors of my letter imaging. | surprisingly easy to figure out. works. really good on the go with your creative Cloud apps. It's really great to like crop and manage assets at a distance. | so dang nice | I wish I hadn't updated to the new version. Then interface is incredibly unfriendly and in order to download I need to upgrade my account? Also, most of my previous work was lost when I imported them to the new version. I will not be using this anymore, very disappointed in this garbage update. Unusable and obviously a cash grab | not even able to login, not sure what is happening because error message is not shown | This app is great for my art editing needs | Taking very high time to generate image. | App is full of bugs!!! The old version was fast and simple. This update is terrible. Works very slow, when you are saving the project it stucks at 90%. Please take in consideration. | i like | good | It was good but they made it harder to just place an image on a image and some images I can't add | Die ganzen neuen AI Werkzeuge sind schrecklich. | excellent | normal | super easy to customize logos!! | so impressive application | 8கீர்த்தி890அஸ்டிஎப்கக்களாக்வுன் | it was nice app all graphic designer | resize should be given free to choose | show wonderful app | Good app | The best features seems to be removed and the app is Revamped like Canva | It's waiting of time | Funny and useful😀 | The new changes suck. They took away all the intuitive parts to create social media posts. Not a fan. The Ai they use is not accurate and a waste of effort. It may have lots of potential but not today. This was not market ready. Big fail. Will be dropping my subscription. So I had a person reach out from Adobe, wanting to know more. I wrote a full description. Haven't heard anything since. Not a peep. Guess they don't care, just LOOK like they do. Gotcha. Don't rely on Photoshop or Adobe. | best appl | awesome apps and valuable features available | wow nice app use super | tried 59 times but I'm not able to download a simple text animated video.. it says preparing and then screen vanishes and need to open the app again. full of bugs!! | 😌🤩🤩😌☺️🤐🥰🤐🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩🥰➕➕™️🛐®️✖️✖️✖️◽🈹❌🈲💢🆎🆎🚭🚫🚭🗨️🔻🚳🙃🏘️🏫🌸🍍🍳? | ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ | good 👍 | nice 🙂 | 😍 | nice | Nice easy to access.multi functions build thanks. | best | good | Just got WORSE with the Upgrade. ADOBE couldn't had been more ignorant here. - All previous Files LOST - CLUTTER served on the name of Upgrade - Remove BG went even Worse - Remove Object - Immature Development - It's a COLLAGE that shrinks to a 2.5 inch screen capacity from 7 inches once you edit and image - How immature was that . - Upgrade - Why should one pay for something available for half the cost on other APPS ? - Not Going Back to Adobe anymore. | nice | osm | My business | Well-taylored program even for my old device. Plenty of in-app features and image search features through Adobe Stock. Opens various file types. Program tends to crash when Wi-Fi is interrupted not does it want to load fonts you've used. Easier than Photoshop CS suite on desktop but powerful tool to have on the go. | can't download file in PDF format. | I love it | Improve some leg problem.I cannot type properly, it is automatically come another text. | No words.GOD bless all families. Please do not give up on your children, your siblings, and your friends'children on your neighbors'children, on anyone'children, it takes a village to raise a child, please allow The Savior of the world the universe the earth the planet to guide you through as parent, as guardian and more... . GOD Almighty loves you always, remember. Please try to help them as much you can okay. Try to make a difference positive from your past and to their futures.#WÏBlÏDaSam | Warning! New update is terrible. It says all my screenshots are not compatible. I deleted the cache and uninstalled and I'm having the same issue like the rest of the reviews. I'll have to get another app. I'm sad I have a yearly subscription until October this is horrible | super 😍 | Good design | good 👍🏻 | good | I have been using for years. Best free editor ever | Whenever I type or delete, the words will start to repeat by themselves over and over like if I was copying and pasting them 30+ times. | I used this alot on the fly as a person that's been using Adobe since it was first introduced to me in 1997. After the last update I couldn't recover previous designs, remove backgrounds or edit and add designs. I hope it goes back to the way it was. But probably won't. Uninstalled and starting over. All files lost. | it's great for editing | thnku | Have this app installed on multiple devices & loved it prior to the most recent update. The new version is almost impossible to use. I loved the simplicity of the old interface & program. Now it's just unusable. Bring back the old interface. This version is about ready to get uninstalled & my Creative Cloud account cancelled. | I hated the previous version, and find the new app much more user friendly! There's definitely a learning curve, it looked more complicated at first, but once I got my bearings, I loved it. Particularly love how you can just try out several pictures without constantly going back to the search tool and retyping what you're looking for. HOWEVER CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T GET A JUSTIFY TEXT OPTION ? Sorry for screaming, but it's just SO basic that the absence of it is beyond me. | awesome app new user friendly | I am only a beginner, starting my own business, thanks Adobe, I am learning a lot, love this app! | Time west this apk | Keeps loading till infinity | very good | I'm downloading now if soutable I will increase stars and rewrite well comment | Quick and Awesome! | many futures available | 🥰 | Very Slow response and not performing well | Good | Bad | very good | great for so many good reasons it's almost like capcut | good app so far | Worked great before you changed everything. | cool and useful tool just trying it out | WORST APP 😡😤 IT IS NOT SIGNING PLEASE FIND THE PROBLEM | good | AI feature not very good | so easy to use | good | usefull app | What is this new update??? Worst ever in the whole history of updates. I am really tempting to search alternatives despite I'm paying for subscription. Horrible. Nothing is uploading, sizes are all effed up. Nothing is compatible. Zero stars really...

Literally three drivers cancelled right now. And I'm pissed, not gonna use this app. | Good | My first trip ever using Uber was in Kolkata. I had to pay by cash because the app wouldn't let me use any other method. The charge was 750 rupees, and I paid 800 rupees in cash. The driver was happy. Later I received notifications that the cash payment ""failed"" and I am supposed to pay 750. For two days I tried to resolve this. The ""help"" on the app and the web site is no help at all. At this point I have no hope that this will ever be resolved except by never using Uber again. | I would request you to provide proper customer service. Yesterday I was in devli, first you people made me wait half an hour because each driver was cancelling their rides, another was one in greater kailash where the same situation happened, driver is taking 25-30 minutes to reach to a customer, as a customer I cannot wait for too long, I had to cancel the ride, please improve your service try not to make customer wait for long period. | Professional driver and friendly with customers | Good service | Very convenient | Great | First ride was great! Here's to many more great rides!!! | Nice app. Good service. | Brilliant price | Good | Quick trip, car arrived on time, clean car | Excellent | Overall, it's okay. My Uber driver Eric, was no good. He couldn't find the property then charged me extra to cancel. No Uber. No good. I'll use your service when it works better again. Also, I'm not paying for a drivers fault. I took screen shots of the matter. An addition to this complaint, the drivers need to go for communication lessons. 2 better the service. Thanks. 3 star is a bit much... I know. | Good service | Great experience | Best service | Just bad it rifue | Driver nai cancel Kiya ride phir v mai q pay Karu wo payment v nhi karunga ab uninstall v karunga aap | Accurate | 😁 love it so convenient | map is very weak | Worst app........drivers pretend to come to your place then they don't pick up calls so that we cancel and then we have to pay cancellation fee.....very pathetic behaviour | Not happy with the new update. The UI is confusing. 1 star | Fast, reliable | Good services | Love them always on time for important meetings | Brandon was awesome | Not fast serives | Nice app go for uber 👍 | Today, I uninstalled this app because I booked my cab after seeing the fare according to my budget but when I reached the location my fare was doubled. This is definitely wrong so now I am stop using this app and will look for the alternatives. | Awesome | Nice | Great first use | Good drive | Your driver has not come to the location yesterday he said to me I'm so far I'm not coming. I said to him okay I'm waiting for you but he cancelled my ride from his side. I didn't cancel the ride from my side. So why should I pay. And that driver behaved very rudely with me. He shouted at me last night. I'm so faid up with the app. This is the worst service ever. I didn't expect it. 👎 | On time and safe travel | Cancled on 3 times in a row and then uber said id have to pay more despite already booking tbe trip waste of time terrible service | I canceled because the driver was trying to change my destination and get me to book him outside of the Uber app. Despite that I payed the driver in cash the entirety of the trip for his time. Then I got charged for canceling that trip. When I messaged Uber about this they said that couldn't do anything, even though now with time, I see that the driver was clearly fishy. | excellent | Often, during busy hours, the wait time is too long, and drivers ask for extra money.. moreover, they cancel on us even without prior commitments. Team uber should look into this matter | 😍😍😍😍 | Good | Good | In start it was good, but going on the drivers were not allocated. I have to wait more than 15min , and today I booked, cancelled because the driver was not allocated, I rebooked many times. At start it was good but not now , please do something, please make sure the driver should should be allocated within 5 minutes. And once I reached to my destination the money given to the driver it's changed . After the updating the app the prices has been increased . | Excellent | Amazing!!! | Dooky. App is poopy drivers are mixed. Better than a taxi though cause they charge up front. Taxi.... 1 star. | Nice | Love you | Bad company and bad behave don't install this aap | This app is very usefull and good service. I like this app | Best quality service | Super | Sérieux problème de sécurité Uber Ile de France. Le chauffeur ne s'est pas présenté. Quand j'ai enfin pu l'avoir au téléphone, il a hurlé, m'a gravement insulté et menacé de mort en disant qu'il est parti me chercher pour m'en....er . J'ai contacté le 112. Côté UBER rien est fait, au point que 3€ suite à l'annulation par chauffeur n'ont pas été remboursés! Je signale ce chauffeur au moins ici - BILAL TOYOTA Prius, incident a eu lieu à Epinay-sur-Seine. A fuir, ce n'est plus comme avant! | Amazing, thank you! | Recently they employed a drug addict drivers, at Egypt we have alot of legal cases some of them at court right now, because what their drunk drivers did to the customers, Uber cancelled their hot line number so you can't reach them if you're in serious safety incident, Uber became worse more and more 👎🏻 , cancelling customer support number shows how much you respect and valued your customers.. | On 26 April, 2024 we booked a ride from Ocus Medley to Sgt University and the amount was 150 but the driver took 190 . Please resolve this issue. Otherwise this App is really nice. | Nice | Uber is very trustworthy and is always on time | Wouldnt take payment. Stuck loading payment info. | Why can't your drivers already fill up their fuel before taking booking | Excellent driver | There's some confusion for the first-time user, me, but I got around. Especially for the reservation part, I did know I could find it at Activities. | Great | Right on time, got me home when I wanted to be. Luckily my Spanish dialect gets me by. Either way, great ride. | Brian was so awesome! | Love it It's so good very fas | Tatat | My experience with Uber was very good. This is a very good application that helps the passenger to find a ride without any hassle. Thanks Uber ❤️✨ | Decent | Uber has become an unbearable app to use. If you have other options use it. DO NOT use Uber in Istanbul. You are guaranteed to be ripped off as it uses metered taxis inside the app. May as well be a transport app scam. Uber also does not provide any level of support. Purely AI responses. | Great service | 👍 | Hv been booking unsuccessfully for a hour | Oksir good morning | Uber auto driver Satish is a good | Good | I was at Dum Dum Airport and attempted to book an Uber cab to my home. However I mistakenly booked the ride with the wrong pick-up location which was auto selected .Upon realizing my mistake I intended to cancel the ride but due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to do so at that moment. I had planned to pay the cancellation charges later. However later that night, when I opened the Uber app I was shocked to find that I had received some horrifying & defamatory msg from an Uber driver. | All these subcharges from 40 it went to 62 without including tip. | Drivers will pick you up from the grocery store, then dump your groceries on the street because they ""have another ride"". Incredibly disrespectful! Shows zero regard for the riders who may not have any alternative form of transportation. You are being PAID A COMMISSION in exchange for providing a service, don't leave until you have COMPLETED the service. Let me bring the groceries to the stairs, at the very least. | Good | Very bad experience with the driver on day 1 of app installation | Extremely nice person, very helpful | Very good | I order Uber and saw the text that the drive was arrived and I didn't see any car arrived. Then suddenly I got another driver. I saw in my history that I had 2 drivers. I'm still on my vacation and worried that I will get charged twice. The app is still really confusing. | nice work | Worst application for booking cabs my request get cancelled four times. | Great the service was perfec | Very bad | very reasonable prices | Stressed so early in the morning. Thursday we reserved a ride for my friend to the airport. They notified that there's no available driver 10mins or less before agreed time. In their policy, you have to cancel 60mins before so you won't get charged. But they can cancel anytime they want. Luckily there's a cabify nearby. And lucky cabify they got the €15 tip that was prepared for the uber driver. | Perfect as always | Comparing to other applications Uber is little better. But the sad part is the auto driivers won't accept the trips if we don't put tip atleast 50 inr.. when customer cancel the trip it will be charged but most of the drivers cancel the trips without any reason..Uber has to charge cancellation fees to the drivers otherwise they are calling the customer for tip or additional amount if we say no they cancel the trip. After waiting long time driver cancel the trip it is wasting of customer' time.. | Worst app for riding.u have to always pays extra charges.. So much high price than other travel app | Like you uber | Nice & respectful","{""1"":753853,""2"":171070,""3"":278437,""4"":830104,""5"":11522568}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Uber Technologies, Inc.","7908612043055486674","Support@uber.com","http://www.uber.com",,"https://www.uber.com/privacy","7908612043055486674","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AQtSF5Sl18yp3mQ2tcbOrBLekb7cyP3kyg5BB1uUuc55zfcnbkCDLHFTBwZfYiu1aDI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vhkdrph57wnTM02BCRitwjVcpwK_A4uTTBGhtKxthqWxLagJsV_GV51IS0f7ZRCLsQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Du0m1FkazoVXD5WYl_4uGtNZamXvig_XhlPNRMQzp8MD6ul-l_liqpBgzXhsN6908g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oJPK7YgjRTnwnKsK_zmisox_ZhZMX5ulu_-33hLUKkMnpcYAjRu4LR1PXbQiNflbEBo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ruqGWCPYNSnCIh8ab8AXu1NWFujQSlEXlqwpSBOMH6YDKNZiYbPXKMjm6kOME5a88nkM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TKGpxEhiuFNa3nZtcK-IXJ2YfkFgfksrkZqfiWen28quokLWrJT7gL4CWOA1UlsVhxg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a88fVaTfJT8ggrP5JLX3W1h0BbQSvGEORmLTB8N-95_MR7MlBhokfA0XmiwVjhAE_jU8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WzyhX2mJ4qkYdvD2HAOA7i5BAsx8omXGNiPmIdK4LD4EPfc9EQX2AbU8H3xPVC-FpQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/faFopSJNt1olsTWbAUVprsnHH6PxJmvCeV40KIDwaXVsKC60ZMYfsWDCGX5U3TzXo4A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CuACU2QF6THXocpXtTsWlLYTGEuh-13Qjvivw0KGsIPk1gsJiW03D8xsajVbpHFnYxfk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pLJUYkpnFMZlWFct2BUXPZT0ogkubKjt9xchQNxZNcCAxB5i1QBxELIHvCTp9exsu68"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZE74GAcPDfQ712tw5Ff0LhtQzo54G6cGKXinPXDnvwhALhWqYSHPvGSYF_jAk9q1_3Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/l4MtQoAN8Exbrim3HNbr2Q_a9hWtVuB4j9TQI0oCmkIeGw9Mzq-ELXIFK6O2z41brEs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/F6GtK6mcztM6cRfNTHUTYNAzKxlRaHpIbfUxggqtHjBCST3OvNCiAH4ywkggqUJaSZU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n3MqWcuZZAqCrf_HwkaER4egFnHn7OL0VXnhjbfqaM0NaJQbqfjXiRy8bUyL2JRHLAhm"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NfhCvHB-Jfaw2-t3D3hUH3n2cmsYqF0Gj2n8bBp5Uy0eS1E9Qq3KWvhwfkitJxOQYw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wiTySv0NkUHcaXkF-gb3B8rxFsnPjrDyM-OhjxwW6_mp0RJjBObw4_in2IA4ari7dZo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Yyju12XfluXr26sf8yRpfD6lMIROFyqh3SMEBCNvbjaO0r-ZhrkG90Fm0tH5E9FCI0Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iceq1194-nROpSeswevO0ody8wKNGUnW1YjtCkEsiv3DpGYggeA1OKhtX5qudzVJO3Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rAGigqrKZwg84_nALKP7jkwuZ6QGuydFXRrLN9sS-51xIZs-_xr5swRbnwONGISZOR4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LihDUTIyk_nzs4dil38vCPIQexzLfu6Vo57155vwUoTnCP1_UDMvuUPQ6pWlzjfCig"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9I-dzbG-oTv5F7nhAsApOWpCMGeso2XAeXI0hxcii8i1WPRo9XQ1V4SxQ5dSg068HlI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zYZe6hlteSmYatZ4wZJ3PwE_LpkhjYRJPs-nVz6OsFPDGqNtWTjJraXoVEZmFh2WUw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/k0REwgt_itjAYMoIFoV_7AohN9aC45pmOuOArXq4D3KIyM93gABlgnxp96ksJ1oZcA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5Vw6g8G4IazjRceBSD7P2AAFd4459JddyHg7U-DT-ZEwkWD-8E3jcMfuF7ydsSoDql8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8MWslZ1qn0FuBCN-dLu6YCkPyJH85iCvpcn49BXPdTqB1I-ng5O8OzyFmutLbdpY6g""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Oct 28, 2010",1713789908000,"VARY","We update the Uber app as often as possible to help make it faster and more reliable for you.

*Chime SpotMe is an optional, no fee service that requires a single deposit of $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime Checking Account each month. All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on member's Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime's discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won't cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. See Terms and Conditions.

‡Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.

^Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.

¹To be eligible to apply for Credit Builder, you need to have received a qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more to your Checking Account within 365 days of your Credit Builder application. See http://chime.com/applycb for details on qualifying direct deposit.

²Based on a representative study conducted by Experian®, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and October 2020 observed an average FICO® Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score.

Chime received the highest 2021 Net Promoter Score among competitors in the industry according to Qualtrics®.

Thank you, wish me well! | Switch back to chime after using Varo Bank for a few years Chime has way more features than Varo highly recommended using this Bank | I cannot get chime because they say I have three accounts I have never even received a chime card I cannot get my direct deposit sent to chime that's crazybecause they say I have these three accounts | Love my Chime!!! | it's good but needs more work with spot me | Best banking I've had | freakin love this banking app | You guys have closed many accounts without reason causing people to lose money. I get this isn't the best economy but still don't be shasty. I saw a Facebook post of someone who has been trying to get a hold of chime because they closed his account. The comments underneath explained others have had the same thing happen to them. | Happy | great bank | better then others!!! bank CHIME🏅 | Stupid app and bank | I don't received my pat check two days early.

I love Chime. | I'm older & didn't trust this app stuff but my son got me to do it & I LOVE IT !!! | Have used the bank for years, and do love it still.

Noticed 2 people unable to use card att gas station. | no complaints | I like Chime a lot I switched over when my credit union kept getting ""hacked"" and somehow my money kept getting stolen even when I wouldn't use the debit card. But I do not like this new design. I move stuff into savings because it was at the bottom and I couldn't see it at first so it deterred me from spending money because I gave myself a limit in my checking and credit builder account. Now it displays ALL MY MONEY! And I don't feel comfortable logging into the app in front of people/public | An waiting for the 200 you guys promised to enroll | great app | absolutely love chime | Very good | never gotten the card and it's just another card anyways ..... | I fell in love with it | This is a very good App you should Try it | love it, I tell everyone I can about chime | was tasty.

Nevegetting through the mobile app for my current balance and deposits. It's s easy to understand and manage. Transferring funds are easy and fast. Just a great app. Thank you. Respectfully, Abel Rodriguez | best card ever | Love Chime! | love it as a backup account for emergency | It is a great app and easy to understand | ""We are unable to open a chime account for you at this time."" | Chime suddenly closed my account after two weeks. As soon as i got a good-sized deposit, they closed it with no good explanation. And told my rent RENT money would be mailed in a check within 30 days. It's a scam business. To fix it, give me my rent money today. Not in 30 days. I just linked my bank and my debit card. So send it. | Love How Efficient and Constant It Is | Great services! | I love chime!! | I love chime its a lot easy using this app | I love chime its the best bank . | very fast on direct deposit, and has help me raise credit score with credit builder card | I have had chime for about five years and I love chime have always had great experiences with chime | I love chime ive had it for alot of years and its always been great. 🥰🥰 | Absolutely love Chime! | Been using Chime for a long time and it's helped me a lot.

Everyones credit is different, learn how to manage it cause mine has increased since.

Thank You Chime!!! | I love the features that this card has. I get my paycheck 2 days before payday and before anyone else gets paid. Also the boost option if u need it.

It takes up screen room, & my thumb scrolls and lifts it every time, and I hate it. I ask customer service how I can disable it, they say they didn't know what it is.

It's constantly freezing while scrolling. Making this app almost unusable. Whatever you did you did to the last update, please undo it. Please fix this amazon. | Good | This app has gone from bad to worse. Sometimes, it glitches and takes long to load. | Works | First Amazon has gotten really poor in deliveries. Amazon Drivers: Are lazy and wont deliver to my apartment ( only the office ).Then called for refund and couldn't confirm it, so no refund.

You are the richest man in the world come on now. | Amazon's amazing! | The app doesn't give me issues typically but I pay for prime delivery for literally nothing, and is it really so hard for DELIVERY DRIVERS to just knock, or not lean packages against the door so I ha e to knock them over to get them. | The app keeps crashing | Love and hate amazon. Sometimes their next day shipping turns into two days. They should offer a percentage back for not fulfilling what you pay for. | best | Amazon is amazing and it's great to shop they got good discounts | Amazon closed my account. Why...? Because I returned two products. 1) Cycle handlebar grips. Reason... I received a different product, then has been advertised on pictures. 2) Back pack, seller offered 30 days free returns. So I bought 4 different ones, I kept one and returned 3. The next day, I have an email from amazon, We close your account permanently as you constantly request refunds.

But God help you if you need to talk to the useless customer service center that is (1) ridiculously loud because it's packed with people and (2) they don't speak the best English and try to speak too fast. | Good shopping 🛍 | I like so much because is Sopping is so good ok bye ❤️ | simply great! | Amazon is amazing! They have anything you can think of that you would need.And some of the best prices also | Very good service. Highly recommend if you can afford it. Unfortunately I can't. | Unfortunately Amazon is becoming more and more less worth having then it use to be! It used to be cheaper but now the prices are same as in store if not more. Products come broken or damaged about half the time. I until recently ordered my husband's rockstar on Amazon, about 6 cases a month but 95% is the time I have to deal with customer service due to damage and exploded drinks. It happens so much in surprised when there's no damage! They've gone down the toilet and I don't recommend! | Amazon is still the best and least expensive way to find what you need and to have it delivered the next day, definitely 5⭐ s | Had the odd problem with this company wrong stuff sent and I bought a reduced rate of McAfee security but McAfee kept asking me to go premium and I thought I Already was premium and in the end I turned McAfee off would never use McAfee security | LOVE IT!! | The way of the future! | I was lockout from from my account and I have some dollers there please help me out please how do I contact Amazon so I can't inform you guys more about what is happening to me | Hasn't been updated since 2015, crucial settings missing. Even Aliexpress is 1000 times better and it says something about Amazon's quality. | very good | Loading issues! Order page NEVER opens please fix! Are yall ever going to fix this prob??? | Leggy and keeps freezing | I loved 😍 | Love it Love it | love me some Amazon | It'd easy to use. I'm able to find what I'm looking for. The only problem is not being able to look up the history of items purchased. | This app is very good | good | all excellent service 👍 | HATE THE RUFUS FEATURE! I have used this app for years with my only complaint being that it doesn't have a dark mode option. Now that they added the idiotic Rufus feature I can barely stand to use the app. It is constantly popping up and covering what the descriptions im trying to read or pics im trying to see. I have to swipe it down every couple seconds. It's ridiculous. I have a z fold 5 with the latest version of the app and there is no option to disable the Rufus feature. Please remove it! | Epik | Amazon Egypt, the worst branches of Amazon on the world 6 order make and make payment after this ca cancelled from side without any reason , they told me I'm not want to receive, they are a big liers | really good app | Awful customer service in UAE, my order was delayed more than 2 weeks, and after waiting all this time Their manager is saying please cancel the order and they will refund me the amount!!!! However my order from the warehouse in UAE not from outside, I don't recommend anyone waste your time and use this kind of application, especially their management they don't know how to deal with their clients But if the management like that, we shouldn't expect better than that services | Be careful or you'll go broke. | Very thorough!!!!! | Just going to be blunt: James 1:1-8. It is written. | 1. Cant view cart have to close app after a bit. 2. Move Ask Rufus option from lower section of screen when going down finger accidently swips it up. | Very dangerous app. You buy something you don't need🤣🤣🤣 | good service | Double billed | I've noticed recently whenever I order something, the delivery person would sometimes mix up my package with my neighbors. We live across from another and it'll happen every once in a while, nonetheless I still don't know where did my package went. | nice app | Great | Super-duper fast. | Latest update has made this unusable because scrolling a product page locks up the app. The AI on product pages is also extremely useless and an annoying waste of resources and screen space, as well as making it more of a hassle to check reviews and questions/answers. It needs to be optional with a choice to disable it completely. Who needs some irrelevant AI 1st grade book report style explanation of what some basic concept is, just because that word was included in search terms??? | It's 3:15am, and I'm blinded by the white background in Amazon app. After 10 years any fix or we wait another 10 years for dark mode? | App freezes so damn much and constantly having to be forced closed. Huge battery drain too. | Flawless. Usually hard on software but this just works. A model for other apps to copy. | Uninstalled many times. It keeps installing and opening itself.","{""1"":343286,""2"":89190,""3"":124970,""4"":386603,""5"":2814491}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.99 - $149.99 per item","9","9","VARY","Amazon Mobile LLC","Amazon+Mobile+LLC","feedback-amazon-app-android@amazon.com","https://www.amazon.com","AMZN Mobile LLC

Looks like it's been this way for months. Can only be incompetent devs | I am unable to un subscribe my subscription. | legend Service | Super bro this app | Video chalte chalte ruk jati or fir start bhi ni hoti very bad experience | The menu it's not easy and it's not suit for you, but to advertise amazon's preferences. It's not customizable, doesn't remember/memorize very well where you left the started movies | It sucks youtube way better | I don't have any major issues with it. The ads are a but annoying but apart from that it's OK for me at the moment | Nice | I have paid for a subscription, yet many of the listed movies are currently unavailable or require additional payment to watch. This is very disappointing. | I like it | It's crashing so many times in a day I can't watch a video after i purchased the prime membership i regret within a day I also have Netflix subscription too but I didn't face any problem in Netflix but your app is performing more than worst experience | Comercial targeting way off , same with movie selections. | 🙌 | Bakwasss | Love this app😍😍😍 | Words can't express my love and joy for what this app provides me with daily. Whether I'm at home or utilizing my mobile capabilities! I feel like LL Cool J felt about his radio!! 😂😂💯💯 | The video playback is continuously stuttering on any of my devices so I cannot recommend it | This app can NEVER remember where I am on the series. if I put in background while playing it will terminate eventually, and next time I open it it will autoplay THE WRONG EPISODE AND TIME. This is incredibly annoying, selection of content is mediocre, originals are pretty bad. Nothing that Twitter or my friends are talking about is ever on Amazon so after I finish some of the old series that are on here I'll definitely leave. Upd: removed another star cause the subs don't load anymore | So far app is great | The fact we pay to access a service with this many ads is ridiculous. Proves amazon's greed. | Cheap and good. Better UHD support than other streaming apps. | Can find what I look for | Pathetic interface. It feels like technology from 10 years ago. If you play forward / backward 10s then the screen will be stuck for at least 5s. There's no option to dilter movies basis genres or release years. No brightness lr volume controls while playing video. Do anything while playing video and it switches to portrait mode. Plus to show movie caution/ rating the top left screen keeps lit in blue haze for far too long (simple text can't be enough?).. To top it off: the application is slow! | Super | Using prime lite and only accessing it on one device. Still it says “Your current subscription doesn't support watching on more devices.” I'm watching on only one device. Very frustrating. | Ye 7 | Useless app, the contents are very poor as compared to Netflix. It is not worth it for yearly subscription. I always wait for new contents. The user interface dashboard is very poor, you can't find something easily. I will not recommend this app. Better to move on Netflix | Now it has become the worst OTT platform. Even after taking an yearly subscription, it asks for payment for 99% of the good movies. | When I subscribed for Prime it was ad free why has Amazon added ads? Already most of the good movies aren't available with prime and now they are making it like youtube by adding ads. Even youtube allows to skip a ad after 4 seconds but Prime doesn't. It is killing the experience. | They train us to get slowly used to ads then increase it over time. Result is same shi..y experience as regular TV. | Excellent | Solid app... | Easy peasy. | Amazing | There is a delay of 5 seconds in pausing the video or moving forward 10 seconds. The display turns off completely and only voice comes. | Ads should not be allowed in a paid for service | Good | Amazing | Picture will devolve into green static. Captions will not work on Chromecast. | Always enjoyed amazon prime. Do not watch it as much because ads have been introduced into viewing, whole point of leaving terrestrial TV and the beauty of these viewing packages was no adverts. Only so far my precious money can stretch b4 I give up totally. Still I do love the amazon app. If it ain't broke don't fix it, | You added ads | The UI loads slowly. Over half of what I watch just doesn't show up in the 'continue watching' section so I have to find the show again and guess where I left off. The ads are MUCH louder than any of the content they interrupt. And the autoplay doesn't work most of the time. | Crashes too often | I don't really like it. When I am looking for something specific to watch, is not here or if is here we have to pay or rent. Also, I am paying subscription and now we have to watch ads, no good at all. | Over all is good app, the movie is good and have so many you can watch it all day | Worst customer care ....unable to subscribe this channel ...worst app ever I used | Nice app No quality issues | Very nice choices..I just wanted a more responsive player. | Best movie experience ever ,but even though we have prime,some movies are unavailable and should be rented that is the slight issue | Their should be more tween/teen movies! | You had one job - get my purchase of Kungfu Panda and sync it with the Amazon Fire stick within a reasonable time for the kid to watch, and you failed to do that. App, you suck. | Good | I like it but i hope they will add more anime | Wonderful. Thank you people! | It good but it always takes forever to load and never lets me stay without glitching. | Nice | Overall annoying, you pay for prime and still have to deal with ads all the time. I'm watching a 25 minute per episode show and there's minute long ads every 5-10 minutes. Its also rarely ready to play the correct episode of my show and I have to go and find which episode I'm on. I love Amazon and I use it regularly but I feel like prime video could use some improvements, especially on the phone app. | Watch party removed only reason I paid for a subscription | Really enjoying the options and format of prime. | inconsistent aggravating | Great originals, especially movies. But as what's most TV apps, there are only one to two seasons on a very good plot line for a story, episode , e.g | Love this app | I dono it only plays audio for my favourite shows Now more and more audio only | Worst service ever. Pay for subscription, then gets restricted behind another pay wall. Pay for that again, and then there's pairs of ads that are 1m each (*2) every 10 minutes of the movie. Good luck. | Casting sucks | Love it! | Good | Worth It!!!!!!! | Brightness is set on low and I have no way of changing it | Good app good selection. | Really poor video playing service in comparison to netflix and d+ poor full screen, weird method to watch videos where yoy have to go to the amazon app.... | Poor controls RW and FF are terrible! 10 sec, wait 5, 10 more..... | ***flix kept on disappointing me , never having the good stuff every time ***flix failed me prime surprised me by having what I was looking for . I have no complaints . The app is a1 no issues . So ehwt now they charge a few bucks to avoid comercial/publicity its worth it . | This app is absolutely amazing the whole family enjoys it | A cable TV in app video streaming form. Way too much content is for rent, or buy (why is this a thing? WHY?), or under specific additional subscriptions, let alone increased costs to go ad free. It's back to channels and packages just under the guise of slightly different names. When I'm paying out the wazoo already to just get access I'd hope for a decent selection to start with - but nope, not for me. The app's UX is also terrible and seriously under funded (especially with Chromecast). | Amazon prime good | All around great experience | It is not possible to control brigtness due to auto brightness on the device messing video quality. And also as web app and this app do not give you 4k quality, a better option would be to use smart tv | Awesome 😎🆒 cool | Liked it ... easy enough | So the ads that I pay not to have come in clear but the show buffers and freezes restart show watch ads that I don't pay to them show freezes again rinse and repeat for 30 minutes | Video is getting skipped. I know ads are important for guys but God test your product | So I pay money for the membership for years and now they want to add an upcharge to remove the adds. The streaming service is not great, it's gritty at best no matter what wifi or device I use. Besides a few prime originals, there's really nothing good on prime. | Love all the classics | Horrible subtitles. Sometimes it desynchronise, sometimes it stop working completely. | CC is off sync constantly. | Burn baby burn | Love Amazon prime bring the best shows | An app which was bad got worse with the ads. A lot of movies don't come with the original audio, which makes no sense. There are movies and series that you have to pay for. So why the hell would I pay for the subscription? | Good | Fallout was awesome | FIX YOUR APP SO I CAN PLAY THRU HDMI CABLE FROM MY PHONE WHEN WIFI IS NOT AVAILABLE!!!! Will not play with phone to tv hdmi cord connection. All other apps and services work but not amazon prime. Why is Amazon blocking this??? Wifi is not available and the cord is the only option. Screen mirror does not work without wifi. | Great and helpful when I have need help witch hasn't been but a few times especially easy to use | Besides the here and there episodes that don't start where you leave off, the freaking commercials with paid subscriptions. I will have to reconsider whether I can keep this service. | I love it | My money credited but app not working properly","{""1"":659097,""2"":205440,""3"":241883,""4"":505195,""5"":2687281}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.05 - $333.00 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Amazon Mobile LLC","Amazon+Mobile+LLC","pv-android-feedback@amazon.com","http://www.primevideo.com","AMZN Mobile LLC

Compared to google it does quite a bit right but i feel the ai overcensors itself and the app is still a bit glitchy sometimes. | Edge is one of the BEST BROWSER. I use either MICROSOFT EDGE or DUCK DUCK GO. That way, the BROWSING TRAFFIC is not so bad. EVERYONE uses Chrome or Mizolla Firefox now a days. So, I bounce between all of the browsers. However, I mainly use Microsoft Edge or DuckDuckGo more. | Sometimes it was my favorite browser sometimes I wasn't sure. I need to make sure I understand all the features. | Good | Keep the very good performance. Thank you. ✌️💖😀 | 27/04/2024. The rendering issue hasn't been fixed. After 3 months, still no feedback about the issue from Microsoft. | Works for me. | Very amazing for browsing and looking news magazine | I'm little disappointed by this app... | So good | Very convenient now that CoPilot is integrated into the browser! | it's pretty great using Bing Dalle-3 Image creator and the A.I. itself. There is definitely room for improvement on user interface perhaps you can ask the A.I. to recreate a new web browser face everyday with Dalle-3? | it works. | It's looking good and nice outlook formate buddy 😎 | Excellent, happy to use on par with my default application. Thanks. | This app is awesome, my go to Android browser | good | password auto fill no longer works | Making the corporate user use a specific browser in the name of security should just be made illegal. | I've had a great experience with Edge. | Very good 👍 | My default browser. I love Copilot! | The reading mode text to speech didn't work. Other wise good app | Amazing 👏 | Ad Block stop working on YouTube | I appreciate your help and support that you are doing for me I promised to pay that standard bank account | A file that I attempted to download months ago failed and keeps showing up in my downloads tab as in progress, even after clicking the X to remove it. It keeps showing back up when I open the downloads tab. Fix it. | The only problem that I have with this browser is ""the opening of the app is just way too long"". Why are you guys showing logo? Remove the logo and loading screen. It's just so frustrating when I need to search important things in hurry. | Very user friendly | Wonderful desktop experience but on Android this proves to be meh! The problem with the ui glitching very often and failure to display anything on screen dispite the website loading successfully questions the developers credibility. Kindly resolve these issues. | Excellent browser! | One of The best browsers | It's ok but need more upgrades and I think it's slower than chrome | Not working. | always good | AI needs serious work | Great application for anything | Password autofill stopped working. On login screen, the saved credentials pops up but tapping it doesn't do any thing | Five stars because they fix bugs fast when I report defect in review | Good | Why the hell does this App KEEP Crashing??! I was initially really impressed TILL it just kept crashing.. nothing seems to solve this! | Phenomenal user experience | when will this godamn browser implement ""open in app"" feature | Don't force me to open a downloaded PDF in the terrible in-browser PDF-reader that barely works as good as a dedicated app for PDFs. Otherwise a great browser but something like this absolutely kills the experience, especially given the prevalence of PDFs in work-related tasks. | Wow excellent | So far so good. Seems smooth. | 👍good | Please link all my account to both my pc and phone thank you | Good browsing app | Great 👍. E monate! | Too good ☺️ | Idk | I like edge. Whoever put the address/search bar on middle of the screen instead of at the top a couple years ago or so, that was a genius move for all our grossly oversized phones. My hands and thumb thank you. I see people reporting the image and videos glitching, I too have been experiencing it on 2 phones for a year or two now. Across a couple versions of Android. To those who have been seeing text on some websites totally disappear, if you're running dark mode, switch to light (review space | Best luncher | happy | What the heck is wrong with edge now. Loads of pages not displaying correctly (bits of page repeatedly drawn over the rest of the page). Been like it for ages too. Chrome works fine on the same pages - how can such a closely related browser be so broken for so long. | Randomly puts apps I didn't turn on like stuff from scratch and other games appear out of nowhere like Roblox and sometimes it puts hub on my screen when I didn't | Very slow and bad. I don't like it. I like my Google Chrome the fast and super | As always great time there, staff are really pleasant t and very helpful, fantastic site. | use saved password can't be use. | Best web browser on earth, every product Microsoft makes is the best even Zune and Cortana and their smart phones | lots of News items a variation of Googles with less adverts | one of the best browsers with lots of features. but I fell lag in this app | Media Background Play not available Please provide Background Play on app | Es bueno, busca las cosas relativamente rápido y haceryado... El caso que es bueno | Super good | Update information... | Wonderful all around!!! | Very slow Internet browsing. | Good app | very useful | better than chrome nowadays | OK | I installed it just to review this and chrome is piece of trash. Go firefox! Now I will immediately uninstall this POS. | works 😃 great | Edge works quite well except for a couple of issues which only arose in a recent update. When trying to add a URL as a short cut to the home screen via ""Add to Phone"" option, it simply takes you to the ""App Info"" screen rather than adding the icon to the phone. Also, it tends to offer to install an App rather than adding to the phone home screen as a shortcut to the URL. Over 3 months later, the issue remains unresolved ☹️ | Haven't use Microsoft on my new PC but will give this a try | Good work you're company is well Successful. | complete bloatware.. just does everything to make you sign in and collect info. | Don't pretend your ""AI"" browser is anything special... TIME FOR ME TO DOXXXXX YOU NOW 😂 | I love Microsoft edge better than any of the other browsers. My only complaint is I have a Galaxy z fold 5, tab grouping works fine when my phone is closed but when I open to the main screen it looks like a standard browser and there is no tab grouping feature. It makes it very difficult to scroll through my countless tabs, I wish there was a tab grouping feature same as when my phone is closed. It would also be nice to have the option to put the address bar and navigation buttons on the bottom. | Good | this is a great app | I have a Windows with the Microsoft 365 it all works together wonderfully. Being protected by Microsoft Drfender makes everything safe and secure. Edge completes this package with safe web browsing, you have a fan. Thank you so much. BC | You guys are the 💣💣💥 | Some versions have worked, but I'm not sure which I should be using... Bing and chatgpt, edge ai browser, copilot, I. Think there's even a couple more, and I'm not sure what the difference is between them. I'm installing copilot pro too, hopefully it can tell me... | good application | Very nice and helpful to me. I love using it Thanks. | great and interesting , thank you for this opportunity , | love EDGE! | The stored passwords are not getting filled automatically | A good app | It's not worth it, 😕 | Try to add Extension on mobile version like kiwi & yendex, mises browser | Edit: Though the original issue has been resolved now unable to use saved passwords. == Started using Edge in 2022 and was a great browser.

I will be discontinuing the use of this app | Awful. Waited for a ride 20 minutes and no hit. Kept telling me to reset my request 👎 Uber is definitely better. | Always on time. Very convenient | Can't even get a ride. Added two forms of payment I frequently use. Right before confirming the ride, it rejects me, saying I must add an additional card. Meanwhile the app tricks you into thinking you're all set by sending you coupons. Tried again 2 weeks later. Couldn't even verify the second card when I tried. Left me stranded again, because I can't test until confirming a purchase! Friend had to call an uber. | It's a great service, but it's so annoying that drivers can cancel right before they pick you, and nothing happens to them. When a person does it, they get charged a fee. I don't know how many times that has happened many times in a row sometimes. Other than that it a good service just need to hold them accountable for that. | awesome driver | Comfortable and enjoyable ride with Jessica. | Obviously changes price to almost double after you check the app, then open it again | Driver's going to wrong address , getting address backwards... Then you are being charged a Counclation fee.. smh | There's no experience, othman never showed up Do not charge my card. I'll call Mastercard as well and cancel payment. Some business you're running. | Just kicked me out with no explanation and I'm unable to sign back in | Driver couldn't find me at an obvious intersection and repeatedly said he didn't speak English well when I told him exactly where I was. I got on a bus instead. Lyft should let you filter drivers who speak your language. | Apps works fine, but almost 100% of the time drivers come several minutes longer than selected and pick up times are almost always 2x as long as Uber. Have come, unfortunately, to only use Lyft as a last resort. | Waited hours for the app to find a driver and nothing. Completely worthless app and company | App not working on Pixel 7 Pro, after setting destination only a blank screen is displayed. I've tried reinstalling with no luck. Unable to use Lyft now. UPDATE: Still unable to use this app on Pixel 7 Pro, Uber gets all of our business. | Call center guy deleted my account with $60 and a $50 gift card. And app isn't even working on my phone all of a sudden | I don't like the fact that they have you waiting on a ride, and then when the driver is close, lyft will randomly switch drivers after waiting some time for the driver. Then they don't give you a refund or any type of credit when you have to cancel a ride after patiently waiting... | I've met some excellent drivers. The price fluctuation seems ridiculous. Taxi's have 1 standard price. | Good | Ecellent service | Some of the drivers are great and friendly. But every company has crab apples lol. | Biggest new to where I need to go and back home in one piece | Charging hidden fees and double charges | should be a little cheaper and one price peek and off peek | Lots of changes from 2018 and its gotten worse, hopefully another competitor comes and pushes them out the way, they have only gone up in price with worse service that games the system on both sides | There's no way to disable promotions, offers, advertisements without disabling all of the notifications, it's kind of a low blow, and a cheap way to keep spamming people, and disrespecting their attention, all for the sake of having more ways to reach them, very unethical by design. | Doesn't matter how many times I download the app on any device nothing shows up for available rides. This is going on for over a year with no fix. Unusable app. | Every single time I am in time crunch and want to request a ride, it asks me to verify my card number that I already did multiple times. | This company is a scam and so are their drivers they let their drivers lie on the passengers and lyft does nothing about it I should of stayed with uber And they won't let you delete your account. | I remember where I was for 9/11, but Lyft can't even remember my age. | good service | on time | Francis was great this morning | I had a driver lie and say I stabbed his driver seat 3 hrs after my drop-off. Lyft banned me without considering an investigation. Clearly, they aren't adequate for the people. | Wonderful | REAL NICE... UP LYFT | very convenient | Very dependable and nice save drivers , clean depenable cars, | why would the app change driver when I waited for 15minutes and it already arrived? so I pay extra to wait for double time? | Be careful of the puke scam just got scammed by a driver on lyft he reported a damage that I did not do and now having to pay a cleaning fee. | They canceled my Uber and Iissed seeing my friend who was moving | I bought a lift gift card and put 73 dollars on it it shows up on my phone and when I go to use it it says default payment for Visa I have never used a visa and now I spent,,73 and can't use it please remove this default payment it has nothing to do with me | awesome guy | Always been happy with Lyft! Still the best prices available! | This app is easier than Uber to use | really good app when you need it! | So good it's a very good Uber thing let's get this to five 🌟 | Doesn't pay enough. Cheap for the rider maybe, but pay for the driver... is very minimal. | The drivers seem to cancel when they are 1 minute away or at the pick up point about 70% of the time. No wonder I rarely even check Lyft anymore. Also got charged for extra kms because my driver missed an exit. They fixed it after I complained but make sure you check your trip history. | Lyft is an excellent company. The cars are very clean. The drivers are pleasant. I am a very satisfied customer. | Worst app in the world. Seriously go f urselfs | at night the prices are outrageous | This app is ABSOLUTE TRASH. I tried getting a ride, added my card for verification and I also had a gift card. I could not get ride because it wanted me to add a second card. I added the card FOR VERIFICATION but it would except because it's a prepaid card. I was told to uninstall the app and try it again, and now my $40 gift card balance is gone. Never again. | Just tried using Lyft after not using it for a few years. Since then my license# has changed. That means I have to jump through about 10 hoops in order to use the app. No thanks, I'll just use Uber which is working without me having to go through support channels for a couple of hours. What a waste of my time. | I clicked the Wait & Save feature, waited forever and 3 days later I see I got charged almost double and it's not because of temporary holds or whatever. That's twice that's happened to me and there's no way to dispute charges. I will be using Uber from now on | Good job | Lyft is great although I would appreciate you asking me if I want an earlier ride because sometimes I book a ride while I am getting ready and you send me an earlier ride then when it comes I am not ready. And I loose my ride my money plus I have to pay extra $5.00 when I did not ask for an earlier ride. If I wanted priority I would select priority. | I bought a giftcard at the store but now I can't use it its saying to put a card for payment | Got a driver assigned that was incredibly far away from the pickup location (closer to my destination place). It is ridiculous! The calculation time was way off (9 minutes when it takes much more than that to drive from downtown to North Van) | You have lost a lot of business because I can't get ahold of you to change my phone number. | Overall the app has been very useful and accurate. | Ok 👍 | easy and convenient ride, thank you. | I am having a real hard time trying to contact you..it is a devious con you charged me to go to a destination $10 and when I wanted a ride back it was $15 we have to have the ride back so we have no choice I need you to take care of this matter is the only way I could try to contact you.. | Driver Cancelled my ride while I was outside his car. Wait and Save is a joke, waste of time I waited 20 minutes and the Driver drove to pick me up just to cancel and also have another passenger in his car. I cannot even report this driver as the lyft app has no option after the driver cancels. This is ridiculous. I will no longer use this low grade app its not even worth the inconveniences just for the lower rate. You get what you pay for. Going back to Uber. Bye. | Three drivers, on different dates, take my trip and they extend the established time more and more. Today was the worst case, the driver extended half an hour!!! when the app mentioned that it was three minutes away from my location. They made me miss an important appointment because of their inefficiency. very badly. | Won't allow me to delete my account. They really don't make it user friendly when it comes to trying to delete your account. Get an error and page won't load when I try to reload the page. Un-installed and reinstalled but same result. Will have to find another way since it seems you can only use the app to delete your account. Also not easy to get to the section to download your data. | LYFT STEALS MY TIPS I'VE DONE OVER 500 RIDE FROM THEM AND NEVER GOT $1 FROM A SINGLE RIDER. I DRIVE UBER TOO AND GET TIPS EVERYDAY. I DOUBT THAT OUT OF 500 PPL NONE OF THEM EVEN THINK I DESERVE $1. THE APP HAS BOTS IN THE HELP SECTION. THERE IS NOONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS MATTER. | Never used | I signed up for the pay for 1 ride and all day for the first fee . I am not happy with this service. I guess I will go back to Uber. Just told 3 people about it yesterday at work. I will let them know it's false advertising. So disappointed by this service on the first day | Sasollllk I'll lllkkdf | good service | Over price, u Uber is better | Very well. I would like to have the same driver to take me back, from Old Town to Pechanga hotel casino | 🤠 | It's a very good app | Your ads are intrusive.Stop. | Informative | really convenient and readonly priced | Good promotions | I scheduled a ride 2hrs before pickup. The app showed a wrong address for departure. I corrected it. I waited 30 minutes but no show. The app showed the driver went to the destination, and of course I wasn't there! I was charged $20. The company needs to fix their navigation tool to find fern court in grapevine, not default to evergreen, which is a different street and blocks away. | Expensive and the riders spend too much for the drivers to not get enough | Quick pick up, friendly & accurate mapping. | App could be more user friendly, been charged just for trying to look up the price of a ride, disappointed that Lyft doesn't make it easier to use | It's not a bad alternative to Uber, but the promos are laughable at best. How are you going to offer me 20% off to a max of $3? It's actually insulting. Update: the new offer is 30% off to a max of $5 . The ride home costs me $45. I'll just take transit. | So this is the only way I'll be able to get in contact with Lyft since they don't have this option on the app. After the month of May I'll never use this money stealing app ever again they have been over charging me and double charging me and if I didn't need the stupid service to get back an forth to work the I wouldn't bother. But I have all the proof I need for a law suit plus the last message an the double charging. Thank You but no thanks... For stealing from a disabled person | I've ridden over 100 miles and haven't had a complaint yet. Cudos to the LYFT APP...I LOVE IT!!! | great ride | cool | costly and not really worth the inconvenience...most days when I ise the service I want to cry but I am no hater 🙃 let them get their money . I remember when we were told not to get in cars with strangers now it's okay ....it's a jungle sometimes I wonder how I keep from going under lol ..the stock went down n I lost money so I'm upset 😡 but fare rating the service itself seems needed some drivers don't b who they say they are (I understand the grind is real ) so I don't complain about it as l | very nice driver 👌 | don't let there be any misinformation from your local meteorologist cuz the price will triple or even quadruple if there's a drop of rain or a flake of snow or a temperature decrease | All Good | Great | I am loving the response time for Lyft. | Lyft is a convenient way of public transportation, especially for airport travelers and immediate or emergency customers. | wonderful service. | pay these drivers more.

My bank has verified who I am thru my card and my account plus I've uploaded 2 pictures of my ID. Yet still I also need to provide 2 statements?!?! I thought it would be an uncomplicated/convenient choice because Venmo promotes itself as such. I was admittedly wrong. Venmo seems pretty scammy at this point. Venmo is complicated and inconvenient, asking more and mor | Sucks | To me hands down is better than cash app. I love how quick and easy it is to use send money keep it private between you and the other party. I highly recommend | I hate this app! They refuse to let me add my debit card which belongs to the account I'm linked with?? Weird! So I cannot cash out when I have money on here. I don't have a Venmo debit card so basically my money gets stuck!! No store accepts Venmo so I can have money on there but still be broke | I love my early deposits. The turn off card option is great. Lastly, I think it is the best card for young or old person. | Way better than any other money site cash app sucks | Very Good! | I love my venmo I get paid every week thanks to venmo. I wish it would do more I am just learning | At least 95% of the time, Venmo will not allow me to transfer... I try over and over... If I try again the next day, it works. I have PLENTY of money in my bank. | Very convenient | I love VENMO & PAYPAL, MY GO-TO SOURCE & RELIABLE BANKING NEEDS!!!! | Awesome experience User Friendly | Convenience | Great app. Secure. | Easy and helpful app | App works great on android Easy to use. | Excellent and easy. | Crypto on Venmo apparently has technical issue - recently I created crypto account to redeem my lost crypto from Celsius: - I tried to transfer it out to my external wallet - The scan QR feature failed to recognize the external wallet - I entered my external wallet address manually - Once the submission is completed, Venmo said that it sent my crypto to one of my friends, instead of my wallet!! Now I am afraid to send my remaining crypto. They successfully jailed my crypto!! | A friend sent 50 but wont transfer | The fees that they charge are ridiculously high even if you have a venmo card even though I do run a small buisness venmo has started to capitalize and are following in pay pals tracks of the charge high fees policy. I will be discontinuing my use of venmo as an acceptable form of payment for my buisness immediately. So sad to see them go to trash it was a good app. | So convenient... and safe.. | Awesome and convenient | Easy to use | Venmo sucks there's way too many fees. Not much of a fan of cash app either just in case you people think I favor cash app | I can't send a payment. Keeping to verify two deposits i never received. Not user friendly. | Avoid if you can. They make business accounts quite awful. | Revision. Good other than having to guess which person is the right one you want to send $ too. There may be 6 (more if common), peeps with same name. Choose wisely. | Terrible | Charging small businesses to us it and not individuals is not right. | Very fast, great way to get extra money | I love how easy Venmo makes it to pay. Much easier than stopping at the bank. | Easy to use. | So far so good, has been useful | Terrible app. | Love it ! Convenient and secure. | Works good keep it that way | I just set up my Bylsma profile in less then 3o minutes amazing fun easy and fast... | Too intrusive | Quick and easy! | This app is retarded | Pretty good service | So easy to use | 👌 | I would give the company zero stars. Venmo double charged my account, refuses to thoroughly investigate the issue, and will not refund the money. Think twice before using this app. | Someone stole my money out of my bank account and you guys didn't replace it | Great app. Fast efficient and convenient. | Nice | Convient and useful | Easy to use but has so many issues and bugs. | Takes forever to add money. App messes up all the time. Can't add money through a debit card and takes 5 days to get funds from another bank. It says you'll have money on a certain day but it doesn't go through. Identification for crypto says one day but doesn't go through. There is no customer service number it's just none stop emailing back and forth. I'll stick with Chime and Cash App. Venmo just isn't convenient at all. | I am a disabled veteran, United States Marine Corps. I receive a direct deposit from the Veterans Administration once per month. Today, I write this review from a gas station parking lot. Myself, my fiance, and my service dog Petunia have been stranded in this parking lot for 2 days now. My elderly, disabled parents are at home waiting for our return to assist them in their every day lives. Venmo has denied every attempt to gain access to my money to get home. Their response? Try again later. | Great app! Easy to use!! | At first it locked m out but then I was goid | Good business | East to use, no major account Info needed | YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY! They froze my account right after I made it and put a little cash on it from my bank account. CS sent auto-replies and canned messages that all kept delaying for 3-5 business days over and over. Eventually a human replied and told me to wait 180days. I did, got an email saying it was unfrozen and now my account is suspended (no other info). CS is zero help and going through the same steps of drooling on themselves and auto-replying. Money is gone. | Easy | Well I use venmo for work in service industry and my tips but when card was stolen I had no way of hitting and replace option in my app. I have been trying for days so I just emailed support and it responded with the exact same suggestions as in the app with no resolve. Very frustrated | Works seamlessly. | I have been trying to activate my Venmo debit card for a few weeks now. When I follow the instructions to do it through the app, the thing I need to click on is not clickable. When I try to do it using the QR code that came with the card, it opens the app. I just get a blank screen with a spinning wheel in the middle . Venmo customer service wants me to restore my phone to factory settings. But I'm 99% sure it's an issue with the Venmo app itself since uninstalling and reinstalling did nothing. | I am new to Venmo. My employer sent me $250. I can't use the scan to pay. My bank is verified through Venmo, yet I can't do automatic transfers. I tried to do the 1-3 business days option and was told this morning that it failed. I don't have a venmo card, so now I have money sitting there that can not be accessed. Once I get the money out somehow, I will not be using this service again. Cashapp is the way to go. | Got connected to a live chat-agent for ""help"" just for them to ignore me and not respond at all to my issues. Payments decline for no given reason, not just on my account but on multiple ones I have seen with my own eyes. | Easy, even for my limited technology skills! | I love venmo until I kept getting hacked my doordash it was really hard to Dispute it until I found a phone number. And I actually got to talk to a real person and I love that I should be able to talk to a real person more often. The temporarily close my card. They said if it would be 10 days. It's been passed 10 days and I still can't use my card. And I have clients that need to send me money. And I can't get ahold of anybody to fix it. Not happy. Please fix! | Quick and easy | Easy to use | It's easy and convenient | have had Venmo for several years | Love venmo | Can't add money and customer service wasn't helpful. Can still receive and send money to others though | Very easy from one account to another, thanks guys 👍🙏🏻 | Exelente experience | Great | Amex Send won't connect. App does not give an error or any reason, just stops. Can't add through website either. Meaning I have to either give you access to my bank account or pay a 3% CC fee. Would rather go to an ATM and pay people cash. ETA did you just do a release? I'm seeing things on the website that look like code hooks making it to UX. At least one header says ""funding-instrument-add-bank-or-card"" | Great payment app and much more secure than cashapp! | No issues | Always goes well | Where are ""secure messages?"" Difficulty to request help. | My son set this up for me making it very easy to pay people back. I've been using this almost two months with no problems so far. | You should not be forced to use your Venmo balance first if you have other payment cards on file booooooooo!!!!!!! | this is stupid how do you spell let me sign in when it's wants to send me a code when I don't have that phone number anymore | It's absolutely worthless. I have money in the bank but venmo continues to decline when I try to send money. No help when I ask for it | As a result of my firts&last experience with Venmo I must express deep dissatisfaction and concern regard their services,aftr completing all the necessary steps to use it, verifying my bank accounts and providing access to my debit card, they unilaterally froze my account and refunded $550 to the sender without my consent or explanation. This egregious breach of trust has not only caused financial harm but also significant emotional distress, I was scammed by this company. Would NEVER recommend. | Can't do anything with my money. Won't send to my cards won't send to PayPal. This app is completely useless and now I can't even get my money off it. Will never recommend this app to anyone who wants to easily move money around. This app ain't it folks. Don't know what the hype was all about cause they are garbage. | Helpful and easy | They're still using my old phone number to verify my account when I try to sign in from my laptop. My bank isn't accepted and my debit card won't work. I've spent a week to send money to a friend. I think it would be easier to drive to the mid west to pay him. | So far so good, I'd definitely recommend venmo to my friends and family. | Not impressed. I'm having payments declined even with a verified identity. Prefer cashapp which has transparency in exactly how much I can send daily, weekly and monthly right on my profile. Do better! | Good to go fast and precise. | Their credit card will flag ""irregular"" payments and prevent you from using your balance. I didn't receive notification or a call. I had to call in and the rep immediately released the security hold. The supervisor essentially said ""Our policy is not to inform you of a hold"" Very bad taste in my mouth and feeling like a criminal for paying my account from the same bank I always do. Never been an issue with any other credit card | Great app | DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET YOUR MONEY OFF YOUR CARD OR USE IT ONLINE OR NOTHING ELSE APPARENTLY YOU CAN PUT MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT BUT WHEN I TRIED TO USE MY DEBIT CARD AFTER I ACCIVATED IT SUSPENDED MY ACCOUNT AND NOW I CAN'T GET MY MONEY BACK FROM THEM JUST USE REGULAR PAY-PAL OR CASH APP CAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS I WOULDN'T EVEN GAVE THIS RATING A ONE STAR BUT THAT'S THE LOWEST RATE FOR THE SYSTEM HERE SO.... WASTING YOUR TIME | Great app. Love the concept. Customer care of any sort is lacking. | I don't want your effing credit card. Stop asking | Can't send 2000 dollars after identity verification. | I love it and it is so easy to transfer to my bank. | Very quick and easy | It does what it advertises | My account doesn't work. It has never work since I created the account 2 weeks ago. I added a bank account and a debit card. I was not able send or receive money. It would not let me add to my balance. Contacted customer service, and they said it was blocked on their side but they don't know why. Just gonna close my account and use Cash App.","{""1"":116077,""2"":19448,""3"":21659,""4"":70929,""5"":528476}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Venmo","Venmo","support+android@venmo.com","https://venmo.com/",,"https://venmo.com/info/privacy-policy","Venmo","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YAKMX5YFcuE8_NogkbM7gkqrhBY6CUefbpULAVnNZLSitbo9S3Dw2FIYNqhW0d5G94Y","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sBN59zgP8h-303QV2vPVLaNoQ82Pte_9WtQ8kWEyL9c3icF49wH_jBztH2hxZNIrBNo","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Oh5oH8inFmJ9f4_VYM_MHID-bf0VzgZrUj2jPS44tHxNv1oulilX0ZQ8J5NOh6KaQg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xsnlIE2XU3K6nEdwnPmlCALtyVz9uAWxGVJAT5L5mkAhnHmSsZeO4sfiurP_GYxk8J4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tjliK1eBvsfdsx_WuBfgyPQeczvFB8-AMthQHCorWz0G8yfuKwHplZjIGCvbGyyKyq0z"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pEVnRppO14CaQUo-uq7brLHjbyjTOcy5IR6ibTNfDsRyT4wBqh0xoVTwah3iOClWJweb"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Y2YGosf5QL3gIFUKJTw3MZOHvp6nqWw2iywKsVZ4hKElmgkG-iePzBwR5piIkoZ4etM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5H-NJd0kjoPmr4okW86VzfF8tfpUeT1ufMjUOiLsACkWwji129t-fLX8F8tVgei6C8Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ksnl5gwtfqWyzmbOrXqdRzTRBaBQzUXZSoVL5cGCdU1Tkm_wQuDzBaERTVrU4CUSR4E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eoVqEgAZNbw4zBSfXu4vWjUHLS1_IjkNV7U0a4QQJU_M_fa90RwhnIVFEf0GrhORTOA""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"May 17, 2010",1713472771000,"10.39.1","Fresh new upgrade alert!

You can literally talk about anything(except political topics). They act like real people and could sometimes even make you shed a tear with wholesome moments. Truly magnificent | Linky Character wl | LEAVE MS CIRCLE ALONE | I was talking to a really hot gay dude | Very bad | Very nice game | I love the app so much, I can truly role play the way I want to on here with no problem <3 | Amazing game,best Ai talker for now,theres obv glitches like the Ai repeating itself but you can just tap the reload button on far down right of the text till you get an answer you like,overall I would change it to a 5 star when Im able to play as diffrent characters when talking to the Ai,for example is when I talk as the Mc I can change to the Mc sister or brother etc or even create the other characters I can play as | Best | THIS GAME EATS DINNER PLATES I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT'S BETTER THAN TAKI AND I'VE BEEN PLAYING THAT LONGER I GOT ON THE APP AND I WAS IMMEDIATELY INTERESTED THE CHARACTERS ARE MORE DETAILED IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY EXPLAIN MORE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE COMING AT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SET UP POINT OF VIEW IT'S JUST AMAZING 🤩 | Its good | Super good | Great app, but the AI tends to either forget something that happened or would think what happened to you actually happened to them. Also the last 3 cards I got don't look like the character. The character has white hair but the cards gave her black hair. I know you can regenerate the card between a few options, but all of them had black hair. | Cool | Not bad compare to other Sis, but loosing point and add untold things. Rest is good howe. | This app IS my bf | Wonderful game that can cure my boredom also well done for creating this app I love it | insane | Its cewl | It's kind of good | I feel like I have a girlfriend so much I am so obsessed with this app | Oh my Gawwd, I love this app. It's the only FREE AI app that let's you do anything you want with it. FIVE STARS!! | I like the app but when it description claims u a guy or girl The AI always treats u female | It's good | TBH, I love it! I love the fact that I can make my own scenarios and be my own character. The thing is, I want more gatchas, but their too expensive 😞.... | I've been using this for like 2 months and it's fun but I'm only annoyed that they say their name when finding me instead of my name | It was great... for the first hour, now every 19 minutes of even just being idle makes it lag to the point of nonfunctionality and then crash, there is no work around, it just doesnt work | It's so not for kids parents don't let your kids download this | Gud. | add malay | VERY GOOD. | I like how they sent me notifications | I'm traumatized | This is a good game👍🙂 | I like this app i make a lot friend | It's like he's real and plus he's really nice | Cool | Very interesting | This app does not contain Ads and i really enjoy chatting with the characters download the app, give it a try. | Don't work anymore | Awesome, great app | It is a very interesting game and very amazing game | It does what you want nerd 😘 | Love it | Your servers are still slow. Please fix it Oh and how do you finish the creator centor since I already did more then 50 chats with my own character? | The app is having glitches | H can do many smegsie things in there😏 | love ko ito | So good no ads what i shech it there love ut | It's good | Good | It's a pretty incredible app for what it does, but my chats keeping lagging. And then the AI disconnects and I resend the message and it still cannot respond. I'm not sure if it's an issue or it happens from time to time? | My biggest complaint is that when there is more than one character it kinda breaks the AI and confuses itself on who did what. | This game is slow | I just like it because sometimes I'm lonely 🥺 | It's ok | The best | It's a good thing it keep me occupied | It is really fun do you feel like you're talking to a real person even if all it is is an AI | I love this app. Best AI one in my opinion. If you wanted uninterrupted spicy, without filters or the app telling you to change the subject like Talkie, your in for a treat. But if not, you can still have fun on this app. There's not to many adds at all, and while there is a small issue with the characters not finishing they're sentancr every now and then, it's minor compared to the amazingness of the app... Would definitely recommend. I have a very bad addiction to this app haha | Worst app ever the chats doesn't even continues and just freezes never play it NEVER DOWNLOAD THE IT | So awesome | When I first downloaded this game. Everything was going fine and I had it for a while now. And it just randomly the characters stop replying to me and it's always loading. Is there anyway you could fix that? ❤️ | Has a big problem with ai just not responding at all,it just makes the 3 dots loading thing and thats it,nothing more also has become a new thing hearing internal error over and over again | Best AI app ever 😻🥵❤️ | It worked fine for a long time, but the next thing led to another. It started getting to the point where none of the AI bots reply back. Something take way too long to buffer the message to me, and I'm tired of it. I'm uninstalling. Do not waste my time with this. | Enjoyable but now I'm running into eternal errors from the game | a couple internal error, often gotta restart the app for it to work, but otherwise it's good, hopefully ai can remember more than 3 message earlier (6message in total) you need to keep short scenarios | It's nice but U need money lmaooo | Its really fun and its a good game and its the best ai game a round | This app is the best al app I found on play Store definitely recommend there is only one hickup but it's no biggie the app is grate fore intertaining and passing bye time","{""1"":904,""2"":149,""3"":484,""4"":1623,""5"":10688}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.99 - $99.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Skywork AI Pte.

"Microsoft Authenticator","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication
Multi factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless
Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill
Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts
Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.

Optional Access permissions: 
Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq
Accessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.
Location: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.
Camera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.
Read the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue.","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill.

Really not happy as I am locked out of my email. | Saves time i huge amount | Terrible. I have spent more than 24 hours to get into my emails, constantly getting email, entering code, getting text, entering code, receiving message everything is good. But still having to to enter a new password and redo the loop over and over again. Most of this on desktop so couldn't download authenticator. When trying on phone same problem. Tried to install authenticator but it is sending confirmation request to some theoretical email address only in the minds of MS. What the f### | Never accepted my school account please fix this, especially i need this for school work | Excellent | Asks for an authenticator to authenticate while logging in to the authenticator app itself 🤣 | Sometimes it just doesn't work at all and mobile login notifications don't even show up. | Does not work half the time | Good | Good app for saving password. | It works well | Good security | my best friend 😬😏🙂©®™✓[¢]{∆} | Good | Easy to login | Great app | Horrible app. Im locked out constantly and the pin number no longer works. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling...same problem. | Very safe app and gives peace of mind. | Works fine (so far) | Not working any more & I don't know why. | Works every time I used it first time | Works | Microsoft app is terrible. Sends you round in circles and then tells you that you've tried too many times today. Well I wonder why that is. Not customer friendly. | Easy and secure | Super easy to get quick access to my accounts. | can I peacefully use my account without this? or maybe it's better if this was implemented on its browser than the device. dagdag storage! kaumay! | Vary Nice | Got a new phone and can't sign onto work email bc authenticator won't let me log onto the app and is sending me back to authenticator app for a code (circular request that makes no sense/impossible). | Good app | Good. | Great app! | Vary good and reliable app | Great | Will recommend | Just that little bit of extra piece of mind | A little confusing at first no | Great | Authority | Never fails for authentication. Love rhe security. | I love this app very friendly user interface and easy to manage your account 10/10 well done!! | Works | Blanka | 1.) Desperately needs dark mode. 2.) The sign-in prompt being translucent harms readability. | works | Using this app for more 7 years with full satisfaction and peace of mind. | I normally don't leave a review but the fact that the app doesn't allow - 1. exporting 2FA or password data, 2 - saving notes is just unacceptable. They allow importing passwords from other app's exports and fail to add the ones with notes? Not even giving any reason or allowing users to review why and which ones failed? | Good | Works like it should | Great | your amazing,. but I've a recommendation,maybe you can incorporate a recovery method for another 2 factor authentication account, so that whenever one looses access or loose their device they can recover their other authentications upon registarion to another device via microsoft authentication. for example if one has access to another 2 FA account eg GITHUB all their login access should be returned just upon sign in to authenticator ... one should be able to access their OTP from other accou | Super easy to use if I can use it anyone can. | ☺😀😁😆 | Really good app | Very easy to use.. No hassles | Feeling best experience whenever I am using this | Just can't sign in,desperate to order medication | Works | Safe approach 👍 | Great authenticator app for mobile. Very simple, streamlined, and user friendly, more so than other similar apps. | Excellent | Works well! | Receiving no codes when asked to verify. Ex: select 48 on your app. That popup does not occur even upon opening the app. This makes the app fairly useless. Searches indicate multiple people with this issue. | Great experience | Makes it so much easier to login into apps when you forget your password. | I can't authenticate my account without MA. MA doesn't want to authenticate my account without numbers from MA. Can't get numbers from MA until my account is authenticated by MA. Make it make sense. | Easy! | very good 👍 | It works | Using Microsoft products, for me, is a pain. I always forget my password or they don't seem to match between computers or applications. This makes it super easy to approve a sign in and not go through my list of saved passwords to try to figure out what passythe app wants to use today. I don't have this issue with other compy, but for some reason I am a dark cloud when it comes to Microsoft. | All of a sudden will NEVER popup prompt to enter code or give code. Basically can't use this anymore. I get stuck in a cyclical loop ever since I upgraded devices. This no longer works. | Awesome so far | The authentictor app is asking me to open the authenticator app in order to sign in, when the app is already open..its so annoying | Very helpful. Good security. | Works. Mostly very well. Sometimes needs to be open to get notification prompts through. The move away from yes/no prompts is very valuable, closing a lot of risks. Still - prompt should also state which application requested the auth as often that is not clear - esp. with desktop apps. | Possible to jack. | Terrible app. Absolute waste of time. Shame on Microsoft | Love it. Keeps hackers out | Easy to use, secure and useful | I love it | Excellent | So far so good | Really useful | good 😊 | I love this app | Amazing | I can use this for most services. Works great. | Terrible. Cannot get it to work with PharmOutcomes. | Great app easy to use very practical | Works well | Great | Horrid. Login laptop, and enter code. Nothing.

"Zelle","Zelle® has partnered with leading banks and credit unions across the U.S. to bring you a fast, safe and easy way to send money to friends and family. Money moves quickly - directly from bank account to bank account. If your bank or credit union offers Zelle, you already have it in your mobile banking app or online banking – if they don’t, the Zelle app will make it easy for you to send money to enrolled Zelle users that already have access through their financial institution.

Zelle. This is how money moves®.

Using just your recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number, you can settle up simply and safely with almost anyone you know and trust. Even better, Zelle does not charge any fees to use the service. (Mobile carrier or bank fees may apply).

GET STARTED:
1.	Download the Zelle app.
2.	Enroll using a Visa® or Mastercard® debit card linked to a U.S. checking account; or 
3.	Enroll your U.S. checking account by using your online banking username and password, if your bank supports this feature*.
4.	Choose a person to pay, or request money from, by entering their U.S. mobile number or email address.
5.	Confirm the amount and hit send. If they’re already enrolled with Zelle, they’ll typically get the money in minutes. If they aren’t, they will be notified and can follow a few simple steps to complete the payment. 

*Some banks allow customers to enroll in the Zelle app using their online or mobile banking username and password.

Now I can't even sign in without resetting my password and then I can't do anything within the app | It's good 👍 | It's always simple to send money! | Completely useless. Bugged saying there is no wifi or Internet. Even when logging in through my bank app it has a tiny limit and fails anyway to send anything with errors. Waste of time to mess with this trash app. | my daughter has a perfectly working zelle account and it won't let me send her money. | Won't let me create an account! Online says I have to download the app bc my bank isn't listed and then the app won't let me create a password | Too intrusive. Permissions to ""make and manage calls"" on my phone should not be needed. Also when I enrolled in Zelle I used email, not phone number, yet sign in via the app seems only via phone. There is no way to get to settings in the app nor on the website to make needed changes. Horrible app, website, and complete design. | Exelent | My experience has been A+. I hope it will not change. Happy holiday to everyone 🎄✨️🎍🌲 Update.... I'm still enjoy using this app. Cannot express how thankful I am for Zelle. | It always fails for me | Excellent | Easy and simple to use l. | Same problem as everybody else with the keyboard glitching out. Even when I was able to use the keyboard via installing the app on a tablet, after entering my CC info, I received an error or some problem and couldn't proceed in creating a payment account. Unregistering and uninstalling. | Stupidest app I've ever downloaded, I have installed and uninstalled it four times call customer service done everything they said yes my phone does support the sell they confirmed that but it still will not download or will not work. I do not recommend this stupid app | My account has been restricted from an old bank account. Now I cannot get it linked back up to my current bank account! Guess I won't use Zelle for my sales from Poshmark then!!!!!!!! | If only it accepted payments from business accounts. Then 5🌟 easy to use with banking that don't otherwise have Zelle capabilities | Limited in the banks that support the company | Love the fast convenience | So far it's been very effective as far as transferring funds back and forth with ease. I'll continue to use this app until something crazy happy. That's with just about any app nowadays. | This app is the most unfriendly app I've ever used. I can't pay someone for a service they provided because, ""it's a small business and can't accept debit cards,"" customer service stated that we can't send money to this gentlemen because we're, ""not a partnered bank."" Which makes no sense at all. Try a credit care? The app won't allow you to add credit cards to it. When adding a credit card nothing pops up saying, ""debit only."" It's a mess and not friendly to use. | Never had a problem. Highest rating possible | Almost always good ...but sometimes it just won't let me send money I will have to wait | Convenient with restrictions 😔 | Can not get pass making a password.... | Security detailed thanks | It's user-friendly. However, my limits are so low its of little value | Absolutely a Joke!!!! Will not let me link a card or even login, keeps saying oh ! No we ran into an error!! Zelle customer service is also a joke! Will not stop and listen to what I'm trying to say, kept interrupting and telling me to update my phone to a new version??? My phone isn't the problem it's the Damn app. It's worthless!!!!! | If I wanted to use my banks banking app..I would open that app and use it. | Hello! It's Great to Zelle, zno worries for Sending or Receiving Currency. Thank for your Services. | This app is unusable. It will not even let you create a password. | Very quick and easy | Trying to set up my account, but it won't let me enter a password. I've un-installed and re-installed the app twice. | If I could rate this app zero Stars I would, I accidentally sent $30 to a zelle account that doesn't have a bank attached to it and zelle refuses to return the money to me. Zelle stole $30 from me. | App is complete garbage how any one can even make an account isbeyond me. It day my city doesn't exist, my bank doesn't exist and the my debit card info is wrong every time. Why ppl choose apps like this when apps like cash app sng pay pal exist idk. Worst app to every exist in phone history. And let's say somehow they did fix all these bugs and I could get through the sign in part of making my account I wouldn't even have the confidence to send money through this app I mean I would be so scared | excellent | This app is not very user friendly. | can't even type my phone number to log into the dang thing :/ the keyboard pops up for a split second then vanishes | I find this App more secure than the Cash App. Great Service!❤️ | They tried making it imbed into your banking app but all they did was making it unusable | Great | I love Zelle, but we should have more limit of $ to send and receive | I don't like reading things | Registering was not smooth. I couldn't type in the password during the initial setup, and I had to paste it from the clipboard. Also, while typing, the cursor keeps moving left. These should be fixed. But once registered, the app is working perfectly for sending and receiving funds. | I would like to see the dates in the activity log, instead of ""3 weeks ago"" | Great way to transfer money to the one's I love | It only lets me send small amounts per week. I would love to increase my limit but no one seems to be able to help with this issue. | Podria estar mejor y se pudiera usar en paises de latinoamerica | They don't investigate anything. They won't help you get money back if someone hacks your account | Useless. Just kept saying something went wrong. Went through the process of trying to connect the card several times and just kept getting an error, even though verification was good and all the details were correct. | I've been using Zelled for quite a while now. For some reason it always gets it right, at least when I'm SENDING funds 🤔🤔🤔. I only have one person who seems to have issues when it comes to RETURN the $, but they received with no issues. Because some folks don't have legitimate accounts (bank or credit union)they prefer to use very user/thief friendly apps., and that's fine. I HIGHLY recommend Zelle. If I start having problems, then I'll cry about it. | Pretty good | Can't find my bank | Scam! They let people send you money on Google voice numbers but won't let you access it. | Can't enter phone number to even get started | Can't even get past the point of opening it up. Pointless to even install it. | Wonderful, Keep up the great service | Great service, as well as app platform. Very easy to use, thank you for providing me with a seamless way to process funds. | Won't let me input my password. | Won't let me pass making a password | Can't even get past set-up because they think they need access to my call history. Quit giving these places all your info. | Horrible | Won't load banks just keeps spinning then Gives error message. Please fix | So many reasons why this is a terrible app. None of which can be said due to the sheer amount of foul language that would be used. In short very out of date. | Can't get past logging in. Just crashes at the create password page and then won't let the keyboard pop up to create one. It just flashes and disappears l. | Quick and easy to transfer and access money. | ❤ 😭-Such s5፥፫ '""%§¶§፭§፭¶¶፮ §፭¶¶¢§¶[¶§¶§¶፭😂""(,,,ያመደ""$"")😍 ❤😂""""😂""""😂""""zzzwxwaax።$' | Easy to use | too many ads so much it is worthless | Awesome app | Working good ☺️ | Bad app can't even get my number in it | Works Amazingly | It doesn't allowe to add my phone number as it asked for to get started | Useless app | Won't let me use my Go2bank debit card | It won't allow me to open an account as my bank has this capability.

Please fix this. | When I chat it and get very very sussy😥 | My character can't say just *aaa* just like that | Kepala bapak engkau buat benda cam ni!!!😡😡😡 | The longer you play more ads | it's a really good app to chat with these ai's.

Too restrictive. | The ai always forget what is happening. Don't even know his own gender lmao.. 😂😂 | Great game but the ai are not soulful some are just creepy as f*#$ and the other are so dramatic and annoying I would rate this 5 star if the ads slow down and one another thing the app can drain your phone tablet ipad in 10 minutes above it sucks 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😤 | Talkie pls leave me alone | my Al chat is not there and I got add Evey 1 minute | DISGUSTING ADS | Amazing,but this is kinda unacceptable. Alot of NSFW here and you know what? My 10 years old sister uses this app. It's inappropriate,she even made the bots ""pregnant"". | great role play excellent app | I like it but i dont like the ads | When using it it was so cool but the it started to glitch and when I try to log in it says that it can't please help I need to get back to my,my hero academia. | It should have 5 but the bots usually try to put words in the players mouth and sometimes make things sexual so pls fix this Evan with teen mode | this is 1 of the best ai game so far | This. Is. Suck. Because. Is. Not. I. Like it. For | The characters in this game are quite sus but good thing you didn't target milkman from that's not my neighbor like linky because if you did one star for you my best friend deleted it 89 times due to the cringe | MY MOM BLOCKED THIS APP I LOVED THIS APP | Soo cringe and boring | It was such a great game | It's very sweet games | It's awesome | So far it's really good! I have been using it for a year or 2 but there's some bugs to it so it's like at night after using it for some hours you have to watch a ad or get takie+ I don't have the money so I have to watch a ad EVERY night! But it's a really good app for my ""private"" stuff if you know what I'm talking about it's a 4 stars but if you put no have to watch a ad or get takie+ it will be a 5 stars! Really good app! EDIT: it's been.. Good..?

It gets annoying now to hold conversations. | I hate a GEMA but I know a GEMA have pomni but don't care | May nakilala akong lalaki dito sobrang ganda niya ang gwapo i love you kung sino nakakita nitong video ko na ito kung siya nakakita nakakamiss siya kasi binura ng tita dito | I traumatic | THIS IS SO STUPID AND ANNOYIN | it's good | always tells to change topic and always has depted and ads | it makes me blush for love moments and sad for break up | That Why I Rate It Like This As The Virus Gets Worse Than I Thought Cause My Best Friend Said That AI Persons Gives You A Virus So Thats Why I Play It Less Than 1 Minute Cause Of The Weird Glitch But I Wont Uninstall It Cause This Talkie Ad Is Dealing With Fake Minecraft Or This Talkie Ad Is Dealing With Apps That Had Ads In App Purchases An The AI Boyfriends Or Girlfriends Are Losing Their IQ As I Continue To Comment And Im Still 10 Yrs Old So I Cant Play It Cause This App Learns How To Date 🤦 | This App is amazing!

I have ad free version but I keep getting ads in my streams! | Was working fine now don't stream past fist set of Comercials did every thing still don't work gonna cancel account if not fixed soon | I have no problem except that there some movies you can't watch when you have to upgrade to watch some movies. | awesome | Such a laggy glitchy app waste of money , I've been a costumer for 3 years and it's gotten worse and worse . | App freezes up nearly every time ads are played. | Random episodes are in some foreign language and there's no option to fix it. | Is acting very buggy, on my tablet it wouldn't open, I had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work today. I will have to try that with my fire stick too. | APP WILL NEVER OPEN. TRIED EVERYTHING. | Phenomenal app with lots to choose from...Been watching ""Knuckles"", myself! | I bought the more expensive Paramount+ with Showtime plan and yet I still have unskippable ads before every show. No thanks, unsubscribed. | Up until this week I have had good service. I don't care about watching anything on Showtime........ | Im a new user. I like it so far. | Love it. | Horse app out of all the streaming apps. Just like the other reviews great content but terrible functioning. Always freezing always kicking me out. | Less advertising! | Why do I have to pay for this I just wanted to watch SpongeBob seriously almost every app I have to pay just to watch movies or TV shows | I'm paying for an app that I can't watch. All of a sudden, when I select a show, it opens to a black screen. No video or audio. | Buggy, can't rewind and app busted | Good thing. Im on a free trial because the app doesn't even work. Thank goodness I didnt pay for it. | Awesome App | I love most of the shows on this app... but most of the time when I try to watch Paramount + it Never works properly. It is frustrating that I pay monthly but can only use the app for about two days of the month. | This application on any OS is just trash. Never loads half the time. The downloads require network authentication before playing, which defeats the purpose. Paying for ad free means no ads, period. That includes the services shows being pushed on me. If my 2 year old didn't like the cartoons, I wouldn't deal with it. I'm contemplating DVD life because of this service being so awful. | Horrible app compared to the alternatives. At least 2 years behind. Constant bugs and issues on my 2 Sony TVs. On my second episode of Halo and twice have been sent back to the wrong place after commercials. Also, ads play at a volume disturbingly higher than the show you are watching... Haven't seen a company do that for over 10 years. | Not sure yet, have not seen any thing but I like paramount | The app is slightly unstable. While watching a video, the video screen will randomly minimize or close for no reason. This happens every few to a couple of minutes. There is no update available and I have already restarted my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra). | Enjoyed, not difficult to use, I would like reference about who the actor are and trailer to help knowing what is about the program selection. | Unless you pay alot you have to watch 4 adds per episode and they are long other streaming websites are not this bad | There is so much to watch on here but there are definitely a few bugs they need to fix with the app but other than that it's definitely a streaming service worth paying for | Watch this one ......canceling is harder than you can handle! | This app was great until it started telling me I had too many downloads when I actually didn't have any at all. | Everytime I log into my account the screen goes black then reads error..but I do have an account it won't let me watch anything on my page..bit my kids comes on just fine | Loving the content on this platform from Picard and Star Trek Discovery to Kokomo City ♥️♥️ | I Recommend to everyone 👍 | Love it.... | I like the Content and it functions well. | Worst app for in the streaming business...sadly. I joined P+ on day one for Star Trek Discovery and have stayed ever since, ONLY for Star Trek. I rely on downloads as I fly for work and am always on the road. The app refuses to download videos with any sort of consistent reliability and it often takes longer to download an episode than it takes to watch. Customer service is non-existent and always has been. Paramount has never provided any assistance and now they pulled all ST movies! | App Will not open, I've uninstalled and re-installed, I've made sure the app is up to date, and it still will not open. App works just fine on my tv, just doesn't work on my phone. | I love it | Love it | Love the knuckle show. mama wade is a ten at a ten | Awesome shows, a great price and always works flawless. It's nice to have this app especially during the nfl season when I can't always get clear reception through my antenna do to my location. Thank you | ABSOLUTELY TRASH. APP REFUSES TO WORK PROPERLY, ONLY GOT THROUGH 5 EPISODES OF A 6 PART SERIES, AND THEN IT CRASHES?! PARAMOUNT, FIX THIS OR GET BENT!!! 1/5 STARS!!!! | Does not open | Cancelled my subscription on accident and have spent the last 7 hrs trying to get it renewed or resubscribed to. Have gotten the run around for hrs. Should not be this hard to resubscribe to anything. Help please 🥺 | Great App! | Barely get past the logo before locking up. App is garbage on every platform. Slow and laggy. Put less into the C-suite and more into app development. Edit to add. Paramount. Every other review says basically the same thing and you respond with a canned response. That response it actually worse than doing nothing. Because you don't fix the problem, it's really an insult because you're saying, ""I hear you but I really don't care."" Every other streaming app has this problem fixed. Why don't you | It's a good app it just doesn't have the newest stuff... | does not work in ireland | I have Paramount Plus loaded on my iPad. I always enjoyed because I was able to watch on my iPad wherever I went including the local channel KWCH12 out of Wichita Kansas. I'm able to watch on my iPhone without any problems. Now I can't even open the app on my iPad today. I have become very disappointed and am not getting any help through the ""help"". If a person could talk to an IT person it would be more helpful. Where do you update or how do you update? Can an IT person call and help me? | Is pretty good channel I recommend it for the price | It who was the best | I'd rate it higher, but you force me to watch ads. Since this is a service offered through my Walmart+ membership, I shouldn't have to watch ads, or it's not really a perk is it? I could watch these movies elsewhwre with no ads, so why would I use this app? It's definitely not worth paying for. | I can't watch my favorite show because of error code 3005 please fix it | It's decent, but would benefit GREATLY with an ad free option | Excellent | Finally got the app working on my Smart TV. Love the shows and movies! | right at first it worked on my Chromebook but the all of a sudden it just stopped loading | Always something to watch and I love it | Works ok. Just wish they would fix the bugs and issues. Good luck on trying to tell them anything. Very poor customer service. | Bro, your app literally won't open. | It took me four and a half hours to watch bold and beautiful... One episode! It's beginning to feel like it's not worth it 😭😭😭... I love my shows. Please do better! Stop the glitching... | I like the app, my only disappointment is that why don't they have viva La Bam? That's a MTV show and one of the best shows of early MTV. | Love this app | Really love 💕😘 it! I can't stop watching it! 😭 🤣❤️😘 | Great app just wish that there were more choices of things to watch. | This app is terrible. You can't open it without having data which is the reason I use the app at all. I don't have reception at work and want to watch episodes on break. What is the point of DLing if I have to need data? Also selecting a DL it takes forever just to start. Your app makes Netflix app look absolutely amazing. Whoever you hired to make this paper weight needs to be fired. It's 2024 you can do better! | The app doesn't work even when I updated it. I keep crashing, and it doesn't load at all | I've been trying to download the app all week, it keeps giving me an ""Error, app not working right now"" message. Please fix this problem asap, Paramount. | This app sucks. It's super glitchy and crashes all the time. The TV version is even worse Edit: Crashing and being all around glitching isn't an internet or streaming issue. You just need to develop a better app or come up with an update | Well after having this app over a year it now started to give me a lot of problems like for instance everything fine until it starts optimizing and then it stats doing ERROR SORRY THIS VIDEO IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE when clearly I'm watching a TV series which it shouldn't be doing at all there's times I have to restart alot of the times which it shouldn't be happening cuz I do pay for my service | So tired of this streaming service. Been trying to cancel for months. There's no option to cancel ur account by laptop. It's supposed to give you a step by step way to cancel. You follow the steps and it leads you NOWHERE. You try to reach out by email and they ask for your country but doesn't have United States as a option which is a requirement to send your email. They basically force you to keep your account once it's made. Very greedy company. | I don't know if the last update is the problem. But I can't watch anything on the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Dumped the cache. Logged out and back in and nothing has worked! UPDATE: When I did the step by step mentioned. That didn't work either. But now it's back to working! I'm thinking it was something on my end. Who knows? | My overall experience was great until last weekend when I have not been able to download any title. Error message says to wait for current download to finish before adding to the queue. Issue is ther are no current downloads. Please help. | Horrible app, on phone and on PlayStation 5. App continuously glitches. The shows/movies go silent. You have to forward a bit to get audio back and then you get ads. Also if you pause sometimes it stays stuck and can't do anything. You need to close app (ps5) and start over. On phone app rarely wants to load. It freezes. Made sure its all up to date and it is. Just a sh#$y app. | I shouldn't have to watch over 35 commercials to find my spot in a show. That's actually DEEPLY FLAWED. Every time I'm in the wrong place and click back or forward, all of a sudden, I'm watching another 6 commercials. It's completely ridiculous. This time, I pressed a spot & it made me watch 6 commercials, followed by 15 seconds of the show, & THEN to the next 6 commercials?!?!??! Fix your app. Do better. You're falling behind the other streaming services. | Cannot cancel this subscription to save my life, why is it so difficult to cancel? | Use the app all the time but sometimes the app lags before it clears up. Its not the phone or TV because it is only this app that it happens | Knuckles is a awesome show. | Just a bunch of old movies I've seen before. The kids section isn't any better. Nothing NEW. It's totally NOT WORTH THE $$. One of the worse streaming apps I've come across terrible | Keeps crashing | Good 👍 | Horrible, the only way to get an episode to play is to download first. After latest update Chrome cast doesn't work either. Absolutely no issues with Netflix, Amazon Prime, or HBOMax apps. Update 8/23/23: won't open app without internet. 4/25/24 update: still will not open without internet connection. | On my phone I give this app a 5. It works beautifully on my Galaxy;never a problem. On my android TV a 2 and sometimes I get it going right by watching a minute on my galaxy and then going to the TV and hitting resume. On a TV with roku a 4 (a 4 because commercial volume goes up at least 10 settings louder which is very annoying especially if watching the TV with a sleeping child nearby). | Awesome! | You literally pay to watch unskippable long ads. 3 at a time as well. Most free streaming services has these ads and you pay to get rid of them. Better off getting netflix or hulu. | Won't open. For some reason, the app won't open. I have removed it re-downloaded it turned off my phone and nothing. It works fine on my wife's phone and the TV but not on my phone. | I'm canceling my membership at the end of this season of Halo. I want to finish other shows but the commercials are intolerable. | Love the movies | It was working great on my phone, but now it won't let me login on my phone. I'm able to login just fine on my tv and laptop though. I liked being able to watch it in the car. | Great app has improved greatly since I first started using it. Not 5 stars because it still lags every few minutes while I'm on wifi watching a show | Always good movies, love this series of yellowjackets it's a must watch | I cannot get through a single episode without this app freezing. Not worth the money! | Love it❤️ | App can be a little glitchly sometimes randomly shutting down for 'more memory'. Also sometimes will just endlessly load until I unplug the tv and plug ot back in. Once getting past the inconvenience of a glitchy app on my tv the content is great. You get everything from cbs, paramount, and showtime. I've found the shows and movies to be high quality without all the 'filler junk' you see on a service like netflix. Also has full suite of star trek universe all the shows and movies. | I got help quickly. Thanks for fixing my problem! | Crashes to often | I'd give them zero if i could Look forward to still being billed even when you cancel your subscription before the billing date. Then they will refuse to refund you.","{""1"":92680,""2"":24708,""3"":20009,""4"":37381,""5"":207946}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.00 - $139.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","CBS Interactive, Inc.","CBS+Interactive,+Inc.","android-feedback@paramountplus.com","http://www.paramountplus.com","CBS INTERACTIVE, INC.

But every time i go to pay it has an issue | Less than half of there store accept rewards scam | Can't order food on this app! | App still crashes when you try to open past orders. | The app gives you the ability to customize your order to your liking, but only in the app. Once you pick it up, it will just be the basic menu items. Tough luck if you ordered the veg options. | This app used to be functional, especially the rewards program. Since the update, the rewards part keeps freezing not allowing one to access the accumulated rewards. I have three rewards I can't utilize since the app doesn't work and the local store can't do anything with the app. Either fix the rewards system or do a McDs style QR code for rewards . Edit: contacted the email listed below and was informed it was due to an app update. Customer service added about $50 with in free rewards. | Its ok but compared to mcdonalds needs a lot of work. | Always glitches | It's been like 2 or 3 weeks and the app is still broken on the ""pay"" screen. Uninstalled. | What a piece of garbage, spent 10 minutes putting in a big order and then it comes up and tells me something is not available AFTER I click checkout | Doesn't even let me login. Sends me to a website that has annoying popups and then when I hit ""go to app"" it just makes a duplicate page. Since how their app works is flawed, I won't be able to ever login. | Can't order with it anymore so kinda useless now They got it sorted on the ordering | Secret deals! Amazing! 😋 | Don't waste your time. This app is garbage. Feels like you get the bait and switch ...spending all this time customizing orders etc only to find out they silently add on another $5+ dollars when you go to check out.

One of the best fast food apps now! | I will leave a one star review until you add Sweet Tea to your menu on the app! Update: Still no Sweet Tea! 11/04/22 Still waiting for you to add Sweet Tea. | Anyone else remember when Taco Bell was the cheap option? | So far so good I was able to order ahead and they got my order exactly right and they were very polite about it!!

ANNNNNNNND WHO IN THE HELL IS PAYING 2.99 FOR CHIPS AND 🧀 CHEESE? grrrrrr THE SHRINKFLATION IS REAL | Good | So garbage that the in store kiosk doesn't tell you that you don't have a rewards account. Set mine up, and it disappeared. Also, it is not ok for the website to say you can access rewards on the app and website only to have it force you to use the app. Lol, the FAQ page gives an error message stating the URL doesn't exist. No wonder it's a 2.6 rating app. The auto-response didn't understand what was said in the review. It's not a log on issue. Swing and a miss. Lol | Tuesday deals never are applied. Let's you place an order, but you go to pick up and it's not ready because they're missing something, forgot etc. The app seems fine, but results are shaky. Store should compensate but they act like they have nothing to do with the app. | It was all right | Too much trouble | Don't order through the app. It charged me three times, equal $200.25. for my small order. When I called the store, The guy said he couldn't do anything and I should contact the company that owns the app. | Can't use app...says ""uh oh, problem checking out"" when u try to submit order. Needs another update for the update. Other users having same issue | I've been trying to order food from the app for two weeks now. When I go to pay it says there was an error and try again later. Edit it's not a payment issue like you think it is. Other people are having the same freaking issue. Please fix your guy's app!!! | With the most recent update you can no longer track your order or even check past orders. I order regularly through the app, but none of my past orders are showing up nor is my current order showing up tk track. | This is the worst food app out there. So many bugs and errors I don't know where to start. The biggest and probably worst thing about this app is the location. It doesn't detect if you're close to a restaurant or not and there is no option to turn this on. I lost money because of that once. The overall interface is very poorly designed and not very intuitive. Anybody could design a better app. I was able to put lunch items in my basket during breakfast - Error at checkout but didn't tell me why. | Missing items on drive thru order. Was told to call and talk to the corporate office instead of having my food replaced! Love Taco Bell but, I'm a little disappointed in the customer service! | Great, doesn't work half time time but the deals are awesome when it does. | It is impossible to order delivery from this app, which is also the only way to order delivery as the website directs you here. Despite being the only way to order, you cannot order from the app since it refuses you at checkout. | Prices are insane | Disappointed that they want to have app only orders. We didn't have money on a card so we used cash, well they informed us that some items are app only. Taco bell needs to do better | Was working fine, but now it's buggy. My orders don't show up in my orders section of the app so I have no way of tracking them. It also keeps sending my food to an address I used once, even though I changed my delivery location multiple times. | app doesn't work at all just freezes on the pay screen guess I'll never order taco bell delivery sucks to suck | This sucks, whenever I get to the confirm payment screen, it just says, ""unable to confirm order."" I tried to update the app but it doesn't do anything. I tried re-installing, but again, nothing changes. I even tried doing several different payment methods. And yet, it still is clunky and non user friendly. | Love Taco Bell but the app has some serious issues functioning. | I used to use this app all the time. Now every time I try to submit an order, it says there's an issue. I've tried uninstalling and re downloading. I've tried clearing my space on my phone. Nothing works. I now can't use the app at all. Very disappointed. | Checkout is very buggy | Never ever works!!!! Worst food app ever. | Its great but where is the water bottle option | Pointless app. Doesn't work at all. | òiioòI⁹ | Useless pathetic app | Very inconsistent app. There also needs to be an easier way to find contact info or report an issue with incorrect orders/missing items that can be resolved more quickly b/c it happens almost every other order. Also, free delivery should be able to be paired with regular rewards as the rewards are offered by taco bell, and the free delivery is a door dash perk. The customizing options are really nice - but are often not noticed by the employees, so it often results in being overcharged. | This app is terrible. Spent over an hour trying over and over to get the order to go through, only to get stuck when it's time to pay. I'm over it. Your prices are way too high for such low quality food. | Does NOT work at all since updating 🙄 | I love Taco Bell but seriously dislike this app! We ordered dinner on Friday, and were notified(with a photo) that the food had been delivered. As per the picture from the delivery driver, they did not deliver it to my front door. I never received the order, notified the driver and taco bell and never heard from them. We spent over $30 on food we never received, and no response when they were notified. I am not planning to use this app again, guess it's back to Door Dash! | Horribly slow download. Janky and unreliable. | It doesn't allow me to buy food I've tried multiple times it takes the money but says uh oh the app is having issues this needs to be fixed | The app is always down. The worst restaurant app | Shows inaccurate prices on app. Charges your card extra than what is quoted on the app | Was working great was able to have things delivered through it and everything now it won't even let me choose to deliver | Hoodtastic | Won't let me even checkout. Not sure what's wrong, tried closing and reopening the application and still no dice. | Crashes for online orders | Couldn't even make an order without the app bugging out and giving me an error. | This app may tell you something in your order is not available, but not WHAT ITEM isn't available. Unless you put in items one at a time, checking whether the app will take the order, you just have to order in person. | This app has overcharged me twice. Messed up on my scheduled pick-up time for my order. | Still waiting for my free burrito. | This rating might come as a result of the apparently recent update, but I downloaded this application and while it much easier to navigate than other applications, when it came time to submit my order, the application was unable to complete the order, despite all of my information being correct. I tried it multiple times, and my mobile banking informed me I was being charged multiple times, but no dice. 2 stars because after giving up, it turns out I wasn't charged, otherwise 1 star. | If you're gonna have app exclusive deals, the app should work | Love taco bell but this app is the worst idk if it's door dash or something but delivery just don't cause they will either steal your food for something you just won't get it at all for what ever reason just extends time | This app is garbage, it won't let you place an order... update, still never works. App is useless | Wish I could order from the combo restaurants... KFC/Taco Bell. | Doesn't work ever especially when you want to use a promo | Works 5% of the time, most of the time whenever I try to checkout, it just gives me am error or just loads indefinitely | The app is okay; will always have its years-long occasional bugs. I feel there's nothing holding TB back from adding more customizing. The biggest issue is the pricing has recently gone way out of hand and I've reached a point where I can order takeout combos from local Mexican restaurants for less and receive a much higher quality product. I feel this has to be choking out the franchises unless they are still making enough with the higher margins on fewer customers. TB can see I order less. | Money thiefs and Terrible bad designed app that can't even refund you | Charges me then... oh no.. Can't process order. Shows up on my account... Over $300 ordered in last 30days I've been very upset about quality when it...Comes to extra, cheese, chicken, sauce ..I pay double but end up with a regular cantina taco, or half of normal amount Rare to get what I ordered. But it's so good I keep trying, at $40+ per order | App has died again, each time i try to check out it gives the ""Uh oh, our app has died"" message. Two calls to their 1-800 number has accomplished nothing. App pushed a notification 30 min ago, but upon opening the app it just changes the color scheme of the bell and never opens, let it go for 10 min, never opened, tried several times, turned phone off/on, still just the color changing bell. No, I did not uninstall/reinstall as it's a pain in the a$$ to enter all my in | Desperately needs a scanning option to pay in store. My card got stolen and now I can't order in the app, so you're losing business daily until my new card arrives. | Fix your app it didn't add half my order | Wheres the free item that they advertise to download this app... | App works fine now | Can't order what I want. Options are too limited. | Hadn't worked in months | This app has been great for a while but I can't get into the favorites menu without the app crashing. This has been a problem for months now with no help or word back from the support team. I barely get taco bell anymore because I don't want to keep remaking favorites of mine every single time I open the app. Long story short. The app is good but having to customize the same food every single time is real annoying and I hate it | Clean class A and personal are courtesy and welcome you to their place we recommend | The update to the app is a complete failure. It no longer allows me to set a default payment method such as Google Pay. Plus it now does not respond correctly after payment and goes back to telling me I have to pay. Causing me to now pay for it twice and get double orders and there's nothing the store could do about it. This is very upsetting. No need for me share more. I work near TB and go there almost daily, sometimes more, and the app is a hot mess after the update. UGH! Will update if fixed | Very time I check out and finished my order It pops up say sorry something went wrong having trouble signing in. Because there is a red circle just going and going and going around none stop. | Poor app, have not been able to place a single order. Constantly saying there's a problem with the items in my cart. Also tried to order breakfast at 8:30 am and had a pop up saying breakfast was not available at this time. | Let's you order and notify but will not let you check out..was scared to keep trying because I wasn't sure if it was still charging me .. | For over a year this app hasn't worked for me. I've updated it, removed it from my apps and re-downloaded the app and when I do get to the point where I can send my order to the restaurant it says ""oops, there are problems with our severs"" and won't send in my order. This app is basically pointless. It's hard for me to believe they are fixing these issues | Since it will not allow me to check out, I will spend my money elsewhere . | It's taco bell mmmm | We have used the app quite a few times. Always has issues connecting and not at all reliable!!!! You can't get ahold of anyone if your food isn't delivered! 55$ down the drain because it never came. This isn't even the first time. Just save your time and money and use doordash | Subtotal changes when checking out. Prices are misleading. | Uninstalling since it refuses to accept any of my forms of payment. Claims to accept VISA & MASTER CARD but I keep receiving errors. Due to this issue I have to order in person therefore I don't get my points since I can't upload a receipt. Pointless reward system that never works. Also rewards are never able to be redeemed. I have qualifying item in cart & at checkout it says I don't. Waste of time | It's actually impossible to checkout in this app. It just spins perpetually. Terrible. | ⁶it05 put | The order experience is pretty smooth and straightforward (even with the random Something Went Wrong messages, I can usually find a way around that). It would be nice to be able to cancel my order without having to uninstall, log into your website, cancel my order and then reinstall the app. | The app has been buggy and glitchy for years now, ever since the Mexican pizza came back. But for the last few months I literally have not been able to get the app to open successfully. I've reinstalled several times and nothing works.","{""1"":83353,""2"":13859,""3"":10465,""4"":12123,""5"":52510}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Taco Bell Mobile","Taco+Bell+Mobile","DigitalSupport@tacobell.com","http://www.tacobell.com","1 Glen Bell Way

There is far better and cheaper sites. | I like it is so good | downloads don't work when outline | App is very glitchy. | it is the best app ever and it is goated | Great product, 👍 👌 👍 👌always something new to watch and learn stuff. | I'm not going to keep paying my earned money on a streaming service that doesn't stream! I don't care where I'm at in this country as a driver. I should be able to watch whenever I want! You all make lots of money off of people for your app not to stream!!! If YouTube can play through anything, why can't you all???!!! | amazinggggggggggg | I LOVE DISNEY PLUS ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS FREE FOR 6 MONTHS.. THANK YOU VERIZON 😊 | Love to watch marvel | AMAZING NOT AS MANY ADS I LOVE IT:) | Not telling anyone you're going to ban them for sharing their accounts and then giving them no access to sign out. Sounds like something Walt put into play. | well laid out and very use friendly. | Not enough options. | Well... I'm out. Going up with prices again and again. Especially when you see that Switzerland has the highest prices in the world already for the same offer like every other country. App is pretty basic, would've loved to see a ""watched"" tag on things I've already seen. | terrible | good | Good app just don't watch enough | I am the fan of the moon on my phone and since I was just reading the poster I was just reading the other products and I was happy with it's and was impressed with your service and the app here and it was still fine for me to get from chromebook recovery | Absolutely recommended I had Netflix for a while and I pretty much watched every thing so I got Disney plus and there is so much movies on there Freaky Friday, Big hero city, Tangled, Mrs Doubtfire and sooooooooooooo much more 5 fricken stars 🌟 to you Disney plus!!!!! | nice | too many bugs, feed is slow | Okay | Great Great | PS5 app tells me to go to the website, website asks for a code, I enter the code, it tells to me download the android app, I download the android app, it says nothing about connecting to the PS5. Disney clearly doesn't have enough money to build a functioning log in system | very good experience | It is the best day ever. | Really miss the A-Z search option! Sometimes I don't always want to watch what the app is suggestioning and just scroll everything. This feature was removed on the last update. Bring it back!!! | too buggy | I find it funny yal deleted my review my Uninstall and cancel everything show are not everything after all | Wel op smartphone maar o laptop niet eens bereikbaar of de app te installeren | soooo good lots of movie options and tv shows | good.... | My Disney will not work at all | Nothing to watch but the woke... It's just a propaganda machine and the only new movies/tv shows that they make are rehashes with people of a different color. Lazy with no imagination. | Consistently freezes and has error messages... it's not my internet because other apps work just fine .... It's been months.. fix it if you're going to keep upping the price!! | 🤷‍♀️ | Just got disney+ and this app is terrible. Paying money and it hardly works.Can't clear continue watching,keeps restarting movie or show no matter where I stop it. Is very jumpy and not really user friendly. Cmon fix these things. | Completely unusable We recently got the Disney/Hulu bundle but have come to learn that the Disney+ app is essentially unusable. We are trying to steam Bluey though our Chromecast and the show will frequently buffer for 30-45 seconds, and then usually a minute or two later it will completely fail and disconnect from the Chromecast. This is supremely frustrating for my children and they already know that we can't watch Disney shows because ""Disney doesn't work"" | Great content but the download feature is horrendous. Baffles me how such a large company is skimping out on competent app developers. I travel away with work so I need to download my content and it rarely works and if it does it's so slow like it's recieving next to no data and that's on WiFi or standard 4g. Looking at the other reviews it's clear I'm not the only one with this problem. Come on Disney, pull your finger out and get it sorted especially since you have the cheek to charge me more. | Double charge on app & Hulu app & still no access to movies very disappointed | Very slow and spend more time watching it buffer than watch movies or TV shows and my broadband speed is good need to sort this out or will stop paying | Friday night after a week of horror, we're watching a movie and decide to go back to the show we're on episode 5 of. The set top box gives an error. I quit the app, opened it again, error. I log out and login, still error. I check on the phone, it works. I check on my laptop, it works. I uninstall the app from the set top box. I put it. Bag password: wrong password. I check the password, it's the one entered. I put it back. mistake, mistake. I'm asking for a code. says wrong code !!! | it glitches but good | All the movies are great but it won't work all the time for me. very slow to load. | always a 5-star for Disney | Very buggy and unreliable. Plenty of errors that make no sense. Casting is touch and go. It's disappointing | Easily overloads and stops working. Error code 76/41 | DOESN'T WORK ON PHONE OR SMART TV SINCE TODAY, ERROR 41 ....what the hell!! | not working | sorry something went wrong. so i just stop my subscription. | No support for slovakia, often doesnt work | Won't let me even log in! Still errors 14 and 92. In 2024: error 41, can't play any content | Nothing workes in the update. | awful, AWFUL. | Dolby Atmos broken again, seems an update has killed atmos again.... Amazon fire stick | O EE was eew f you york was you | It's not working | Terrible lately, error code 40,41,70 changes every time I try to watch something, absolute shambles | Everything is wonderful. Kids and I really enjoy it. | Kinda weird how most of my favourite entertainment properties have been gobbled up by Disney over the last few years. I'm not complaining ... on the contrary, now everything's on this one ""channel"" so I'm saving tons of dough 🤓😁 | great app | When watching serieses the episodes tend to play in the wrong order. Eg i will watch S3 E10 then the next episode will jump back to S2 E8 even though I have already watched that. This is very annoying and seems to be made worse by downloads, even though I delete watched episodes | seriously why can't I subscribe to it not only on the app but on the website what's up with that | App works great. Now if Disney would just teach Paramount Plus how to create an app. | Great content, from Marvel, Star Wars and Disney Classics. | Great | Able to install but can't log in no matter what I try. | it's impossible to update | Doesn't remember what I'm watching or how much I watched | constantly saying slow internet. did a speed check and I have 600+ upload and 100+ download. | awesome | this channel is the best | Impeccable service rendered; thank you! | weird errors All the time permitting playback. | Amazing movies to watch | The worst streaming app, for a big corporation like Disney to not be able to to better than this is super disapointing. | After login, I get a message that I am not subscribed. That is correct. There is however not an option to, ehm, well, subscribe! | Some of the best content available but the app is terrible and glitchy. Has trouble marking episodes as finished, if you rewind too far after pausing an episode the episode playing fails | Very difficult to cancel or even resubscribe. Why are ypu making it harder to take my money? | Doesn't work anymore on my tablet. Canceling my subscription 😡 | Content is great, but app is just ""ok"". App is missing key user interface that other streaming apps have to make it easier to navigate. 1) watching foreign TV series you can't select in settings language... instead all the episodes are repeated 2 & 3 times --you have to keep finding the episode with the language you want 2) even after you find a language you want the auto play doesn't know how to handle all the repeat episodes and will jump either back to the beginning (losing your spot) etc | Good | love it | The worst | poor new content often no audio dub English. in the new world too busy to read subtitles especially when driving. Dumb login. I have heaps of devices. Chucks a spaz. | No sound in the app | I would definitely slow down to spit on disney. Don't want those in charge to miss a drop! | won't update won't open | I never get to finish an episode before it automatically switches to the next one. I have to back all the way out and go back to the one I was one. This is a consistent issue. | Superb content has been a delight getting all the star wars done in timeline order | Disny+ | Yet another price increase of 20%. I wouldn't mind so much if disney/marvel etc would put out some decent content. Their output over the past few years has been dismal. Not worth the money now. Cancelling. | Why are you guys not putting out any new seasons? It's been over 2 years on some of these shows?

Also what happen to shuffle button? I really loved shuffling all my stations! Please bring back the shuffle button! | Dont listen to comedy and music. RADIO app with VIDEO ads. Like youtube, but the ads cause motor accidents. Like when a song has sirens, but you crash your car while trying to change the song. Like when tesla self driving cars crash. Its not the fault of the radio app you crashed while waiting for a video ad to finish, its your fault for wanting radio over watching a movie while driving. Pandora is like payimg full price for netflix, but only getting audio outside the ads. Dont listen to | Coins Moeny | Very good app | Get off! | Since update freezes and will not respond to skips or even trun off sometimes | When will the add variety be back up? | Love the app | 🤩🥰🤐thank you ! | This week I've noticed that when I open an individual station to add more artists to it, this gray, completely blank screen comes on and doesn't allow any options or anything to tap on. I have to tap the backwards button to go back to the previous screen. So, at this time, I'm unable to add additional artists to any of my stations or delete any previous thumbed up songs. Could this be a bug in the app or does it sound more like something with my individual account? | I go to add variety and it just goes to a grey screen. This has been happening for a month now | I'm having problems w offline and wifi mode!! I can't skip songs after skipping several, then it freezes and I have to close it. I try to play a diff song but it plays both songs at same time! So I have to close it and reopen it!! Please fix it as it has already updated!! | A good app. Only thing I dislike is the Bluetooth popups. Constant popups, complaining that I absolutely need to enable bluetooth permissions. It's annoying, at least make it less spammy. | LOVE 💖 sending this to countries that don't have radio like Iceland 🇮🇸 | I've used this service and this application for many years. It has almost completely stopped casting to my Chromecast device, and the service does not connect with my smart TV. If I didn't use it while driving, I'd drop the service entirely. Y'all need to update your connectivity protocols. | Great app with great music would recommend to any music lover🙂 | Offline station download does not work as well as when you close app it reopens it self in your phone task bar?? Has been happening for almost a year now on different phones so it's a Pandora problem. | Repeats same songs not are in the genre | PANDORA IS AN AWESOME APP LIKE NO OTHER BEEN USING PANDORA FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF ITS INCEPTION I JUST BUT ON SEARCH MY FAVORITE SONG OR ARTIST & I LET RUN NONE STOP & I'VE MADE AN ARTIST LIST & BESIDES THE ARTIST SONGS IT PLAYS CONTEMPORARY OTHER ARTISTS SONGS AS WELL. I WOULDN'T CHARGE PANDORA FOR ANY OTHER | Your app still isn't working correctly. Once again your app still isn't working and the session when trying to listen keeps timing out | New update has ruined this app. You go to skip a song or do litterally anything on the app it 9/10 times just sits there looking at you like you just hopped on the short bus and started gave them a pop quiz. Complete and utter dog sh**. | Mr gusto mucho El uso de esta app.No me molestaron los anunsios y Creo que me cayo muy bien.🧡 | Too many commercials | Since the Oct update, it keeps freezing, not letting me change songs or stations. There was another update this month (Mar 2024) and the same issue persists. How are you going to justify charging us another $1/month if you can't even fix the issues? I used to love this app. 🙄 | I can make my own Playlist and listen to any kind of tunes I want to it's fabulous | I'm downloaded it years ago just downloaded it now I don't have time to experience what's going on with it | Fix your app before you start charging more. | App is super glitchy, and now they want more money. How about fixing the bugs . Im reasy to switch to another music app at this point. So, instead of them fixing their app, they want me to troubleshoot the problem . I pay them, and i have to fix the problem ? What a joke | Great | Excellent streaming service! | plays maybe 2 songs then u have to restart it. :( Now as of 4/24 I can't even use it without getting a error and it just shuts down. | just canceled my subscription after over a decade of use. crashes non stop. music won't stop playing. just a mess. sad but aint worth ten bucks a month anymore. | Kinda funny that there is absolutely no issue with pandora taking my monthly payment, yet the issues we have all complained about for MONTHS are still occurring (unable to skip or pause, having to force close constantly, 2 songs playing at once). And yes, I have tried all the trouble shooting steps. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. I have even emailed support. But hey, at least you guys are making your money. Please fix these issues. | It's not bad but no matter what station I choose to listen to, there's more Chris Stapleton songs than anything else. Their algorithm loves Stapleton. Matter of fact, just got an alert on my phone for Chris Stapleton... I have never listened to his station. Didn't even know any of his songs until I started using this app. It's out of control | Updated and now I can't add variety, icon does not appear for quick access, forced to scroll through recently used apps to access and doesn't show current song sometimes. | I've used pandora for years! The last few months? SO many issues. Shutting off, refusing ro shut off when I try, starting songs over top one another. Just a mess. If this continues I may have to switch to Spotify. I'd be sad to lose all my music. But this is getting ridiculous | I'll start playing a Playlist then I want to pause my music and I can't. The only way to stop it from playing is to close that tab. When I open the app music is playing but the play button isn't active, it's like it's paused, but it is not. | Great music. | Pandora fails to yield to the pause signal when another audio stream starts. For example, it continues playing over navigation instructions instead of pausing. | Been using for like 8 years I like I lt better then other music apps | Hmmm... having the same problem as many. Blank screen when I try to add variety (to build my station). Seems Pandora hasn't been willing to fix it for weeks. Emailed them directly, and still no response. They must be awfully busy adjusting their billing software for our increased rates. | Won't let me add artists to my created stations. | I love my Pandora | Over Bluetooth, every new song plays at a very low volume until I pause and resume, except commercials, of course. The app will start playing music through the phone at some random time after Bluetooth is disconnected. | I've been using this app for years, and pay monthly for it. it's not been working well at all for me last few months. playing the same songs over and over when in offline mode, and in regular mode won't let me skip or thumps down. I've been contemplating canceling and switching to something better. editing: none of what you said to do to get this to work was even applicable. even leaving this review has been a pain. | I can finally figure this out, this won't help me, I can never send my favorite on the on this it's my own song, Cameron wah, go a wah hello, welcome love camera, Kevin locker room, you know the sound I made, please feel. | I've enjoyed the app for almost a decade of my life, and it's worked pretty great. We have premium and everything. But recently, no matter what I do, the 'add variety' feature on stations just leads me to a flat grey screen with no option to search for music or artists to add. It's gotten rather fond of using that feature, and it's frustrating to me. Please can you find a way to address this issue? | Pandora. Is not worth it? Got the premium package. Do not get it, do not waste your time or money on it. The people at Pandora do not care about their product. They just don't care. Don't spend the money Pandora management an IT people really suck they don't know what they're doing they are just money grubbing people they don't want to help you they won't they want money that's all it's not worth it | Messes up every single day!!!!!!!!! So frustrating. | This app has been crashing like crazy. I've been using this (and PAYING for it) for years. Fix this. It is so frustrating 😤 😫 UPDATED REVIEW: Now we are going to have to pay more while still having all the b[!!$hit still happening. | Can not create separate stations aways plays all thumbed songs in all stations very irritating when I want a specific type of music as I enjoy almost all types just not at all times definitely looking in amazon music and Spotify | This app has gone down hill significantly over the years. Between music randomly stopping and now I'm having issues adding variety to a certain station.... Just get a gray screen no matter how long you sit at that screen. | Amazing life changeing | Have used for years, but every time they do an ""update,"" it gets more and more glitchier. | Why is there a limit you don't need more money this app sucks | Pandora, I would say, is a 5 star app. But could you please suggest an option that is not just thumbs up but is also a heart. | It's ridiculous how we now have to pay 11 something dollars (a dollar more) for ""premium"" and it's nothing but issues. When I want to quit the app and go to another one that requires sound, it won't shut off or automatically mute for the transition. I literally have to close the entire app and sometimes that does even work. Have to go to the settings and force close. Plus the sound quality is terrible (bc the app is terrible) when played through a speaker. I know it's not my speaker lol. PLEAS | Recently reinstalled & after closing the app it auto opens and has to closed again & again 4/26/24 would give 0 stars | Bugs and glitches are the norm for this app anymore. I used to love it but it's more of a pain than anything anymore. Before you say troubleshoot, already did and hasn't changed a thing. Now the price is going up for garbage? Time to stop paying for junk. So you give me a link to troubleshoot which I told you I already did. Garbage app and apparently garbage support | It's just starting to suck again, so work on an update. It still sucks and I have premium. Jesus! Smfh Still no updates! Hurry up sheesh | Please fix Pandora!!! Been broken for 3 months. The following features are now broken: autoplay of similar songs, switching between BT devices, playlists I made are missing, control vuttons grey out after switching devices, keeps playing after turning off BT device. Works worse. | I'm tired of hearing the same songs. It's getting worse, most of the time the song is played out. When others plays their Pandora I be jamming so it should be the same on mines. Thank you for playing less lil baby though. | Been a long time pandora user, since 2008ish. Subscribed for probably 8-10 years now. Recently received an email saying my subscription was increasing from $9.99 to $10.99. Felt bad enough when it jumped from $3.99 to $6.99 and then to $9.99. I just can't justify the continuing cost increases of every service. Time to dust off the old iPod classic. | Been in love w Pandora since 2009 and don't typically use other music apps but the bugs are driving me crazy. You removed the alarm clock feature a few years ago, but my pandora still starts on its own every morning at 530a and I'm not able to stop or change it. On top of that the app won't stop playing when you try, have to force close the app to get it to stop (hate). Also have only ever had 1 account but my premium is listed under 2 different Gmail accounts neither will let me make changes. | Won't stop auto opening and playing songs. Cleaned cache, forced stop, checked for auto start, uninstalled and reinstalled. Keeps loading itself and playing songs. KILLS my battery and drains my data. Ive been with Pandora for years, but this is too much. Let's see if Spotify has nose dived like Pandora. | App still freezes when trying to skip songs while in my car. Have to completely shut down and reset app to get it to work again. Has been like this for the last 4 months. Pandora should refund all there premium members for all the on going problems it is having. Extremely unhappy with the service and will be canceling if they don't get this fixed. Ok I did all your trouble shooting steps and called for assistance. Still does not work. Your turn to fix the app now or start giving refunds.... | Very positive experience for me | Any time I listen to music for more than 30min, without fail will bug out. I go to pause, will keep playing, try to skip/choose another song and it will play it over the current one. Getting more annoying than how spotify was. | Pandora use to be my one and only music app but now Spotify isnt sounding to bad. App stays running after closing it, and will stop playing music randomly. | Paying for a subscription and can't skip or even pause...wth??? Never thought I'd ever hate Pandora... | Not much selection and they play the same songs all the time over and over you can not fast forward past an intro and the whole app needs a reset. Not happy about Pandora and I might stop payment. | A1~◇¡¡!!+++++$$$$$ | I can't get into it | It works | It's unresponsive alot | For the last year I can't change songs, pause, skip forward without closing the app. I'm giving this one more month. And I'm moving platforms. No. Troubleshooting helped and their customer support, well there isn't any....tired of this. | Won't let me add variety to stations. The app always closes out and is always running, so I have to force stop the app | App WAS good, now it's a headache. Tried all trouble shooting. I can't skip, pause, or disconnect from my car without the music playing in my pocket, with the only way to stop it is to close the app. Now they have the nerve to raise the price. Wow Really 👌🏾 | Been listening and paying for years and now u guys can't fix it from stop playing. Skipping songs and you want to rasie price, I'm about to ended subscription | broken add variety button when editing stations | Has bug and glitches that don't go away and Spotify glitches get resolved, And now the price is going up Spotify it is. | When i tell you i love pandora there music is amazing i have never had a problem with not find music. | DATS MY THING RIGHT THERE. | Charging more money for unresolved issues is insane!!! I've contacted customer service and even tried the ""workaround"" that they are leaving in the reviews and Pandora STILL isn't working correctly. I pay for premium service but I can't skip or even pause songs because the icons get greyed out. Might have to switch to their competitor | Awesome | Good alternative to the radio.û | Been great for years until this year when the app keeps playing after I turn my car off and the pause button doesn't work half the time so I have to close the whole app | 👍 | It keeps crashing or stops working all the time. I've uninstalled it multiple times and it keeps doing it. Either they fix it or I'll be canceling my subscription. Update, I did. It's still doing it. | The app constantly fails. Sometimes I won't play. Other times it locks the controls so you can't pause or skip a song. And today it's more broken than ever. The very day they announced they'd be raising prices. Every review in here is complaining about the same issues and Pandora refuses to fix them. Instead they just respond to every review telling users to waste their time going through pointless troubleshooting steps. | I couldn't tell the difference between free and 5.99. Then it stopped working. | Great👍 | Lol. User tried deleting my review because can't handle the truth. Pandora SUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!!!! Glitchy trash!!!!!! Crashes and glitches all the time! I'll be checking back often 👋 | When I change the song it keeps playing over the previous one, I have to constantly close the app and reopen. | I love this app, but right now, after I close it, it reopens and runs in the background when I'm not using it. This just kills my data. This has been going on for months now. I was going it was just a temporary issue, it doesn't seem to be. | 2 years ago I left a review about how much this app sucks. It seems it's only gotten worse. So much for all those ""we'll get it fixed"" replies the devs had for everyone. Please do us all a favor and do away with pandora completely while you still have a tiny shred of dignity from when you actually was a decent app. | App is total garbage now. Worked good for years, now is a total mess, can't pause, forward, stops working randomly. Submit support tickets and nothing happens bit they sure keep taking their money every month, and now they're gonna raise prices. Their troubleshooting steps don't solve anything, had these issues last November, you'd think they'd be able to fix something by now, but judging by the other reviews, they can't. | Greatest | The app is constantly messing up to where I can't change songs anytime I unhook it from Bluetooth it keeps playing until I shut the app down completely and I lose my place in the playlist it's been doing this for months it's getting freaking ridiculous if they can't get this fixed I'm switching to Spotify | App keeps going ""grey"" with skip and anything else locked until I fully close out the app and restart it and I pay for it , gonna cancel soon if this bug/issue or whatever it is doesn't get fixed soon. 👎👎👎👎 Update it is April 4th ,2024 and the app still constantly freezes and needs closed and reopened to skip or pause songs. App is going downhill .

My wife Lisa is Bonjovi #1 Fan! | family guy and jojo's coexisting should be illegal and I love it | Great app! | so far so good. let me spend more time. I'll definitely keep you posted. | Hulu stopped working on my philips tv can't get it to play anything. Wish the live tv was true as I watch pro wrestling, which comes on at 8pm eastern time, which is 5pm for me, so I am always 3 hours let to the show | Should not be this difficult to change plans | here's the thing... this is dumb. | You really need to be able to manually choose the quality because I'm so sick of watching literally everything in 360p | This app freezes on the live and closes its self out CONSTANTLY!!! If you want sports/ live TV, Fubo is better. | it keeps signing me out it's very annoying. in the continue watching should be at the top | too many adds | It makes u have location on I get approximate location but precise no u say for streaming but h never deeded it when there wasn't a option so y need it now and y even give a opinion might as well put let us or delete 🖕🫏 | laggy | Terrible watching experience as a sports fan. Some games I have to watch thru my phone because HuluLive on my Roku TV gives me an error code if I try to start from the beginning while it is recording. Other games I can't record live at all, only the later replay. Tonight with the draft, I got home a couple hours in and tried to start it from the top and can't. Start from beginning button won't work, spent 10 minutes rewinding all the way to the beginning. | Love this. | need to allow away from home .. live tv.. ie.. property away from home area | terrible garbage | Sucks. Can't stream anything! | I cant get into the Hulu it says it will send a code and the code doesn't work!!!!! | possibly anything you could watch, has everything, 5/5. | I've been using it for years and I still can never figure out how to get from a video to the episodes list on my phone. it's annoying pretty much every time I use it on here. I was just in the midst of tripping over myself trying to figure it out and being brought back to my homepage when it offered me the opportunity to leave this review. it was fotuitously timed. thanks hulu. | I Love Hulu. | Why pay for a subscription service and still have to watch ads? Can't wait to be done with Shogun. | Constantly logs out. I have to log in every time I open the app. Extremely inconvenient. | can't cast to my tv | all kinds of great shows and movies. one of my favorite movie apps. | xfinity update and lost kdka | I love the selection of old classics and also the new content from Hulu is pretty good too. | Crashes every single time I've used it. EVERY SINGLE TIME! | I tried to watch Hulu, but I don't have access to the email.i.opened my account with many years ago. FORGET IT | always logs me out, this is only a problem on android | nice | I love it!! | Love using Hulu; Never have any.problems with access! | i love HuLu | Overall, hulu has so many UI problems. It freezes, can't keep track of where you are, it will skip episodes and start in weird places. If you pause for a few minutes, it might or might not start back at the same place. | The app keeps freezing every few seconds to every minute or so, I can't watch anything. There are several reviews here saying the same. We are going to quit paying for the service if this doesn't get resolved and very soon. Why would we pay for something that we literally can't use? | perfect! | great Quality | The only streaming app I use that randomly stops...often! | your now requiring me to sign-in on my tv for viewing. I normally watch HULU on my TV, went to watch today and can only view on my phone. It's the same freaking account! PLUS, your content glitches constantly! No wonder no one can compete with Netflix. *casting from one device to the next shouldn't be so difficult H.U.L.U. | F@#$ing sick of this app signing me out and deleting all of my downloads. I travel for work nearly every week, and without fail this garbage app signs me out halfway through my trip and deletes all my downloads while I'm traveling, leaving me without entertainment. About ready to cancel my hulu subscription and sail the high seas again, ridiculous nonsense. Figure out what is going wrong hulu or I'm gone. | excessive commercials | the inability to use local news at remote locations makes this a less than desirable app | Every time I open the app I have to enter my password and email to reactivate my account, extremely annoying and the layout is bad and the search is doesn't give good results | great 💯 | Used to be great. Now it logs me out for no reason once a month and won't let me back in until I reset my password. Such advanced technology. So relaxing and wonderful. | hate the ads | green out | good to watch movies on and a great app for family nights | Don't both paying for ""commercial free"".... you will still have to watch commercials. | Can't work outside the USA. Hulu was my favorite app to use. | App is good but there is no option to view offline, like while long flights. | hulu doesnt provide a video or movie | Why can't Hulu get it through their head my time that I pay for a service is not for you to resell for commercials I will never watch commercials you cannot make me and I will not watch them. | to many commercials with the regular subscription 😕 | more older movies need to be played like fame both years dream girls and also other saga like burlesque | The worst tv app ever, forever crashing and glitching, as soon as the NBA finals are over so is hulu, as much as they keep raising the prices, they should raise their app game to many ads for 77.00ba month to be crashing and glitching get it together hulu!!! | excellent | its great | Horrible UI, only app worst is the Hulo on Roku.. absolutely terrible interface | Occasionally resets the ad timer without any reason | I love it. The movies you can watch on here are amazing 👏! | A Loyal subscriber for years now, enjoying all the various selections of movies and entertainment to the fullest - maybe a bit more then Netflix's. | Too much money more than cable and internet | a bit to many ads | hate the commercials | dumb | Enjoyable | too many adds | terrible flow when trying to use | I extremely love watching movies and TV shows on Hulu but I have trouble paying my bill OK Monroe Stewart thank you? | great streaming service | All I can say is that it's good. Runs my movies and shows very well. | hitting the back button causes the app to freeze | Hulu has a lot of options, just wish they would quit raising prices. | BingeBoldBeautyHuluBabe🥰 | Should get a refund when you guys release two of your most popular shows in the months where the show is constantly interrupted on-air. You'd be lucky if you get one episode of Good Doctor and one Episode of The Rookie per month. Just drop the episodes on streaming anyways, why is it that just because it can't air on CBS (people who pay for cable) then people who pay for Hulu can't watch it either??? | not working | Too many ads for a paid service | app freezes alot | like it got good movies always have liked Hulu. thank you | it has a few of my favorite shows | I love boom Sonic | can't wait to watch this! | nicely done | Too many friggin commercials! | Ads are way to often. They alone could make this free with ads. Paying and this many ads is a greedy insult. Once I cancel I wont come back. Plenty of ways to watch any of this for free. Ridiculous is the word Im using. | awesome | hate surveys | I have a account. Tried to login and it won't let. What the hell happened | I really like Hulu and their movie and TV show selections I just don't like the price of the no ads subscription | Don't bother subscribing. They slowly take away content and make you upgrade to see what you originally paid for. This is bait and switch. | I was baited in for repeats than ask $90 for the real thing, I should have known with Xfinity attached. more bait and switch. I had to remove your app. You are over writing all apps without permission. | I keep getting logged out | I love using hulu for downloading videos. When it works, it's great, but I often find that whenever I leave my house and come back I get logged out of hulu on my phone, which deletes all my downloads and then I have to download them again. This has been happening more recently, and it it very bothersome because it keeps happening everyday.

Mostly because the channels frezze at times and also some channels have some kind of repeat action on some channels It makes it hard to like the programs very much. So your system is one of the lowest rated streaming systems to watch. I hope it can be fixed because good thing it is a free service. And if your going to add new channels make sure they don't skip and repeat the dialogue at times when you add new channels. | This amazing free movies and TV shows 😍😍👍💯 | Horrible programming problems! | All your classic tv, in one spot. | 😊 | Haven't used it enough to make an opinion. | The most annoying app ever.

Used to but stopped. Android s22 | Really good and understandable app | it is a good app for when you lose your Roku | onsite interview in the battlefield | remote control use is easy and nice. | oh yeah 👍 | having a terrible time picking up on my tablet. | Good app | Great app. use it nightly. no flaws or hiccups. | This is the app that works best for me I have been using this for over 2 years now. | great app. | Love da app | Nifty if u can't find the damn remote but takes forever to load up. If u need to quickly turn down ur TV it be better to use the remote by the time this app loads ur whole neighborhood heard the commercials . Oh and also when TV been off too long u can't turn it back on with the app . I also wish I could control my kids TV without being in the same room. That be cool | I can't even open the app. I click on the icon but the app doesn't want to open. | amazing app 👏 👌 🙌 nuff said | The app no longer recognizes my LEGIT Roku Stick Plus. | good | Such a cool app | Good | Awesome app. Loving Roku for my entertainment. 😊 | just purchased a Roku smart t v so will need some time before I make a review. Have a Roku Express 4k and am very satisfied with it. | Bean ja wakka!!! | the best | very good selection. | soo much better than xfinity. | Not too bad | 👌 | It's only Glichty sometimes | Asked me to review and for 35 permissions before I even opened the app. Heres your review, i hate you | Very good app except you need very high Wi-Fi 😞 and I'm poor p | useful good for tv | I cannot cast to my older Roku 4230X devices - And they still work just fine. Also, I was forced to upgrade from my earlier app version v6.3. Why? It was working fine too. Too bad Roku - No soup for you. | it's very good | great alternative to cable | 👍 | Works ok. the Roku control stopped working after 4 years | Roku has everything I need. | I LOVE this app❤️ | so easy and ultra convenient to use | the fact that I can log in to any TV using an app is priceless! | Great option. | awesome service and tv option | I am really enjoying my Roku streaming | awesome tv | Only problem I have is the app randomly stops letting me connect to my device and I have to close the app , reconnect to the wifi and then it connects just a little tedious it wasn't doing this before to which is odd it just randomly started doing it | it's great | good quality | nice | It's a very good app for free. | Nothing I like it | Works for me... | at times it doesn't recognize my roku tv even though it's on the same wifi. apart from that everything is very good | great | Great app (remote control) | good stuff 👏 | When i save a movie or show thru the app, it doesn't show on the ""What to Watch Save List"" when i open it on the tv. It used to show before. | Works perfectly where Kids lose the remote | I LOVE IT SO MUCH WHEN I LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL I CAN ALWAYS USE MY PHONE | absolutely useless. audio steam to phone cuts out after a few minutes and needs to be reconnected over and over. totally pointless. | i love my Roku tv and this app is awesome. | very easy n fast link up | Roku has disappointed at every turn. Very unreliable hardware and constant software issues. | Good stuff 🤌🏻 | love Roku thanks for your help | Won't. Stop. Loading. Nothing fixes it and it's now virtually Useless. | great app | I just been normal. | roku is great has some good tv shows and local chanels and good movies. | Awesome | Arbitration clause terms and conditions update is awful but not accepting means throwing away the money I paid for the TV since I could not use it otherwise | there is just so so many streaming channels and you can connect your DVD player to Roku remote I mean the more you search and do things with it the more you find you can do | EDIT: 4/20/24 My last rating was 5 stars this app worked perfectly. But this last update, is buggy and won't work or connect. | works great | Sucks | requested a rating upon first starting the app. that is just retarded | cool | Works most of the time. When I use headphones though sometimes the audio randomly cuts out and the only way to fix it is to reinstall the app | Boooooo Bring back the search function | Good features and things 😉 | absolutely love it | good 😊 | Great selection offered by Roku. | great app for when you don't have remotes for your Roku tv | The remot itself works well. However the main reason I got this app was to use headphone mode unfortunately it often times cuts out... In order to fix this according to the suggestions on the app I have to give permision to microphone and camera? That's seems unlikely to me I don't see what either of those have to do with the literal sound but it's definitely something that needs to be fixed. | Its a curse it stays on ur TV when u got rid of it 1 star | love the phone app. works just like a regular remote and I don't have to buy batteries. | This app works but. This has adds every 10 seconds to work thwn back to an immediate ad. | the best app I ever used | This app worked great for the last 2+ years. But all of a sudden, it is no longer connecting to my device. I have tried un and reinstalling the app, verified that the wifi connection isn't the issue, and I even tried manually connecting the app via the IP address to no avail. | ugh I don't need this app | because | very helpful if you were to lose your remote | the app has started giving me notifications about useless shows and such that I care absolutely nothing about | Randomly disconnects after 20 or so minutes of not using it. Basically after the avg YouTube video you have to reconnect your remote.

I got told about it. I've been checking it out and I guess it's a lot even a lot better than TikTok. | been a few days I've had an account good so far | It's an awesome app! I downloaded it in 2020! It was mostly about politics, and then it gradually became more popular because of newbies and their respect for the apps morals. 2023 is a whole other story! However, this is still a great platform to use! | Bad as far using it for first time it didn't seem to function correctly at all but it seems to work right now 3 days later probably because it prompts you to do these things and that's not what I did apparently. | Fun and easy to use | Very good experience | needs more users | I'm really loving it,I have a lot of friends I told are coming hear they are good at what they do. | It's entertaining | There are some minor inconveniences, but I see promise in this app. | I like clappers layout and there's more free speech | Very bad experience 😕 😞 because data was deleted by mistake from my phone, but again, I installed it. After that, it is still not working. After installation, it doesn't work Anybody has a solution. Please guide me because the clapper support team is not helping with any kind of this matter,s solve. .... | Is really good | So far it's good. Always have a plan B 😉😊 | So far, so good. I need to use the app for a while longer to give it a fair review. | Free to create your live without any restrictions. That way you can be exactly in a group of persons who think and want the same you do 👍 | Needs improvement. No way to look up friends. Lack of editing for videos. And you can't upload photo! | 👌 | Lot better tixtoc | The app is overall great, sure it needs more music and editing options but it is a decent app. I switch from tiktok and love it. You can earn money or coins, you don't have to have a set amount of followers to go live. Good job guys!! | Pretty good but definitely hope it gets better come on Team Clapper | Awesome!!!!!!! | Seems like a good app | I send my review about my signing up issues about this app yesterday and still didn't get any response back from your customer service. I guess you all don't care about keeping your customers happy or my improvement on your app... | Great so far. Hope it grows! | I got this app in case clock app gets banned. I like how it's more adult oriented, bc the heavy censorship of the clock app was annoying. I expect political, history, and comedy creators to like that. The clap back feature doesn't make much sense to me. Id like to see the option to add music and sounds. Download an editing app if you use clapper. | Love it just love it | I like the app but y'all need better music 🎶 for making videos. | Can't make an account nothing works on the app itself always get an oops something went wrong error message when trying to do anything | Totally positive, especially in contrast to tiktok. | I'm not happy on this app. It take for ever to com open. I'm not frustrated with you all I'm just asking when I go to see it it takes for ever to see the video that plays that's all. I'm not mad or angry. Just asking you why? | Simple | Breeding ground for pedophiles, if you report them, the app creators target you. If you are a parent or decent human, DON'T support this app delete it and review it appropriately! | I like this way better than tiktok and instagram people actually follow you and interact with you and give you tips on how to grow your platform. | Its just so bad. Audio is trash, video is bad, and most of the videos are just stolen content from other sites that stole content. Its just so bad. | Great support | Update: Did as the reply stated... still no response or access to Clapper. My email is real, and the app states otherwise. They must not want me as part of the community. How can I possibly review this app when I can't log in and get it set up. The videos I am able to look at are great but can't like or comment. Emailed support as instructed in other reviews and no answer. So far, customer service lacks, and so.... if I can't log in, I'll delete the app. | Better than the alternative and it's american owned | Why is this app not working in Pakistan? | It's similar to TikTok, so far it's good. The insanity with CGVs don't seem like an issue on clapper. It could use some more features | Clapper App is very similar to tiktok but you don't need thousands of followers to go live stream. It's pretty easy bonuses as long as you follow the guidelines. I'm still getting used to it but it has so much potential. | Censorship on tap! Opinions are not welcomed and pretty much you are told not to say anything that may expose what is the reality of American criminals! Clapper pretty much censored a post that said ""ghetto"" will never change and I guess clapper said that I am attacking a certain race of color and I guess a white latino can't say ghetto or you are censored! | This app is worthless | Its a great app but lacks monetization options for the streamers. It would be cool of we were allowed to make tip menus out of gift stickers with a option to tip by clicking on the screen. Also any kind of open broadcaster/ web view would be great for increasing video quality and customizing | Hot | Won't save a new profile picture. Needs video editing tools available after the sound is added. | Love the app but it to much about bingo on the livestream and gambling:( | Brand new user so I'm still new to the app but so far I really like it | It is through this app that I am currently being able to keep up with accurate news from Gaza right now, especially with the heavy censorship from the clock app. This app is actually allowing me to keep up with the current events. | Good alternative to tiktok | We should beable to use a green screen for our lives | I been contacting them to help me with my account but they don't reply at all. At this point i just feel like they are ignoring my request. | I started to switch to Clapper from TikTok, and I've noticed that the audio in every video I see is delayed by a second. My own videos don't have an audio delay before publishing, but the same thing happens to mine ones they're posted. | I can open the app and see whatever videos are on there, but it won't allow me to log in with my phone # or email. When I go to the sign in it sends me a code and says I already have an account, ON THE LOGIN PAGE NOT THE SIGN UP. I've tried multiple of my email addresses and It says I already have an account and there is also no password recovery if you forgot your password. Seems a little suspicious to me. | So far this is great and uncensored | If TikTok gets banned this is the place to go 😎 | Tried to create an account and I keep getting a notice that says ""login failed"". Unable to create an account | Fun | Similar to Tik Tok , but much better , I find it more user friendly. | Phone and app up to date. Clear cache and data and still have to shut down and restart app for it to work 66% loose local option and have to wait for awhile to get videos to load. Sounds like people don't know how to fix problems. Just creates more. This was a 5 star app but with all the recent problems and the copy and paste responses I believe this won't be fixed anytime soon. Hate to see good go so bad. But that's big tech for you. | I like this app, user friendly and easy to learn. It has a selling feature too which Iike. I do think the shipping locations need to be added so we can limit locations of sale or add as the seller sees fit or add a feature to adjust shipping prices to different countries. | So far, so good. I am not a content creator, but I love watching videos. Does that make me voyeuristic? Maybe, but I am here for it. Clapper, please stay away from congress, please and thank you. 😆🥰 | For you page isn't working | برنامج مسلي وعليه محتوى راقي | This app wont let me download it says someone already had it with my number and email the email i have has never been used for app and if someone had it with this number they sure in hell didnt have the same email as i did im in the u.s and i know plenty in my city who uses this app i reinstalled and all that still saying the same thing. | Would be a higher rating if the developers stopped the streamers from linking external accounts like fambase in their streams and bios. None of them want to interact on this app, they only want customers for other platforms. | Seems odd that this app is specific to which way you can sign up. Only by phone number, Google or Facebook. Just admit you are working together. That seems very problematic and troubling. Also giving poor network messages. My network is fine | Can't even download it | Pleasant experience ☺️ | I don't think this is a good app the short videos are a little too sexy for myself and for kids. The videos should not have so much sexy content it should have more videos with people that have more clothes on. | Clapper is nothing more than a cheap TikTok imitation. Don't waste your time! | Trash app does not work | Love the 👎option for videos you don't have any interest in! | Can't make an account. Can't search for my friend. Can't get anything to load. App does nothing. Google Pixel 8 pro | Great interaction funny emotional and I have obtained lots of knowledge on things from here | Its good but,I posted 2 video's and has not even gotten a single view and I still can't figure out the problem,is just getting soo annoying 😒😒😒😒 | speak your mind and get jail time for saying ""naked"". Facebook twin It's been fun | nice | Lagging,,number of followers should account for no less than 37% of live traffic and real interaction. | Broken it don't work Cleaning apdata isn't the problem cause if it was my phone wouldn't work at all. I can get the app the work after closing it and reopening it. Fix your code 🙄 | I deleted my account now I am trying to get back on and I get an error that says I already have a registered account is there a way to bypass this | Their fix of bugs on 4/15 has made the app buggy | Love the app, it's a bit hard to navigate and find things. But some things are better than tic tok. I like the fact you have a bit more freedom, plus you can go live as soon as you join. It's slow to load when you first load, but not bad. I just hope it doesn't get worse as more people switch over | unable to create an account. no option for support | Still same bug I Can't post nothing on the Platform not Even after 2 rounds of bugs fixing and I have been trying to change my profile picture for a while now And No success | Only just joined and I'm loving it already.❤️ | Pros; If you are familiar with TT then you will appreciate the transition to Clapper. Highly recommend. Cons; occasionally opens and gives a Signal/Network Error ""Refresh"". | Awesome | Fun | how to sign up it says something went wrong | Awesome | Very good best app ever | Feels like Flip a Gram, but lit | It's a great experience. You don't have to worry abopen trolls. And just yes, weird stuff. i'm banging for simple stuff | It's sort of like the tick-tock but what's better is You're definitely more free to say what's on your mind here. Unfortunately it tends to freeze at certain times. It's an easy and quick fix but still a bit annoying. And who knows what improvements will happen as time goes by. This has the potential to be better than TT or YT. | So far so good, I wish it had a digital zoom function for looking at the moon though. | Didn't optimize anything. Still trash! | Yikes | Still new to the app and building my community. People are not as chill as another app. | It's cool","{""1"":2152,""2"":272,""3"":959,""4"":2566,""5"":10293}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.99 - $249.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Clapper Media Group Inc.","Clapper+Media+Group+Inc.","developer@clapperapp.com","https://clapperapp.com",,"https://clapperapp.com/privacy","Clapper+Media+Group+Inc.","Social","SOCIAL","[{""name"":""Social"",""id"":""SOCIAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y6VrekFveBwuscjM2uNEq9gi8qGr7aWI260YRjLQhvdu1p3nvk2VareU9yGIFBPn_Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N31X7G6o_FByLYSZ2iPt9Urm3ym1a4oJlBMaB79gR_r8JkRyjNOMPjmeNd95mohtyeQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oU8vFzlN-tNZwp9IWw3FsgkHDsgomNEL6S3Ds2YaxDXSWCyDr84Tsx-OSFsksFTp3SmE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sPjSKTRtXyzEOb_W98emxNKZcjr98XSOjjb-kM40rbx6l3hDikzGhwB1SzxbhnITqdI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gq_Tuk9V4Ne_Trm2_EIj49F4mnrXuueJ_2vC0EN4WsooF7HcQcrwdaY5ct-acLk5miJL"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aO4lJ2AP_tCu4sK32kwV-Pai4GtgpmboGgEQatL_PKf5BKLv7etv7pN-senPzcms15k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RWE_KGxJXEL5vl-V7LHybyZOMTyJ-PE1iGUrFBr_ysQ01ekVWFzveYABT3VAlhBgqA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VsHbcZ-fu9nBMV9rPOMYBT0SFcJyBAdILjQrf9Jdr-r1XbhypCQQ9yPhLNG2QpmAq2Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6UEzsY6-qD0qDF2z-OpM7P6_vZ3_tqYaZNiWkcsJDVUNUuzAJXzM09-Tu3vKY0FcbfGi"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FC6nFpRESt2IxN2eRJOtTcGtfbOVBvqFbSvfVJGZUyzPTfzgVfSZKU7f5wBpqbVNVNVn""]",,,,"Mature 17+",,false,"Jul 4, 2020",1713173415000,"11.3.2","- Fixed some bugs.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.newsclapper.video","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newsclapper.video&hl=en&gl=US"

Don't bother to download it | Just sell the app and stop with the bs subscription. I dont want to subscribe to your app. Cringe. Don't download unless you want to pay for literally anything. Edit: Terrible response. The free features are useless, without the membership the app is as good as a bricked iphone. | Thoes who thinking this app worth every penny of it's pretty hefty price, definitely didn't heard about Chat GPT which this app using just a part of it. With less than 20$ you can use the Chat GPT Plus and a lots of more specialised apps which the Plant Identifier is just one of them! | I rather pay for a monthly plan than a yearly plan. But they force you to do a yearly only. Its sad because i love the app. But i dont love it enough to spend $20 on it instantly before actually checking it out | Love it | works great, easy to use. fast results | Awesome! | May be accurate BUT come on now!!! 29€ first year and then 45€/year. It is absolutely out of question. I Uninstalled immediately. | Quick and detailed | found plant right away | Not very accurate or detailed | fab app | App acts as free but isn't | Really handy and worked perfectly. Our cat ate a flower and we wanted to know if it was poisonous and this helped us identify the flower specifically. | I ❤️ this app! | TOO MUCH OF MY DATA IS REQUIRED | I use Picture This several times a week to id plants I don't know AND to diagnose my plants health. If my plant is sick I use the app to give me a treatment plan. I love it! | To costly | we need free version | Not free | I used the eapp one time for my kid and then out of no where 54 dollars taken from my account no notice or anything .........I get a 7-Day free trial but 54.00 after that no I want to refund | App is great and the reason for two stars. But the price and subscription is very deceptive and unclear. No notification trial is ending and almost 60 dollars charged with zero warning. Now they want to be very difficult on getting a refund. They keep pointing me in directions that do not work. But at the end of the day Google Play says contact the developer and I did. Come on do the right thing. Your preying on people with deceptive tactics for a very expensive app. | This app really helped me to identify the plant name which I don't know.If you are a Nature lover and explorer this app is useful one. | I think this is best app | Identified 1 plant for me then after that it wouldn't identify unless I paid for it | Looks great | Not worth paying for. You can at least give warning before you bill a years subscription. | This app is from a Hong Kong company, which means it's 'COMMUNIST' CHINESE SPYWARE. Even more suspicious is the fact that when I emailed support they flat-out refused to answer my question ""where is your company headquartered?"" Had to scroll to the bottom of the privacy to find this information. You nave all been warned. | Couldn't even try it out without committing a credit card first! | AI is inaccurate. It identified a blurry photo of my finger (accidentally hit the button to take a photo) as garlic. | has always properly identified any plant I've searched.. really like this app | Decent. Very fast. Plant identification was just okay—accuracy for my yard was about 75% or so. I've found a number of totally free apps that were slower, but identification was close to 90%, so better. Uses a rental system, so is very expensive. | love The free part! 😆 | lots of add of it self and less things they offer then talk | I am not paying for this B.S. | I did the free trial of this for 7 days and was unable to use it. I canceled because it is useless and they charged my card $53.00 anyway. So I tried using it again and still nothing. So basically they just stole $53.00 from me!! | absolutely amazing app | pongan el pago mensual, para yo poderlo comprar, cuando lo hagan les pongo 5 estrellas | awesome app | Was very excited about using the app until I realized that the only way I could really enjoy this app is if I start the free trial then pay monthly...To me this isn't a free app or maybe I didn't read the fine print well enough. | Thanks for allowing folks to try out your app . The few times I've used it I found out there's a couple of fantastic variety of flowers and plants around . I cannot make any purchases now so being able to at least try these type of apps a bit was helpful especially when you move to a completely different area the what your accustom .There are plenty of different plants ,weeds and flora around to use this app on . The app is very helpful then simply trying to guess . | Love this app. Worth it | continually bombards you with ads to upgrade to premium, I would happily pay a 1 time fee for the app but I dont use it enough to justify a subscription. | Only 14 days free 🙁 | This is the first app I go to with plant care and ID questions. It's the only app I recommend to people I give plants to through my local Buy Nothing Group. | should give free diagnostics on sick plants. accurate 60% of the scans. always do a double check on Google image search. | I love this application | I love this app, I tried using other apps to identify a random plant in my yard and none of them works till this one. 100% this app is staying ony must download list! | Good App | I love using Picture This. Every time I walk the dog or walk by an interesting plant at work I just snap a photo with the Picture This app and receive easy to read info regarding that plant. I love incorporating ""found"" plants into my container garden. Today I found two Star of Bethelehem flowering on my lawn. Scooped them up and added them to my Amaranth pot to continue blooming. Gorgeous! The app said they were healthy specimens. | This app is a trick bag they don't tell you that they charged you money until after you download it | Love this app. My 4th year with a garden and I get overwhelmed beforehand like it's the very 1st year....but THIS has slowly made the anxiety disappear. I think having a plant doctor on call is a very amazing thing for nerves!! | Loved 😍 | No way I'm paying $70 | Excellent app.. Helps you to know more about your plants so you can keep them longer and healthier | So I downloaded this and it's states 2.99 per month . Then if you use the free 7 day trial it's 4.17 a month. It says $50.00 a year at one spot then 35.99 at another. What is the real prices. | Usually this app is correct on the ID of plants. It has made mistakes like 5%. | it's better than awesome | People needing this to live shouldn't have to pay for information on plants or instructions on plants and food. Some people depend on info for life saving foods and who have food allergies. Every time I opened the app it kept giving me the choice for free for 7 days or out right paying. I can't get past that without choosing to buy. What part is still free? | Love being able to identify plants! | soo helpful | Disappointed... Just purchased app today to try to identify two plants my wife was asking about. It failed on both, whereas Google lens seemed to get me what I needed. Somehow, I thought this app would have been better than Lens since its primary purpose is for plants and trees. Going to give it another try on a house plant that is not doing well. I will probably be cancelling within the trial window if it doesn't do better. | Plant | Works so great! I love this app. Now, I can identify plants that I would like to have in my yard . Great app!!! | it's really good at identifying! | This has been my 5* go-to app for reliability and accuracy for several years, but recently, it has been misidentifying several seedlings. I hope this will be fixed soon or I will have to find another app. Sorry to have to down grade the rating at this time. | Rubbish | Great app. Helped me a lot with identifying vegetables and very user friendly. | This app is no good. It says it's for free but keeps taking money every year even if you just have a free trial. Untrustworthy | 4🌻 | links to my digital drive licence photo | Works really well | PictureThis is listed as free, but it is not free. They start you off immediately with the scummy ""free trial"" business. I know better than to fall for that trick, and I am leaving this review as a warning to others. This kind of scammy business model gets one star from me. | amazing app | great app. dependable information. easy to use. highly recommend this app. | Lost my whole profile. Apparently, if you let the sub expire it will delete all the plants you saved and all the list you made. Not great. Works pretty good identifying plants but several apps do that | Great tool for identifying plants and tree's. | Not free | This helps me to identify my plants and flowers | I tried and tried and tried to cancel my subscription.

All I get now is 480p, I'm on a Samsung S9+ tablet, and I KNOW I can do 4k... | Make you drink alcohol and live like the songs rather listen to christian music | Excellent | I definitely love this streaming service now that you have Nickelodeon and Comedy Central now if we can only get boomerang lol | Very good. | Also the songs about being a great friend. | All I want is YouTube so I can watch my niece to listen to my music okay please pick me up | Been very happy | THE BEST OF THE BEST SIR 💕💕💕💕 | Like | i Love it | Not working | Love it, any question on how to do something, it's available to watch. Series on Vietnamese families building a life on camera. Anything from birth through death. It's great | This app usually doesn't play properly. The video will be playing, but it's lagging. It's hard for the video to keep up with the audio, and this is often 😔 even after I update the app it does the same thing | You said it was free TV but from what I have read it cost $75 to get it. I deleated this because of that. | It's great, but when will be regain SNY and YES network channels? | Very good some of themost insporational songs i love | Turn location off! | Ui is garbage and buggy. Switching to Hulu live when my free trial ends. Also get a Black screen with sound alot of times. Have to close app and come back. As youtube doesn't care and won't respond here, my money is best spent elsewhere. Probably the worst set up out of all of them. Can't trust your library if you watch on multiple platforms as you will have new episodes get watched but will still show as needing to be watched | Love it easy to use and great learning tool | Better than cable | It had movies | TV is necessary. | I installed it and then Uninstalled it because I didn't really even know why I was installing it in the first place because I love and have and use the original YouTube app from Google anyways. :) | Love it | I love the affordable streaming option & recording | Awesome 💯 | Horrible performance on samsung tablet. Use to work fine but now freezes. All other video apps work great. Netflix prime video and even standard youtube. App needs significant improvement compared to other streaming competitors. Horrible | much easier to find apps and I'm 65 yrs | Not a big fan of the app. I wish it was similar to the TV. I do not move around the app easily. | Good 😊 U.♿ | My only place to watch | Meditation manipulation sounds | Good to me | This app is bogus... constant glitching and buffering...i tried to give them time to fix..no good..I'll save my money | It was a good app and is so helpful. | Was told it was free. It's not! | It's really cool paying all this money every month to be limited to 480p in the Android app. Higher resolutions available through the browser on the same device. Pretty lame, Google. | And it just gets worse, time to find an alternative....back to cable tv probably. | All of the YouTube apps r my TOP FAVORITE APPS!!!!!! | These people that run this are thieves. I have been unsubscribed for a few months now and they pulled three charges on my credit card in two days. Like how does that happen? | Won't let me watch TV when I travel | I'm like YouTube videos on Facebook | Greatly appreciated!!!!! | Dude it's APRIL. Do we really need NFL Sunday Ticket pushed on us every 30 seconds? It doesn't even start till SEPTEMBER. So what, pay a couple hundred for something that's not even usable for another 6 months?? That make any sense to you guys?? | Awesome Account Google | I love the music and this app entertainment an informational thank you | Not getting my personal data Nor shall smart people allow But too many dumdums out there will screw your collection of data | When I open the app on my pixel 7 pro it I just a black screen when I select a program. I still hear the audio but just on a black screen. | Very good just way too many long ads | I wasn't a fan, made my ohone slow! | SILENT on Pixel 7 Pro- max volume sounds like 10%, almost impossible to hear | Nothing wrong with the quality of the app, it's the payment and billing that needs significant work. Make payment on 8-26 only to have my subscription be cancelled a week later and then still keep trying to charge me everyday for an account that I was told ""isn't active"" Let's add in now that a game that is being played in my city is blacked out from a national channel! | Very happy with service had misunderstood billing I did re quet account. | Can't fast-forward through recorded shows | The latest update causes unending crashes. I will be cancelljng the servuce absent a fix soon. | Nice | ইউটুব চেলান | Horrible price for not such entertainment you U Tube TV is just in it for the money and people that once like the shows that are now only on U Tube TV are getting scrutinized just because they can not afford the out rageous price a month that U Tube TV charges. Go away | Recordings are glitchy when watching them, so much I don't watch them. Update: 4/20/24 Seems to have been fixed. | I love it!!! ❤️ | Buggy. Using a Google phone with Google Chromecast and it always, ALWAYS cuts out multiple times during sports games, so you have to reconnect. Unclear why their products don't work well together.. | App is now slow and keeps crashing. May have to switch to another provider after 4 years. | app is keeps crashing. I'm not sure why I'm paying for something that doesn't work. | good | Good app 8 like it a lot | The app has become so buggy and casting barely works | App has been misbehaving on my z Fold 5 for some time. It casts to my Nest Hub, okay, but using the app on my Fold 5 nearly always results in a black screen on top, with a smaller box below. It's just a mess. I tried a fresh install but that didn't make any difference. | Expensive for non HD channels | Excellent channel selection. Easy to use and works on all devices. | It's good but it cost way too much when I can find it somewhere else for Less Price | Updates messed up video on Samsung tablet | Unusable.

I was thinking it would log me in my first account because I had about 266000 in gems and withdraw a few times before I lost all time and work it took for the progress I was doing and for this app not to give me back my first account is silly and wrong | Has not gave me a reward in over a week and ive played dailey | God Is Sooo great | cool app | Works pretty well you can make about 5 dollars every 2 days if you stay consistent | unique twist on an original Bingo game | A good way to earn extra cash on the side | It started out fine, was getting credited for the time spent playing. But around the third or fourth game, I stopped getting credited for playing entirely. This happened with even new games I played. Not sure if it was a glitch or scam, but it was a huge letdown. | Good | good game | I love it 💞 | Good | Meh | It took away the option to use PayPal. Pleasr fix this issue. It was a good app til then. | no way to get to PayPal that I can find. poor selection of games. | cash giraffe is good to have if you need fast cash on hand it's the way to go | It's a lot of fun | cool app thank you | Alright | Bro, I tried cashing out and it didn't work. IT SPENT ALL MY GEMS AND I CANT CLAIM THE REWARD!!! YALL BETTER FIX THIS. | I've been playing a month now religiously everyday. Not even close to having a decent gift card or anything worth have. Yeah I might could buy a discount but that's it. DO NOT RECOMMEND!! I EVEN PLAYED A TOP PAYING GAME. | I haven't figured it out yet . | Face verification is super unfair even with light being adjusted. I see no way for me to contact support and now I cant cash out. Been playing for a while so Im super disappointed. Im going to uninstall and go to JustPlay where im appreciated and get My money the same day too | I came back I like how easy this app is and selection of games are better than most. I'm making a few bucks here and there. I'm back in April 2024 and it won't cash out due to verification. I need help with this as I have already been thru the process and after the update I can't cash out. I love this app I hate to uninstall just for that. The games are plenty in variety. Still can't cash out due to verifying | Biggest scam I have ever seen | Good | time consuming finding what to do next | good game | Can someone explain why the rewards changed? When I first downloaded this, it showed that you can get gift cards once you reach a certain amount. Now all the gift cards are gone and it only have coupons. What is going on? | I liked the app until I found out it didn't pay in US currency and I have money on my PayPal account I can't use because it's in Eur currency | great game with reward | all good | Great | 🙂 | I would give a higher score but it's missing days that I have played so not getting my coins. To cash in coins you now have to take a picture and video yourself. Really??? Uninstalled. | great app easy money | Got enough points for a $5 PayPal payout. Been over a week and still no funds added.scam just trying to get your banking info. Be aware. | This used to be the best pay as you play app last year. I don't know what happened I've been waiting for a pay out to my PayPal since 4/13/24. Theirs no support to msg as far as I know. What is the problem last year it wouldn't even take a day and it would be in my PayPal account. | I don't much like it. | It's alright when it works. Far too often you play games and you don't get credits for it. Trouble is that you don't know until you've spent 30 mins playing and then you find out later it hasn't registered. At first I thought it was because I hadn't clicked on the link in the app to start the game, but even though I do it all the time now it's still hit and miss as to whether I get credits for it. Update, it's getting worse, some days just not registered at all even though playing loads. | DONT DOWNLOAD THIS ONCE YOU GET THE ENOUGH GEMS FOR A GIFT CARD, THEY BLOCK THAT OPTION WITHOUT TELLING YOU. | love this app gives you amazing possibilities for extra cash | cool | very nice | So far so good., 😊 | Yeah you don't make too much on this but honestly it's still you can make something that's better than nothing now ot won't let me get into it | Good game | Where's the cash payout? Now that I have enough for a cash payout all there is to select is discounts and deals. I got one deal for up to 65% off at walmart.... just to be directed to the flash deals section of the Walmart app. Really? I was charged for what is readily available. You can't read what the prize entails beyond the button has. You click the selected prize (maybe to get better detail on the generic label) and you bought it. I'm not bent over the 4899 points. No cash pay? I'm gone. | It sucks won't even give me one game to play with only surveys | The page ask me to make a sign into GMAIL they wouldn't exsept my normal gmail.? Explain to me what you really need. Thank you | Hasn't payed out yet and has stopped recording playing time | relaxing and fun | Good so far | I so enjoy these games | it's the best | Thanks and God bless you!!; | CASH GIRAFFE IS A SCAM. When I first started playing this game it was good I could cash out with PayPal, not real big amounts but at least it was real. Then they took away PayPal from me so I had to find another app to cash out with and the only one that was ok was Walmart. I had a bunch of coins built up so with so many coins I could get a 65% off coupon. I tried using it many times but it never would. This app is a scam just like the rest of them. | Appealing interesting | I got this app for some coupons so I can save a little more money when I went to go earn some no apps were available so I waited and waited when that didn't work I tried Uninstalling it and bringing it back still didn't work so I tried to just do some surveys that didn't work either waste of space! | All it did was take me to a bingo game apps. I don't like bingo. That's sneaky trash. I ha ve uninstalled without playing bingo game. It didn't mention bingo. It looked very uninstresting. I tried to take star off because I'm not happy with app. I don't liked to be passed around to apps like that. Very disappointing. No star griaffe | Idk | Nice | This game suck | it is a good one | Busted A$$ app. Tried multiple times to download and use. Every time I just get a single error popup in-app and then it's blank. | Scam. There's no option for PayPal or any other actual gift card or payout. The payouts are like 50% off at Home Depot, and when you click on it, it takes you to the Home Depots page, but THAT'S IT. I tried several. NONE WORKED. | I like the app but it deleted all the games I had in the app to earn money is there anyway to get them back in the app | The app behind MystPlay. STAY AWAY! | I haven't received one dime from you yet okay? | Just started don't know much about it accept takes a long time to occured points | we will see | Disappointing. I Cashed. enough In. for $10 of PayPal cash. And it's been just about 24 hours and I have not received yet. | Cashed out $10 after weeks of playing and still have not been paid. Says its still pending after a week of waiting. This game is a fraud!!!! | AAA awesome!!!!!! | in my own opinion cash giraffe is very good to get a piece of mind 😜 and I love that for me and others | Real good | it takes time to level up... as long as you have patience ✨️ 😌 | Great app for real cash games. Thank you. | Fun enjoyable | Fun | I am only giving this 1 star because I haven't been able to can out but my husband has no problems | Great | love it | Was good now all good payout options are gone. What happened to PayPal. | good rewards | Great | It works but it doesn't give me credit for all the time I play my phone says I played longer then the game gives me credit for!!!! | Way too many adds. | Great game try it | HORRIBLE APP. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! I Tried to get my payout for a $5 Amazon card... App took my 46,594 points then popped up an error message! Soooo nothing for me. Customer service /support doesn't exist. Waste of time for me. UPDATE SAME THING AGAIN in APRIL 2024 I thought I'd try the app again Coins were taken and been processing since 4/07/24. They got me again. Emailing support team does nothing. A bot responds and is NO HELP AT ALL. | This app doesn't give you anything. I opted for several. The offers are other known apps that already offer deals and low prives. It didn't give anything as far as putting money in the venmo or chime. It made me sign up for nothing. I emailed them.

Ugh. | Literally just want to download my tickets onto my phone, but I can't get into the app. Similar issues to other reviews - I was originally logged in but every time I went to ""My Events"" it would close on its own, to the point where my phone asked me what to do with this app that refuses to work. I uninstalled and reinstalled, and the login page navigates out from the app and then the app itself freezes. ""Your app is your ticket!"" My app doesn't work 🙄 | Will not operate after recent update. Avoid yhe app and use internet which works fine. | Unable to login to join ticket que. Don't trust the app. | App crashes constantly. It is difficult to get tickets into the wallet and it is difficult to even buy tickets. I couldn't buy tickets to a show on the mobile app OR on a desktop because Ticketmaster is so unstable. | I have a valid presale code that came directly from Ticketmaster in an email and from the band, and yet it kept saying it wasn't valid. | My best suggestion to get tickets for any concert... It's been a breeze using this app... | DOESNT LET YOU SIGN IN WITH THE NOTE20 | Tried to buy tickets last night to a show and it said there was routine maintenance going on. Log back in this morning and they raised the price on the standard ticket from 57 to 63. These aren't resell tickets either. I only use this bs site because it's the only ticket provider available | It's been very friendly, easy to navigate, reliable. | App is pretty nice, good job developers. Ticketmaster is evil, avoid them at all costs. Buy tickets directly from the artist or venue, if possible. Avoid giving these scammers $20 fees per ticket. | Can never sign in, useless app! | Worst app that I ever installed | All you need to know about Ticket Master and its app is that people who don't use it say things like ""everything I hear about Ticket Master is bad"" and ""I knew this would be bad when I found out it was through ticket master."" Truly a horrible app and corrupt company. App never sent me my ticket qr code in time, and gave no option for a refund. Got cheaper tickets at the venue then the app. | Awesomeness 👌 | Booking via app and says I am a bot. Blocks me from buying and later shows me all resale tickets | Horrible app. Unstable, can't login. Whatever 5 year old they got to design the app, needs to start school. | I can't sign in no matter what I do. All it does is leave me on a blank black screen and I can't look at my tickets. | Absolutely useless. You can't log in less you skip the initial section and open the login page in browser. Tried to save my tickets to my Google Wallet and it threw an error. | Idiot app, always blocks me and claims that I am a bot. | Does nothing but crash | When tickets go on pre-sale, it always crashes and asks me to verify my account, and an error occurs. I call customer service, and they say it's not the app, but it is. It happened to me twice within the span of the year. I used to like ticketmaster but will never get tickets from them again. Also, the added on fees are horrible. They overcharge way too much at checkout. | I`m Enjoying My Ticket Master-Buy & Sell Tickets!!! | Ticketmaster allows bots to purchase tickets before humans, and it really pisses me off | Frequently fails to load the sign in page, it is easier to go to a web browser than to use the app. Yes, I have updated it today - continues to fail to load the login screen. | Asks me to authenticate my account and then gives me an error when I punch in the code from both my phone or my email. | It literally just doesn't work you can't log in | Keeps crashing saying there is a bug in the app, and wait for the developer to provide an update. This app is useless. | The app keeps crashing and i cant buy tickets or look at my tickets. | Does everything the app of this company needs to accomplish in a good UI and easy to use interface Say what you will about the nature of the business but the team that built this app/maintains this did a great job for the customer. | Can't even log in 95% of the time | error trying to transfer tickets | Garbage app that won't load my tickets, the sole thing it needs to do. | Absolutely awful app, i was forced to update to the new app from Ticketmaster AU app and now can't receive transferred tickets. Always resets to US cities despite setting to AUS. | Wee? | Is it possible to give ZERO Stars? This has to be the most dysfunctional app ever foisted on the general public. The web version is almost as bad but if you wait long enough it will eventually let you sign in...and for now the print ticket function still works. Installed the latest update...now can't sign in...app freezes. Uninstalled, reinstalled...nothing, zero, zilch chance of ever logging in. Stupid! 3 weeks later...still won't login. Another uninstall - reinstall - nothing. The show will | Old app worked fine, updated to new app because I was made to. New app keeps crashing. Won't log me in. Can't access tickets. | Our concert is tomorrow night and the app keeps crashing. My phone gave me an error message saying to try again after the developers fix the bug. Only the home screen works | Beyond awful. Why have an app...if I need to login through a web browser? And then when I try to...it freezes up when pushing back to the app? Ridiculous. And worse? They're the only way to access ANY tickets...because this company owns access to every event! Hideous. | Can't even go to my tickets, crashes as soon as I click anything. | Screwy as hell | Couldn't sign in, crashed several times. I ended up uninstalling and going back to the previous app. | This is an awful app run by an awful company. Constantly crashing and not allowing me to purchase tickets for seemingly no reason. The modern-day concert ticket buying process is such a nightmare. Update: this app is still awful and Ticketmaster is still awful. Hoping they get investigated soon. | I've been unable to log into this App since I upgraded and looking at the terrible ratings it seems Ticketmaster have no intention of improving in. I've uninstalled it and now use the website which works fine. So much for monopolies making things better. Zero stars. | This app is the absolute worst, but they have a monopoly, and it has to be used. So you want to spend extra money? No? Too bad, do it if you want to see a show. Do you want to disagree with anything Ticketmaster does? No? Too bad, so it is you want to see a show. | Just spent 2 grand on tickets and cant even log on to access them. | An app to enable scalping | App never works when I want it to. Sometimes I just can't buy tickets. Such a pain. There, I rated your app after you asked me. Are you happy now? | There is no reason ticket service fees should be different for different areas of a venue. It's just an excuse to scam people out of more money. I hope I get to see the day ticketmaster/AXS falls. | Constant login issues. Only works if you have never changed the default browser | Constantly making me sign in again. Half the time it fails to even load the sign in page so you can't sign in at all. | Unable to sign into app. Enter login details press the login button and then it just sits there doing nothing Update still unable to log in | Bought tickets to a concert through the tickmaster monopoly. Paid irrationally high fees, and now can't use the app to access my tickets. The app stalls out at the login. Useless. | Worst app worst company | fix the damn bugs, app got worse | This is an awful company with an awful app. Nothing has ever worked for me on the app like it is supposed to, and every single time I have ever used Ticketmaster there has been some huge hassle or problem. Since they are the only company to buy tickets to events through any more, I guess I will not be attending any more ticketed events. Nothing is worth the frustration or the hours I have spent dealing with this terrible company time and time again over the years | Keeps crashing | Crashes when trying to view my events and won't let me log in after reinstalling | App was very easy to use. Thanks for the tickets. | TicketMaster app SUCKS and customer service is even worst. I accidentally bought tickets twice given the poor yser interface and ticketmaster will not issue a cancelation and refund for my accidental purchase. | They force you to download their app in order to get your tickets. Can't even print at home. Now I have to drag my phone in to the show. Not to mention now having their freaking app on my phone when I don't want it there. UPDATE: They know their process is fraught with problems, so they encourage you to add the ticket to Google Wallet, and this gives an error. Searching the error reveals people having this issue back as far as 2023 and NO SOLUTION. | Ticketmaster is a tumor that steals money from both artists and consumers, I hate what they've done to the live music scene | Terrible I hope the US sue you | Poor system ever!! You always fail me every time I have to buy the tickets you have only one job but you always fail!! | Terrible app, it kept kicking me off the queue whenever I would switch apps. May as well purchase tickets on a browser. Don't waste your space with this app. | Keeps closing while trying to use the app. | Absolutely junk. Can't function to even verify an account to do a transfer. Constant something went wrong message. I have never had a good experience with the app. | Trash app, trash company. App crashes when you try to buy tickets or get stuck in infinite loading screens. | You cant click on any of the notifications or see the tickets themselves. Dont bother with it. | Asks for verification before joining a queue but then doesn't accept the code and shows a ""we need to try your request again"" dialog instead. Made me lose tickets thank you for nothing 👍 garbage app | It never works | Amazing love this app! | This app is always glitchy to use even when no large sale is happening. The like function hasn't worked in weeks and the search function sucks which just makes it worse. I have never been able to successfully buy tickets on this app when time was an issue as it would never load. Only thing this app is good for is showing tickets to get into shows which even then there are easier ways. Overall this app is a waste of time just use a computer or browser. | Keeps crashing everytime I go to view my tickets. Should still give me the option to print paper tickets if you can't make the app function as intended. | Hot garbage that isn't functional with non-existent customer service done by one of the worst chatbots that's ever beed designed. Looking forward to the day this company's monopoly finally gets broken up so we dont have to suffer with their complete lack of componentce. | Easy & fast to use. | Sso far it's been very hard to sign in. It sends me off to my browser (duckduckgo) and just seems to hang. Another person told me that it worked fine for them with Chrome. I'll try that and maybe report back. | Installed app for ticket, app cannot cope with me signing in. Message check internet connection & try again later. Immediately went back to web browser signed in and downloaded my ticket and saved to Google Drive. Uninstalled POS app. | Absolute rubbish pos | Always easy to use Appreciate that as sometimes App's not easy to access | Garbage app, can't even log into. I open the app, click log in, which takes me to the ticket master website, input my credentials, and nothing. It just spins. Tried multiple times over multiple days, finally gave up and uninstalled.","{""1"":67400,""2"":8606,""3"":5245,""4"":8546,""5"":48903}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Ticketmaster L.L.C.","5712692731004758815","app@ticketmaster.com","http://www.ticketmaster.com",,"https://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacy.html","5712692731004758815","Events","EVENTS","[{""name"":""Events"",""id"":""EVENTS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KmWVboPY-BCCfiflJ-AYCPGBv86QLMsXsSpvQksC0DVR8ENV0lh-lwHnXrekpHwbQA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rJRk6-WITYtCqLsSz9LLY9Wbl-_r6atSCF04K9WTZ87GZxFAibkzBvWC4Msh6ZfiWEQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EG5uMOi5LjTDBYLiCatuxIbOoZEqYk7zq8kmyM_dfnJSQw4xzSshP6pHuyaDJFKT3lU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DmhuIeriX8h9BtlvdVnthAksX1e1zzc4CaTzl54iVyo4S-oQazuL-XTO6KwS3V4ALNWo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tCGaetnlu0DKG6iexO58s07667zYeQPu2JPyDaQJdOBkFBJDJBBfB4ReAJqR6a5aaA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VwbJs9kZio7QF8yfk30VibJAuGTDjYkVxgCWzP-sel06MbL_i14HhrV1A8IWM9qDlsU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q_U-9Ei--ltAB7BMxICh37yJfwDEWk6WqJyKoJ7rJBNjIzqErIMjU0ObOUK2dhTz8pa7"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vDz9RGw4A7I73Yt74OIsGJMjzcNOUJO__ziiHH_WQYmUc2LPjtRmxTFQSQnnMiZnP1U""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"May 21, 2012",1713404295000,"250.0","We update our app often in order to make it easier than ever to bring you unforgettable moments.

Not able to search for anything. | I love how easy it is to keep track of my receipts with this app, but their pricing is so frustrating. None of their prices are honored in store. | Poor design. Swiping through item pictures is very finicky and difficult. Why do you show me 8 different camera angles of some products but completely avoid showing the side with nutritional information? I can't go by Target's provided info, because it's sometimes wrong. Also, when you're choosing substitute items, you can't easily see if they are low stock.

Store location lookup is broken, so I can't set my store. And because I can't set my store, the app repeatedly pesters me to set my store. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't fix. App used to work, but now it's an exercise in frustration. | Yay | Target Circle offers is buggy for me, and the app doesn't work sometimes at checkout so I lose the 5% red card discount. | If you are a big Target stock investor, please fix their marketing team.

After the tip, it requests a second tip! This happens with every order. | Gets new card. Opens up app to activate it. App needs to send verification code via email. 30 minutes later finally get code. Enter code into app. App responds with please try again later. Repeat. Throws new card into trash unverified. This is on top of the normal horrible Target app experience. | I can't pay my bill. Not there anymore. what did you do with it. Make it simple to pat Mt redcard bill. | app is not working. extremely frustrating. it keeps asking for my preferred location and cannot find it. | Don't need | I spent 150 on my debit at Target. Trying to scan my receipt and I can't find where to scan it. I've googled and it's not helping. I used to be able to scan old receipts no problem. It's not old. Brand new receipt. | Easy to use, however, losing the option to pay my redcard off from the app like previous verisons isn't as simple as it use to be. Searching for items needs a bit of work as well. | The app is broken. It does not apply a gift card when the gift card is part of the payment even though it calculates the gift card towards the purchase in the preview for payment. | Update: I don't like doing reviews but I am done shopping at Target in general. There is too much politics at Target, furthermore with the new update you don't get your Target reward money without doing the bonuses. The bonuses are supposed to be personal but I don't even purchase the items they suggest. Those few dollars that I would collect because of the old Target reward program came in handy, especially as a mom with little kids. | It worked fine when I used it before, I hope it does today also. | Ever since you updated the app i can't find my balance, pay my bill, or anything because it has you jump from site to site. I'm signed in then takes me to another site where I try to log in again and will not let me. Guess who's not getting paid next month. | You give me a pop up notification for a deal. I click on it. But before I can do anything I have to rate my last delivery. There's no way to get around rating my last delivery there's no skip. Even when I rate and tip the last delivery person the screen still won't go away. You can email me when you resolve this issue but until then I'm deleting the app. You probably just lost out on hundreds of dollars a month that I order. I don't have time for apps that don't work properly. | Order/ pay for a prerelease & get it seven days after the release date while paying extra for shipping. Do not recommend. | Ok l | Really good, especially for me it helps me know the special since my work hours vary that way i know whether to go straight home or I can make a quick stop to the store. | It's. Ok | Just love me some target | Need target app And need | Used to be able to scroll & save deals, offers, items to shop on my next shopping trip. Today I get to the store, deals aren't there. Tried searching for them while in the store. Bought the items, it didn't take off previously saved Coupons & didn't give me the $5 Gift Card I was supposed to get with my 3-Dove Product Purchase. Even with signs posted up & down the store aisle. Getting Deals & Cash back to use for future purchases was what I loved about Target. Quite Annoying!! #EpicFail | The latest update has made product searching a nightmare. It no longer knows which store location I'm in and won't let me change store and view the item. It puts it in my car for that store. OMG I'm trying to see stock while shopping a shipt order. FIX THIS!!! OVER A MONTH LATER AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED..... Still not fixed | There's no way to filter out third-party sellers now? They used to have this option, can't find it now. That's a big downgrade in the shopping experience. I come to Target to see the products that they have curated, not random items from unknown companies. That's what Amazon is for. I like the app overall though. Also why is it soo hard to swipe through the product pictures? (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠) | Unreliable stock inventories. | The app now constantly pops up asking your location, but before you can type in a zip it pops us asking two or three more times. Then it says no target exists. The target I can see from here. I uninstalled and reinstalled a few times l, might work for a day. I reported it twice but no response. It's been doing this for a month now. | I hate the recent changes. PLEASE move the deals to a separate tab from the coupons. I have to scroll through a sea of unactionable items to find the coupons now, and I can't even sort the list to get the deals to go to the bottom. It's extremely frustrating and time-consuming now to find and apply coupons. You're not gonna get me to buy random stuff by forcing me to scroll through the deals. Give me control over my shopping planning, please. | Seneanlo Nlonseanlonseanlo. Klonseamlonsea. Gloneanlon monseanl o WondonBlonesanlon. Yonseanlon. Seonsea. Eonseanloa. Hlonseanlo. Deanlonsea | Difficult | Update 4/2/24: Will up my stars when the app stops signing me out AND when it stops asking me to verify my card RIGHT BEFORE I'M CHECKING OUT IN A PHYSICAL STORE. Ridiculous | All I want to do is search for items. It forces me to log in, which I can't do when I'm in the store. Try to go to the website via Google search, and it just kicks me back to the useless app. Oh well, good reason to have one less app on my phone. | This new app upgrade is extremely frustrating. Every time I try to check my credit card information, it says it has to send a pass code to my email, but as soon as I switch tabs in my phone, the sign in page disappears thereby creating a loop of me not being able to log in. *Update:Just got off the phone with Redcard services and the rep did not provide any solutions other than suggesting me to use a computer which is not feasible for me. Please just fix the app as this was not an issue before. | The app used to be easy and convenient. Now with the updates, I can't save offers. I don't like the automatic saved offers. Please bring back how it used to be. | I cannot sign into my account! It keeps posting an error message once I open the app. I have tried force stop and also uninstalled as well as reinstalled but nothing works!!!! I have an android. Fix this! I can send you the error message. | It's a great app to have when you are looking for something. Thank you. | Great for comparing like items | While I love this app, why can I no longer scan receipts for my Target wallet? Whenever I try, I get the message, ""This event is not valid"". The ones I'd like to put in are less than 21 days old, which is the cutoff point for entering them, by the way. Are receipt scans not a thing Target offers anymore? Or is this a glitch? | The 1% Cash back was the only reason I liked the app and you got rid of it. And didn't even let me use the last of what I had saved. Just the worst. | Target no longer recognizes my still-current Shipt membership and is forcing me to pay for 360 service to continue using delivery services on their app. | It's supposed to work as a card but it keeps locking you out. I tried a bunch of times and finally deleted it. | I love you Target but forcing a customer to leave a review is just madness & very irritating! That needs fixing ASAP....I can't really say how an order delivery went if I didn't see the person themselve deliver my items.Yes I gave you one star bc that is a huge NO for me. I have to back out & close the app just to bypass it but just pops back up every time I want to look at something else 🙄 | Whoever updated this app is a retarded pos | App gives a terrible shopping experience. It seems to always log you out when you're about to check out. The target red card bar code never works. | Loved the app until this recent update. I can not add anything to my cart. | Loved it | Super user friendly app! So easy to find products in store with the aisle numbers listed and to see if it's in stock or where I can find it. I like the accessibility of accessing my previous purchases for returns or reordering items. | Great quick delivery. | iit sucks!!! | Love target | Great! | April 2024: Whatever stupid improvmw improvements they made were childish athetic choices with zero functionality. When I'm looking at an item, if I select one of the related items underneath, then press the BACK key - instead of going BACK to the last item, I will taken to the home screen. Seems minor, but very annoying. Also, after selecting items from past orders, it will likewise take me to the Checkout after pressing [Add To Cart], instead of BACK to the previous order. | App will not let me sign in for some reason | Unable to look up nearest store by ZIP code | I love this app. 😀 | Different ideams | New updates suck. Very annoying to access account information and card info. | Does what it's supposed to. | T from b and @4×54 ; b bbbb | Just got this with a benefit or perk with my phone and it's westcoastfinest tight | 5 Estrellas | I can't login to my account | Too many issues with the barcode scanner not working | O enjoy tsrgft & it wss not dkcci ult to re recreate my password. Targets items are st gkmes too ecpensive on somrtjingd & gjey meed more womsn clothes & skirts O do not wear pants due .to.my religon. Lined slwsys too long. Needbmore cssbiers | Takes too long to simplify and Shopify online at Target close my account | Just got my first package ordered from the app and an item is missing. Tried to select ""fix issue"" but it would not let me select the item with the issue. Had to call Target's customer service line to get anything done about my missing item. Can't recommend shopping with Target with issues like this. | Your A target | Can no longer log into app it refreshes and request my password multiple times. Although I can login online. | Fantastic awesome love her quilting | App very efficiently drains my bank account. Sells me everything I need. They are too good at what they do. They must be stopped | Why can you no longer make a payment or view balance and activity on the app!! | I'm trying to pay my bill through the App , it keeps kicking me out as soon as it sends me the 6 digit code. Never had this issue till the new update. | App won't let me log in - just keeps going back and forth to the sign in page to the shopping page. Not sure what's going on but I assume it's a big with the update. It's an okay app but this bug makes it unusable. | Terrible. Racist! I can't make an account because I don't have a valid last name? I tried the name ""Smith (which is not my real name) and it was fine with that. Racist app. | The email me if something is not available and they get the right items that I need they are very good | Whoever is responsible for designing this app is just plain awful. I cant even get to my red card any longer. I now have to login to my Target account first and then red card portion wants to log me in again but not before sending a code to which when you go to retrieve the code it logs you out all the way back to the beginning. I understand. Android and the concept of apps just came out last week so its all pretty new. You'll get it someday... Hang in there! | I know 1% Circle earnings might not seem like a lot but it definitely added up. It was a huge part of why I regularly chose Target over other places. Add this and tha ability to scan receipts to add them to your purchases back please! Until then I will most likely shop elsewhere. | App won't allow me to select a store. My best friends to try to set it for me but they can't do it either. Uninstalled then reinstalled but no better.

It is easy to make payments from the app. | Great experience | Like that is easy to use | Exelente y facil | Ease of use and intuitive design make this app one of the best financial apps I've used | omg too many ads in the app. what a waste of time and all intended for you to click on something you don't want. there's no way to avoid the pop-ups. | It works, could be more intuitive. | I think I made it through this without much trouble. | I have been trying to log in to my account for a week even after talking to support log in keep going to a change password when I do it tells me sorry check back later you would thunk a week would be sufficient dont dare to use card with no way to pay WHAT A JOKE FIX YOUR APP | It will no longer open on my phone | It's been so good to me | Thank you for very easy and understandable instructions! | Only allows 25 payees (billers) in Bill Pay check writing function. I have 61 payees, so I can't make payments to any that start with the letters T through Z, and only half of those that start with S.

I love how everything is together, less hassle | Using this app has been very intuitive and informative. It's a great way to keep track of the info I need. | Good place to store money. | The whole experience with getting the card and using it was awful. I called customer service right after getting approved to ask if my card could be expedited and was told that my card was already shipped only to receive a text after four days that they were just shipping the card. After receiving the card i tried adding it to my digital wallet. It kept giving me an error that my phone number was not linked to my account which was not true because the rep confirmed that my number was linked | Used to be decent but now it says my fingerprint updated several times a week and makes me relogin with my password. It'd be 5 stars if it weren't for this annoyance. | good card. thank you | This app is awful. I can never book any travel through here because there's always an error. | I can't use this app. For the last month or more every time I open it it just loads and loads for forever. Unusable. I have to go to the website to be able to see my account transactions and money. It is inconvenient and annoying. Please fix this app. And yes i checked for app updates there was none.

The jacks your credit up and down for no reason whatsoever. | Great Bank | Very satisfied with the app. My only ""complaint"" is that I can't pay a charge before it posts (early). | I like it because I can keep a check on my account plus I like the day early of your money hitting your account. I have not had any issues with my account so far. | Very easy to use. | Still my number one go to card. Easy to make my payments and rack up points..

It really helps for traffic. USE NOW! Great direction love this app. Use. U will fall in love with it. | Can no longer be trusted to give accurate arrival times. Often gives nonsensical driving routes. Used to be great. Not so much any longer. | Love waze! | Past few days the app has error, my home location suddenly changed and when tried to set it again app not accepting, uninstall and install again it remains same. Then keep uninstalled. | Great system | Great app, I use both Google maps and waze maps. | A couple of my last trips I was taken a longer, less direct way. I don't understand why I was taken in a big circle last time. Also, when finding a specific address, it doesn't tell me which side of the road it's on. I've been very disappointed and have turned off the app and gone to another. | rating | Nice when you know how to use it | This ap is just awesome | Good for freeways | Purple street names block the route exits using android auto, there really needs to be a option to disable these! | Very good | Not really working and feels like a beta. No audible alerts for speed, speed cameras, etc seem to work. There is a long history of internet posts about this. Seems it never gets fixed and I have to assume it's just a buggy app. Why on earth anyone would want to share their location with other users I have no idea but you can't add pothole, or other kinds of alerts unless you chose to appear on the map. All feels a little childish. A sat nav is not a social network. | Ok | Great when i first got it but now... Needs a save location when you point on the map! Took me 30 minutes to figure out the save location is in the preview first then you can save, also its now changing my saved addresses to random locations and I have to add the location and save it again I don't know why but waze has started becoming annoying and unreliable. | Maganda gamitin madaling intindihin | Imbis na may malapit na ruta palalayuin kapa | Waze is really helpful with warnings of traffic, roadworks and obstacles ahead. Warning sounds could be user selectable. | Can you add Avoid Road With Police 👮🏿‍♂️? Option? Maybe? | App crashes every day now I literally almost lost my job being late because of this app it crashes mid drive or doesn't work for hours at a time I've used it for years and getting ready to be done with it if they dont fix it | it's a great app but custom voices top working after I upgrade to a newer version. | apahal payah sgt nk dpt gps skrg ni..manjang loading jer gampang.....😡😡😡😡 | This is the best map because tell us roads line by line avoids from the havy traffic tell us about camra radars tell us about accidents on the roads I like this map 😊👍😊👍😊 | Very helpful for being able to look up directions that include traffic for future trips. I also love telling people about speed traps, road hazards, etc. Appleaps and Google maps do not streamline that as much. Oh! And customizing the voice has helped me miss turns less. It's perfect as is but if it would allow the screen to turn 180⁰ it would be extra perfect. My z flip has a magnet case that connects to a handsfree car holder but always flips upside down. | Rearranging all my addresses for some reason. Mislabeled. | Maganda ang waze basta marinong kang gumamit di magsisi kasi matagal ko nasyang ginagamit sa lahat ng pinupuntahan ko ok naman basta maayus yung magkaka lagay ng location at nasa tamng setting un puputahan dapat kong dadaan ka ng tolgate dapat na active ganun din sa service road para dka naliligaw sa pupuntahan mo..para sure kong ka ni wase dadalhin kya kayong gagamit ng wase basta ok un paggamit kay waze good po sya sa pupuntahan mo at walang hasel at sa experience ko maayo naman good na good | It's a good program for what it is. Had random issues with Android Auto at times, especially when using wireless AA. My biggest complaint is the dumb previous trips woodpecker that opens every time the app starts now and has to be manually closed. No reason this should not be toggleable for those who don't want it. | Downloaded voices not working in new android phones | Excellent app. Told me there was a police car ahead and where potholes were so to avoid them. Navigation is clear and easy to see and turns announced well in advance. Also warn about traffic cameras. Very happy with it. | Seems to navigate ok but makes my phone run very hot. I don't know why this should be because my other satnav runs quite cool. So I will be uninstalling it. Also it's no good if you are in an area with no phone signal. My other satnav downloaded the maps during installation. | Make it easier to add stop when planning a drive. April 23 2024 2021 review - Can't check routes for traffic or car accidents before I take them doesn't let me modify fireroutes for the way I want to take And also shuts off constantly mid route | The ability to preview navigation voices is a basic feature, which is not available in Waze. | Cant drop a pin and set that as a destination while already searching for a destination. Kind of an important feature when navigating through places that have inaccessible roads due to vehicle checkpoints/inspections kinda ruins it for me | Multiple route options with better accuracy than Google maps, even in small towns. | Doesn't work on android auto | Nice app | Useless | Okay | The app is so laggy I can't even search or use the saved location in my account. It will take time to start a new drive too when I finally get to work 😔 | Poor map display.inaccurate location. keeps telling no gps signal while there is.. No satellite display.. | good job. it's only confusing about the round about direction. cn u mke it simple by saying turn left or turn right! dt mke sense.just like goggle maps.,cn u put an off line maps navigation to ur apps. Dat will be great and appreciated by users. | It Does not show correct information on Fly over... weather to ride from Up flyover or Down road...Need to work on this... I am in India, Mumbai... | Ok | Please include pictures of buildings at destination like Google Maps. Also add PIP mode. | I have a Google Pixel 8 Pro and I did a fresh install with the app after seeing you could download custom voices. But no luck because the custom voice packs aren't working and I've looked everywhere but again no luck on a fix. | The app won't open after the last update. | What a disaster. Half the times it can't figure out the right way to get to a destination, and navigating the settings on the app require you to stop to make settings. Back to the best. .. Google Maps. | Easy to use | Doesn't show clean air zones and other routes round them | I would have gave him a five-star but I think they could do a whole lot better job on locating the police especially the ones that all the sudden get on the highway right in front of you or right behind you and there's no notice at all they give red light camera notices almost a thousand feet in advance so why can't they do the police other than that I use it everywhere I go | Not working | It's make us easier | No gps connection always show many places recently.. Not funny.. | Excellent app for everyday use | I would use Waze on my Android Auto all the time, but I don't like that Waze only shows the road you're traveling on behind the arrow only if you're navigating somewhere. Google Maps shows the road you're traveling on clearly behind the arrow at all times, not just when you navigate somewhere. I brought this up numerous times. Why can't you fix this, Waze? If you fix this, Waze would be 5 stars. | If it doesn't take you to the most unsafe locations, it will make you drive in circles. Nice 40km detour this morning just to get back on the same highway I was trying to avoid. Pity. The app has a potential, and it has nice user interface but it's unreliable and the routes are rubbish. Like my friends and colleagues, I'm deleting it. | Very good | According other user feedback, this is beta version, not public version. | Waze is not reliable and relevant, my destination is only 3.5km and the map show 13km route to the location. Terrible | amazing detailed street name its better than Google maps!! police warning etc I wish more poeple could use it!! we see farther on the map and they have more street name on it! speed limit too its genius! | Waze cannot links with GRAB DRIVER Apps? | Locking out the phone waze when it's connected to AA is just horrible compared to GM. Need to touch the car touchscreen search icon and handle the phone to type. User should be able to access the waze search and type screen, especially when first connected to AA when getting into car. This behavior should be like GM to make sense. | WHAT HAPPENED?!? This used to be good | Last update not working properly on samsung s22 ultra | I haven't used it. Yet. | Clear and concise directions. Driving in the roads that have various speed limits and, at times, are missing signs, the app is very helpful in showing speed limits. I love the police, construction, and stationery vehicles alerts. | The best way ever | Love the app but can you please add for us to note if a rest area is closed please & thank you | SNAFU, again! Since you've been messing with the app, I can't clear the ""where to"" dialog box on android auto. It blocks half the map! | After an update it can't open map forwarded via whatsApp. | Ok but seems very unstable, specifically with Android Auto. I see you reached out to me with a bad URL, so I looked in your site to provide more details about how your interface with Android Auto seems to randomly fail, lock, fail to clear overlays, fails to create a route from a memorized location...but your site doesn't have a way to provide that feedback. Do you really want feedback? If so, how do I provide that? | Please add Sheffield Clean Air Zone for 5* review! | very good | Lots of frustrating little things about this app that should've been fixed by now. It's also super frustrating that I have to close and re-open the app if I'm connected to Android Auto, or it won't let me put a new address in. Just let me use my phone however I want to use it. It's weird. | Won't work on my new phone TV | Find it very clear | Real time traffic very poor | Great | مثل همیشه عالی | After i insist on a specific route, waze changes it while im driving and got stuck in trafic. Why the hell you change the route when i insist on a diferent route? This is so stupid, sometimes it takes me off the main road and sends me to some horofic side routes. Stupid add i hate it, i use it just to see the police, otherwise is very bad route optimisation | actually bs app | Very good app | Refuses to verify the email account | Its a good application which give up to date information | There are some places it can't find & it eats allocated bandwidth like a hungry pig, but overall it's ok. I wish there was a way to add to the map though, where other people can validate if the info is accurate. The cosmetic changes aren't actually better than v3; in fact, they make the screen look so cluttered. It's not as intuitive as it used to be. Why make such a good app worse? Latest update messed up my saved places. | Access Contacts without permission !!!!!!! Why the displayable 'recent' list so short(22)? I'd love for 50 or more. Please allow settings for 'recent' list display: static or dynamic (you change it every couple years) | its ok for me the waze it gives accurate ways | Don't use this f...king app | I was on Google maps until a friend put me on to Waze. I now use Waze all the time. The alert of Potholes is brilliant, plus one can put them on the map. The whole Waze is great. | It be cool if I can choose satullight map display | 4 🌟 good navigation & live | Top | I was using this app, I got warned that it is hacking my system and sharing my data because the origin of this app, so simply I uninstalled it. | I feel like this app is designed for a 6 year old. No thanks | "" Waze Navigation: ALL'S GOOD 4SHO PEOPLE, 5 STAR'S PLUS AND MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED, GIVE ANOTHER 5 STAR'S PLUS SHO-NUFF Y'ALL "" !!! | add a feature to see your average speed in a speed camera zone 😀 | Great | Why my saved work place always change follow grab location previously not happened just few days","{""1"":690027,""2"":265235,""3"":383699,""4"":991617,""5"":6368037}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Waze","Waze","support@waze.com","http://www.waze.com","98 Yigal Alon

Transaction date is 3 Apr till now my amount of 5044 has not been refunded...... | App is easy to use and understand. | I love staying at an Airbnb over a hotel any time I travel, however the map and search filter has had flaws almost every time I use the app on both Android and desktop. Also, I recently had a minor disagreement with an Airbnb host and when I contacted customer support they simply blew me off and I was not asking for anything more than the host take down his false review of me as a guest. The policy says reviews must be unbiased and HONEST. This was not my experience. | This so-called Airbnb is nothing but a scammed. I would rather stay in a hotel moving forward. They don't care about people. All they care about is the money. I had a family emergency where I had to go to cancel our vacation. They said there were nothing they could have done...etc.. | I've used this app on many occasions, it's easy to use and I've never had any problems 👍 | Service is good app is awful. Can't sort order of results. Constantly has icon showing I have a message in my inbox. Generally very frustrating to use and laborious ... Bad UX. Just annoying. Makes me not want to use it. Simple things to resolv. ONE YEAR LATER: NOTHING CHANGED ITS EVEN WORSE WHY CANT I SORT THE ORDER OF MY RESULTS?? ITS SO FRUSTRATING, THE MAP DOESNT WORK. I MEED SOMEHOW CLOSE TO WHERE I AM AND CANNOT SEE | They only protect the host, not the renter. Our host claimed that we broke an EXTERIOR camera, which my kid found on the ground, and said the ""brand new"" air mattress didn't maintain it's shape, which they usually don't. When trying to communicate with AirBnB, all responses were generic and no concern for us. | Easy enough and found a place needed for time selected | Vacationing is awesome finding a home while away from home is priceless... | Awesome every time. | It is easy to use | We find some of the best places on here. | Easy to find what I'm looking for. Love the pictures to show the place. | Great experience | First time all good so far | Very easy to use, makes traveling super quick and easy | Nobody helps you when the situation at these houses and apartments turn bad!!! My family and I came to Miami and had nowhere to stay and they didn't want to give me a refund!!! None of the representatives speak English, so the experience has been terrible!! | Too many ad tracker signatures present in this app. | I love Airbnb. It is so easy to use and gives me peace of mind booking on this site. | Search feature is absolutely terrible. | I don't like that it resets your search if you leave the app for any reason. Other than that it's cool. | Great pricing!!! | Very helpful customer service | From the time i started airbn its stress free easy to access | Pretty good service and results | Amazing and fast | the service is great but the chat option is terrible in this App. typing and sending the messages In the messenger is very difficult. the keyboard covers the screen and I cannot see what I'm writing. the app needs improvement. looks like it is developed by bunch of amateurs | Use it often..delighted with results. | Airbnb app is easy and efficient to use. We have enjoyed the places we have stayed. | Great place to find great stays! | So far so good! There's been no issues whatsoever. | Fantastic | Well organised and optimised for travellers' needs | Awesome app shows you several different places.You can go the prices. | Great app | great | Easy to use | I have used Air BnB for years,and i really enjoyed it, BUT, the fees are getting out of hand. Please stop the bleeding! | Great app to book for trips | fun and easy to use! | Excellent! | easy and informative | Easy to navigate and great online experience | Airbnb is so out of touch with their hosts, they may as well be on Mars. I can only see 18 of my 40 listings. I can't share listing links, view or edit or do anything on the other 22 listings, unless I'm on a pc. It only shows 3 arrivals and departures a day, and you can't see tomorrow at all. But you get reminded of who's arriving in 8 DAYS every day!!! Co-hosts can't do reviews. Prices were randomly adjusted to base rate for the high season. (Even the feedback on this review is useless) | So far so good... Everything easy by online booking | Great | Worst customer support in muscat oman! They don't care about customer and even don't read your messages completely! I uninstall it now; 😔😔😔 | This app is not for India. They don't have support in India. Once you pay everything in advance. They reveal very pathetic places and once you contact support to complain they don't even bother to respond. The pictures of the properties you see in their app is totally different than real life. I had 2 very bad experiences: Manali and Wayanad. I am not going to use this application ever. It might work in other countries but it doesn't work in India. | Easy and friendly for first timer | Reliable | Great experience as ever. | Easy to use | Asking for verification when I've used Airbnb before, confused and can't complete booking. | Top | There seems to be dynamic pricing tracking me. It gives me a higher price than my friend. Boo. Lame. | Airbnb are crooks thieves stealing people's money by putting availability dates on rentals saying it's open when it's not I just rented with them for April 26 and 27 check out 28, I booked, when I booked the rental they changed the dates saying I'm renting on the 28 and 29 I have to work on the 29th is why I have to check out on the 28th if they would of put those dates as of not available I wouldn't have booked it, this is bogus what they did to me on a non refundable so they took my $$ | So far it's great, waiting for booking confirmation | 1st using is good enough | Excellent | Awesome | I've always a ys had great experiences using this app and renting from hosts. | Very easy and fun to shop for places to stay! | Why is it so hard to get approved on stuff it's like they want to make it difficult not want to work | Great gor all my vacation needs | Too many bad hosts, and scammers. Many dead listings. It used to be, maybe, one out of ten, but now it's like every other rez I make here leads to issues. What is even worse is, if I call their customer service, and complain about hosts lying, playing games, and incorrect info, etc, these ""ambassadors"" tell me I should think about how lucky I am to find a cheap place like that, and I should just suck it up, etc. 🤣 some ""ambassadors"" lie & deliberately waste guests' time. Worse than bad hosts 🤔 | Great app | User friendly & efficient! | Easy to navigate | Host public my personal id information at some Facebook group and airbnb support did nothing. Thanks for leaking my private information Update: you think I didn't contact support? I did and you ignored it | All very good and efficient. | The app is easy to use and convenient. | Serious GDPR concerns as wanting photo of ID and me, automatically saves payment details - doesn't give you an option to pay and not store. Very dissatisfied | User friendly! | Very reliable, fast and esay. I recommend to all for your booking. Thanks, Airbnb, for your trust and good communication. | Great | Registration process was a bit troublesome. Once you're in, no problems. | Enable the dark mode view. Nothing is visible. | Cool works for me | Always found a great choice of accommodation which has always been exactly as described, or even better. | Love Airbnb,,please stay for awhile!!! | Great | Have an issue with setting dates for my rent. System set me for 3 months instead of 1... can't fix it. Install few times, still have the same problem. | Customer service is lacking | Great | Awesome experience with Airbnb | I booked a room, the blankets were bloody. And the room is very dirty. I rented a house and then the host gave me another address. Another house that was cheaper!!! But at the same price as I had reserved. There was no hair dryer, cooking utensils, internet, etc. I sent a message to support airbnb . His answer was, did your problem with the TV get solved!!!!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 | Uwielbiam AirBnB. Przejrzysty interfejs i świetne oferty, nie wyobrażam sobie podróży bez tej aplikacji 😁 | Very good | Stayed in 11 BNB & it's been what was expected Each time. | Great way to travel, staying in local accommodation rather than touristy hotels and resorts | Funny and pathetic that this app cannot even recognise Indian voters ID card as a valid government proof. | Simplistic | Excellent | The search engine is ridiculous, when you move the map, some places on your screen just disappear, I don't know the logic on this search, but it definitely doesn't bring place focused on the map on your screen, any small movement new places appears and some disappears. Why don't just add the toggle feature to show all places for the select city, instead based on you screen??? | Gets me where I'm going | Excellent | I always find great prices","{""1"":123987,""2"":26203,""3"":32175,""4"":132913,""5"":1261285}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Airbnb","Airbnb","m.feedback.android@airbnb.com","https://www.airbnb.com/mobile",,"https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2855/","Airbnb","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1zfN_BL13q20v0wvBzMWiZ_sL_t4KcCJBeAMRpOZeT3p34quM-4-pO-VcLj8PJNXPA0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9ri0be3aHYM0rckVPIS8elcS7xMJegrrUrOJkQWawmmwdIfP6VH4ixkzY4HfN6vMsQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zvJrbFuTcSGP9INXCxcrcMqDOqiBLoA3zUG9Kel7AM2or_GoaNiXwYDkWQbq20F_ZJs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vJ_F0gP3MMLOw__izOqkxXZOzjfFQEMwVi5E6P4vcB0DjxCP5wCBR742jPdvgh-bjcI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mAnKL6-0rd9g0FReDLz0wpoYSI-pOaX9K_kTQulRcCz9r1cj9UNHhjOT1IZQxARAr3k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N6qpaH6bxxwXBKpPzd8O3Ht0ExI7_ObXAjtbbEB18gEMfZ_yaWsPLq63UZNvGpVgel0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QYur9zNMlF1tMIigPaoVfsCNCYmbCwu0EOUqYKMmeQJgKPSoDJGdD6nu8f-3KlarphY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pJR93DPZErFoCnZmwmTcyrs5nMsvfC1mL1XMRwBTZOEXOXkg5ca8_GsufLhpmwxqig"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Idk88QsDYi7Ae_Rcfrl0BO2_7LzztLQMNNWAj67H1CZuc7sbRyMGWdtNfTHyVCsTvw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IFQ-lObgWca2fx1xzEO6w72pue3pSKMrmoBDWlSoIdLY74hAfwMPShd7Seq91v0QFA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/v0Y23Jptlr33rghsctuOQID4do6WrjdAtvs76diG-5Y2Uoy_zJfzKaujDDCxM8QByNr1"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TtX9YSX0wwwW0ZeA2lgoQQuf-l_wdkoGFlmWfpfOkvtojiOy39eAV1Y2WxtfmbYUHzo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zcHl8ki0zvoFOds7thaDKP21BCw_i1y_p6hPHs-9z-XMf6u6BV4nIK7LHkJJ-0FTRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gObbi16HWxJ2fo8-wwSN0dsuYKmb7UvVAIGmfZRtQFLAlUTXauISGx7-e0gpHDwjHhs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7RPolDt0WnJ1QJv8fi4S9R7HIgfEjp_wTGN4Wxa0M6TriYKO0ISmFulSNm-_cW33dEDh"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fM8CmHzylnAh-c0lwutaf5I6-4HyDNfzN0xM-wBrTWTWQrZRmMA9YuNMeolu29Lrxg""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Jan 17, 2012",1713555093000,"24.15.1",,"[null]",false,false,false,"com.airbnb.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.android&hl=en&gl=US"

Truly do get the cash out with this game!!! | Great app. Lots of cool and fun games. It can be confusing when you 1st start playing, but I have found that once you figure it out it's pretty good. | Reacing to Msss a you lin c m | so far it's OK | Got enough points to redeem a $10 card for PayPal then when it kept crashing and saying there is a ""bug"" over and over again so I tried an Amazon gift card and it just crashes every time you go to confirm you're a real person. Don't waste your time with this like I did. | I bought my gift card then they put my account on hold and wont unblock | Games are great great rewards having fun love the game fun | Fairly easy to earn your first gift card. After that it takes longer to earn gift cards. | 27/4/24 It's genuine, I take a £10 Amazon voucher about once a month. Don't expect to make a living out of it, just a nice reward for your down time. No new games for a few weeks now. Promising ""exciting upgrade"" so waiting to see what's coming. | I have had this app for about 2 years or longer and it's the best for payouts! Great selection for games! | slow to earn but i liked it before. now the tracking isnt working. I actually got 2 $15 rewards though. I'm amazed. | Love this app! | Great fun and rewarding | Awesomely fun. | The app works. It takes a long time to make any amount in gift cards. Unless you download a new game everyday. Then with each game get to maybe checkpoint 5-7, and move on. If you do this you can accumulate lots of mist play points, which then transfer into gift cards! | Very functional and beneficial! | it's super fun. but I've played this game and others and never been paid real cash. | Nice having all my games in one spot. | It's fun 😁 | good selection of games, just really hard to get enough points for payout | I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM COLLECTING MY GIFTCARDS!!! I've played several other apps like Mistplay, some were hard to get paid. Some i never did. With Mistplay, you get paid for time playing, not for reaching milestones. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! 4/27/24: still playing and very satisfied. Thank you Mistplay!! | Getting paid to play games...Who wouldn't..... | I got 2k not scam GYAATTTT | This is a great application to earn pay pal money in a fun and simple way | Awesome | Out of all the apps that I use to make money. Mistplay by far is the best and the only app that I've used that I can make more than a dollar. I've literally made a lot of money through this app. I love it.. | Everything is good now and working properly,thank you. | awesome game selection love the rewards and promotions | really very easy to earn $$ | yay gift cards | gift cards are for real. I have won a bunch of them. | Sometimes you get the points you earn and sometimes you don't. I played the game I tapped on the choice and it brought up the game and I started playing, and I played for sometimes an hour sometimes too and that should have given me the 20-minute plane and sometimes I play after midnight for after 11:00 I should say and it doesn't give me any credit for either one of those things the 20-minute play or the after 11:00. This is now happened three times so there is a glitch. | So far so good 👍 | I love playing games and earning gift cards. | Mistplay is great. There is a lot of fun games and you really do get gift cards for playing. I recommend this app. | When I tried to sign in to misplay it just said error . I have tried every thing I have tried to reach out to misplay but nothing and I have never use this app so why does it says that somebody have use my email or username which it did not let me use a username | I love being paid to play the games ❤️ | I love the game but I wish there were more boosted games to earn points quicker because it does take awhile to earn enough to get gift cards. Best part is you really do get real gift cards!! | slow to earn credits to buy anything, but eventually getting paid for gaming is kinda fun | Best app ever 💯 | Love this app. I've earned a bunch of gift cards playing games I totally enjoy. If I get to a level I can't get past, I uninstall it and choose a new one | really pays and fast this is legit and love the games took two weeks to get a $10 BK gift cart playing in spare time | yeah | A load of toash and get is it take 3 months to get 5£ try the rubbish | Love it | It's Actually Legit,, I've Cashed Out a Few Times Already Just Playing Games I Enjoy 😊 | to be honest the ads for it aren't the best but it's no lie, I don't do the gift cards I do PayPal and so far I've made around $100. it helps with gas and or groceries | Mistplay banned my account right when I redeemed my 10 google play giftcard. Pure scam | I have made a couple hundred dollars so far. If you're going to play games you may as well earn money while you do it. This app actually pays and it doesn't take forward to make money or receive your money..I love this app..the best one I've tried by far! | Definitely a favorite gpt game hub. The best out there, look no further! | love the app! was skeptical at first but it's a great way to play games and earn real rewards, plus it's also introduced me to some games I ended up loving ❤️ also really good customer support when needed! Would definitely recommend this app! | love it when I needed diapers and was out of money i cashed out and was able to get them I really find it useful | If I could give more stars I would!!! Very easy to download games and earn units for rewards, I've gotten probably $350 in gift cards since I started playing over a year ago and the few times I had an issue, customer service exceeded my expectations and I'm very greatful!!! Definitely recommend this app!!! | Be lazy, get paid, watch ads, have fun. ... it works Get a friend on board to get the friend bonuses and play together 👍🏼 | I've been waiting on an Amazon card for a long time. I just ordered another. We will see if I get either one. | love playing game in my free time and earning gift cards! | so far, fantastic. no reason not to download, | Takes too long to earn gift cards. | Played for years and now can't even get logged in | Awesome site. Great rewards. Is it 100's of dollars a day? No..But it is a month. It's great for spending at online retailer's without having to put in your cc info. It's a win win!! | love this app and the rewards! | I have been using Mistplay for a good while now. I have found several enjoyable games through the app and have topped up my google account with rewards multiple times just from gameplay. The rare times I have needed support I actually got it pretty easily and my issues were resolved to satisfaction quickly. | Fun for the most part, and you actually do get money, but the game type that you download the most seem to start being worth less, or they don't have games in that section anymore. | Like the variety of games. | Good little side earner | love this... | Awesome way of earning giftcards. Wish the boosted games actually switch up every 24 hours. | Since I joined, the games aren't any good anymore. The units have decreased a lot that you earn. Use to be able to get 4 or 5 units per game. It didn't take long to earn gift cards. Now the most you can get is just one unit. It takes a long time to earn any gift cards. | it seems pretty fun | The only app I've been on where you actually get the rewards without any ""line ups"" that never end. | I think the prices in the gift shop is a little high especially since they've gone up, gift card prices aside I love mist | LOVE THIS GAME | really awesome I have earned dozens of gift cards quick, fun and easy | Works great, but does take a little time to build up points. I mostly play the boosted games (which helps the speed). in 3 weeks, I've received a total of $45 in Amazon cards. redeeming them was easy. Update 4/2024. I'm still using this app. Payouts have never failed. I've lost track of my total Amazon gift card payout but I am days-a week away from a $100.00 card. | awesome platform to get paid to play the games you play anyway!!! | yea I till people all the time | you get actual rewards | some fun games but no high wins as promised in advertisement. small wins but they take forever to accumulate . | It's very good, no issues so far, and I almost got my 10$ gift card. It's a very good edit: got 10$ google Play gift cards, very good works 100% | This game actually pays it's so easy to earn the points and they have awesome gift cards and many gift cards to pick from. You won't go wrong with this app!!!! | Great variety, quick cash out. Daily bonus | Hi i have been having issue loading this app. If it wasnt for this problem i would og given Mist play 5 stars. Help | Getting into some wonderful games. Wish things didn't cost so much for multiple games. But you earned 5th star. However, I AM having an issue of playing dice dreams and launch from mist, but doesn't keep track. Sometimes mist shuts down and not aware that not registering. | So far, so good. Will update in a week. | Best cash app of them all. I would give Mistplay 10 stars if possible. | Put my account on hold after I earned a gift card. I'm not going back to it | Great games | Best game pay app ever!!!!!!! | Has the most annoying ads that will interrupt you at every moment. Seriously reconsider this app. Edit: in response to the their marketing team's asinine response, this app has the most annoying ads that make me hate their services. No matter what game I play, the mistplay app pops up. Unskippable ads with tiny x buttons that send me to their app page instead of closing their damned ad. Again, they have the most annoying ads with annoying nasally voiceovers. | This is have emojis I've seen it long time😡 | good little app | Fun and easy way to earn gift cards | Love mistplay happy to win gift cards. when you play the games and do the tasks. | I've been using this for a few years and it has helped me so much, I love this app","{""1"":54921,""2"":12777,""3"":21169,""4"":48514,""5"":318814}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","MISTPLAY","MISTPLAY","contact@mistplay.com","https://www.mistplay.com","481 Viger Ave W

I would definitely recommend this app. | Needs way to much access to your personal information | It's good because you could order everything | Service not satisfied with | Excellent service from start to finish would highly recommend again could not fault anything | Probably the most useful app I have on my phone haha | Precise and on time | Great for both shopping and tracking packages. | Good app sometimes doesn't register the delivery and I have to do it myself but all in all a good app that puts all your orders in one place. | Love how it gives me a full detail nap of my delivery progress!! 💯💯💯 | I have struggled to get a refund from a fraudulent seller on the platform. The app seems to operate effectively for honest buyers and sellers, but I can find no support from the platform for bad transaction, except for a circular set of irrelevant help center articles. | Easy tracking experience. | Really love this app | Works great when it actually lets me pay for what I want. The captcha fails to function properly and my card declines when I have more than the necessary funds required to purchase. | No problems at all 👍 | Love watching my Packages tracking on Shop. | Great order tracking, and updated me Everytime the product changed locations. Very well organized and easy to use! | It's more storefront than tracking packages. Now if you want to track all of your packages, you gotta scroll and find it. There's no icon at the bottom to make your life easier. The amount of clutter on the homepage makes your nauseous. Other than that, it gets the job done if you're tracking multiple packages. | It is so helpful to keep track of my orders. | Nice to track your orders all in one place. | It's accurate and reliable, thx | I wish it would come earlier instead of 7:00 | The backpack cooler I ordered was exactly as described. And it was a shipped on time. | Shop is great for tracking all of your different orders from all over the internet. | On point | Follows al my packages and orders well. | It's an alright app, good for tracking my packages, but everytime I try to order something, my check out page says a certain code is not applicable to my cart, even though i haven't put in a code. Even after undownloading and re-downloading it's still like this. | Love it ,it help out so much knowing when your package is coming. | Awesome 👌 | Great app for keeping all your e-purchases together. I wish I could permanently set the currency to CAD, but other than that. Great app! | Logo just spins and never opens | Shop is the best. Use it. | 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😁 | Very very professional service | This Is My First Time Using Shop™ And Everything Went Well. I Love How Everything Is Well Organized. Even Having A Third Party Page Link, So You Can Get An Actual ETA On Your Items. The Location Map Graph Is A Little Off, But Besides That. Tap Into Shop™. | Works both ways | Excellent App! Fast and easy Way to track your personal treasures! | Excellent | Great app | Let's me easily track and keep up with purchases I've made and makes checking out super easy. Probably the most useful app I have on my phone. | I love you guys are very great, Thank you so much l appreciate you, l love Shop | I'm grateful | Shop has become my go too hub for monitoring incoming shipments. Easy to use, plenty of information to keep you updated, accurate. I dont even use all of its capability and it's still the best tracking app out there. | Fast shipping good help | Shop is handy for keeping me in the loop on my merchandise I order online. | I like how visual this tracker is, and that it centralizes a lot of my online order shipments. I also can have updates routed to my kids when I order something for them. | Informative | Always deliver on time and with security | Great app | Great notifications about packages. | Nice app good on tracking package | app is frozen and when i uninstall and redownload, it keeps saying installing... | I love using this app to inform me of when my items will arrive and tracking them here is a God sent . | Very good | I have seen nothing but good things from Shop. Keep up the great work. | No more wondering when your package will arrive. | Very professional | This is a very useful app especially if you use the payment plan program. Plus able to use some of the money that you get back as it multiplies through a wide variety of shop is a really useful and a bang for your buck | Awesome app shows all deliverys from different places plus shops you can buy directly from | Love this app | Great App!! Helped track most of my purchases easily. | Excellent app. Very happy with it | Very timely!! Great way to track everything in one place!! | App gets cute with its stupid animations. I thought my package arrived and was scrambling outside but it was still in transit. Tone down the quirkiness Millenials! | Handy little app for sure. | Very reliable on tracking orders! All except for Amazon which is fine, since Amazon has in app tracking as well as Best buy! Used shop for about 4 years roughly now :) | Have not received my order and no way to track it. | Excellent | Seemed to work fine | First purchase made through was a scam... as soon as payment posted the store was gone. | Best app ever simple to use can track all my packages have no issues love the recommendations it gives | Very easy to track my orders | It's a bit slow at letting you know it's arrived | Happy with everything | This is one effective app! Wow, it's a hassle free and safe tool to stay on top of orders. I always know where orders are in the shipping process and trust them to get things done! Keep up the good work, I think I'll keep you lol. | I purchased something from a company literally 3 weeks ago and have not gotten it yet. I tried to contact customer service. They send generic letters each time. Now the company that I purchased through is saying they delivered my item when they delivered it to Georgia and that is not the state that I live in. I almost feel like they must get a cut from selling stuff and do not care whether these companies are real or not. The lack of customer service is really frustrating. See their ""help"" below | easy pay for my piggy services | Very helpful when checking out from online stores. And helpsnkeep track of my packages and let's me know when they'll arrive | Trustworthy and handy app. Nice to know my info is safe and be able to see all my orders in one place rather than having to check several sites individually. | Did not like the store at all. The app works as it should I guess, but the service sucks. The only reason I downloaded it was because I needed to track a purchase. My purchase took over two weeks to arrive when in their website it says they operate out of California. That may be true, but the product comes directly from overseas, perhaps China. And why does the app need permission to go through my emails? I don't understand. Not satisfied. | All my orders in one place!! So great! | Offering parcel tracking as an enticement to get me to download this hot garbage might work if the tracking worked. It doesn't. One second directly on their website does. Avoid. | Really good, wish it was for all of my deliveries. | Some scam sights on here make it less safe and good but still very useful | No shipping details and the number is not available. | Every time I have used this app has been positive. I get tracking updates which I appreciate. | Clearly | I enjoy from time totime | Easy to use | Very helpful app! Could track my parcel down all the way to my doorstep! Love how easy it was to use | Very reliable! | Awesome 100% | A very useful app indeed 👍 | Great App | 💥 Connect to Amazon is FINALLY Working❗ For everyone like me that's been trying sporadically over the past month+.... I was finally able to RE-connect my Amazon account to track packages!!! - That was super frustrating - especially because the app was constantly nagging me to reconnect. - Hopefully this issue has been fixed for everyone else too!! 🤞😘 - . - . - . - . - .- .- . - - .- 🤮🎀 ☠️🦇 | Outdated disaster. No idea why they have option to ""report"" wrong info if they don't even pay attention when you select them. Missing a lot of carriers. Customer service non existent, spent 1 month showing errors with images and nothing got fixed go figure. It will pick 1 out of 20 Amazon packages ( sucks ) can't have other email aside from Gmail and Hotmail besides the Amazon account. Just pathetic having to manually add tracking. 🤦🤷. Bottom line. STAY AWAY FROM THIS 🗑️ | Does what is should and does it well, at least in terms of tracking packages.

My big complaint is the price, $19.99 is more than I pay for any other streaming service and I can't justify the cost with these films. So I'm willing to watch the ads to get free episodes, but its hell getting back to the show after the ad is over.

Can't rely on only carrying the phone for payment. | I love this keep u updated 💯❤️ | Awesome | I wish | All is good,I like it,my wife likes it to | Nice | Ok | No longer works on TFL. seems to be an issue with pixel 7 and last Android update. pretty poor really | No funciona en mi telefono y no me permite borrarla! | Up until about a month ago, I had no problems ever with this app when paying anywhere. Now, it won't go at all. Nothing. And there's no reason for it to stop working. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it, taken off my card and put it back in. Nothing. Nada. Honestly, at this point I'm done and not even anything in help forms are close to being helpful. | For Hongkongers, now using your Android Phone to use Octopus | CNt get approval of lost cards if on another lost phone | Thankfully they are good 💯 | Great | Not working at all | Cannot pay without pin now | pay | New for me. Sounds good. | 🙄 | Ok | Tried linking my PayPal card to Google pay and it refuses to allow me to use my card - the one thing this is app is meant to do. When trying to use the card through Google pay it asks to verify but will not accept my details and I have checked several times to ensure every single detail is correct but yet I still cannot pay. Trash app that does not work for online purchases, can't wait till everywhere accepts PayPal so I never have to think about Google pay again. | Don't care for it | App will fail purchase and ask me to confirm my identity with fingerprint unlock after I've already unlocked it to get into the app to begin with. Causes the payment to fail at the terminal. Really obnoxious. | 👍😊 | does not work | Decent basic functionality, but the UX is severely lacking. Every time I want to reorder cards or perform basic tasks like updating the card expiration date, I end up spending an excessive amount of time trying to figure out/remember how to accomplish the task. For an app with fairly basic functionality, I'm not sure how anyone managed to make it so complicated to accomplish simple tasks. Also, no Home Key, driver's license, power reserve, or other functionality to compete with Apple Wallet. | Having some issues with the tap to pay. The fingerprint scanner or the pin lock should come up right away instead mine won't come up till after you touch card reader the first time then it comes up. Then it gives me trouble | good | Useless. Wont start. Just says chose an account to use and gets stuck | Had a problem but google immidietly suggested the fix. Cool! | Better | it is very hard to get my payment to be accepted | Stopped working, says my cards are no longer available. | Like it | L, | Does not take all Mastercards. | Very bad experience. | The new verification feature is probably the worst update you could have done I am thinking on not using the app anymore just because of it | Never used | Use to be fine, but now asking for verification every time you use it. Might as well just use your card, much faster at checkout. | After updating all my cards were deleted, was in a grocery store when i found out and had to drive back to get my actual card | Scamware, keep out!!!!! | Awesome, Great, Superb | Works great on my Samsung S8. Edit\ Great on a S10. Edit\ Still working as I'd expect on S22. | Why does I need to put in another PIN when performing a payment, even when my phone is already in an unlocked state | Works well for me! 😊. Feel very comfortable using it and very secure. But, I FAIL to see the bad feedback? Oh well, just goes to prove the old saying? You CAN fool some people SOME of the time? I detest Apple and a fast sinking Microsoft myself! Both wanted to take over the world. Selling second rate phones at an inflated price?? Free OS software that was VERY buggy & written!? But MOST PROBLEMS are USER or PHONE faults!? But people still blame the Apps?? WHY?? Oh well...You can fool some... | Good | It's was working before but now is not working on my redmi note Pro I don't know what happened l was thinking maybe my card is the problem l want to capitec bank the said my card is working there problem is Google wallet? The said Google wallet can help me with this problem cause l was using before with the same phone 😕😞 | No longer working, too many bugs since the last update, it used to work with minimal problems, I've removed the app & all it's folders then installed a fresh download but the same problems with it not working as it did before, the app keeps asking for my finger print & then verification over & over in a loop & does not pay, I'm now uninstalling & using my card, this app is not worth the trouble, looking at the reviews everyone who has this app is having problems & it's not being fixed! | Stupid!!! I cant even get it to work it won't go passed the select google account and open up. I have found out it has a transfer funds option and I added google Gcard to wrong account and can't use them for the games i play now and the wallet had never opened on any of my Samsung phones S20 FE .S22 FE . S23 Ultra or Pixel 8 Pro | Okay thanks | Google wallet or Google pay? | It's good. And it's easy to use it. | It's convenient and very useful specially when I'm doing online shopping. | Latest change - have to pin or print unlock the phone for nearly every tap payment. Makes every simple transaction more complex. Sucky move google. Google wallet. Australia. | Awesome. Easy. Convenient | Loads USA cities for transport when everything I can see in my settings say Australia. Totally frustrating 🤨 | Has started enforcing fingerprint moments after I already unlocked the phone to pay, as of this week. Even for $3, though Google documentation says Australia's maximum is $100 before fingerprint required again. Give me back control over how I manage my own money and device. Rubbish company. | You might as well use your card as you have to put a pin in and retap to make a purchase. | Awful to try to edit. Do not recommend | Required to have a pass code | I use zip pay and afterpay in my wallet, it doesn't work at some stores. Even removing and re adding | Ok | something has changed and I have to.try 2 or 3 times to pay for things, every time using my fingerprint or pin code even when Ive unlocked previously very frustrating 😕 | Easy to set up and use | Can't log in | verygood and easy to use | Doesn't work. Go to pay and nothing. Cards all installed but still won't tap. Submitted 2 reports and still quite on googles end. Have a brand new pixel 8. No reason it shouldn't work | Well | Automatically charges my card if there is any Tap to Pay within a foot of me, without confirmation and without the app being open. If I unlock my phone in the vicinity of Tap to Pay machine it just automatically charges my card and there is no way to turn it off without turning off wallet payments entirely. | 1. when I chose to pay using card A, but turns out it's using card B?? 2. when I delete a payment method from Wallet, it's still there. | Google home, wallet, etc. Are NOT at all good anymore. | Tap ❤ | can't see my balance | Everything is good and my new 🆕 are really nice | good | Useful to pay for things but also useless. Tried numerous times to remove a payment card. No steps to explain how to remove the card. Didn't want to link it to the email. Had to uninstall and reinstall. The card is still there. So I uninstall and not use that app til Wallet developers find a way to delete a card. Swiping left doesn't work. Thumbs down. | Good | Don't use | Awesome 💯 | Stops working out of nowhere really anoying sometimes | It was fine until a week ago. Has now stopped working and/or asks for verification id at every attempt. Frustrating as I've changed nothing. Looking for alternatives now. | Basically it's own dead end security structure , strategies. | Fjrhifhid v kegs | Doesn't work when launched from Firefox. I tried to use the the Google Pay button to pay on the uci cinema website from Firefox and I received a message in a Google Page stating that I had to use either Chrome or Safari. | Intermittent when working since the last update, worked yesterday then today shows a security issue, then reboot the device and wallet works. Use to work constantly. Please revert the recent update until a fix has been released. | I never got to the part that explains how it works. | This app was so amazing...I never carried cash or cards..it was amazing and I was recommending it to everyone until two days ago..all of a sudden it stopped saying Google wallet in not allowed in south Africa,theny phone does not have enough security or something...I was so dependent on this app as a form of payment that it left me stranded in the middle of purchases with people frustrated and annoyed with me in line | No longer works since verification introduced. Unreliable, frustrating and embarrassing. A real backwards step. More feedback: when using my phone to pay at shops, I present my fingerprint to unlock and place next to card reader, my phone locks and asks for fingerprint again and again and again. It goes into this loop and does not pay! | This app is a freaking joke so my phone came with it downloaded on here so I put my credit card information in my debit card information on the wallet but when I go to pay for stuff it doesn't work it don't make no sense because it says that you know like it needs an NFC and every time I go in the settings on the top right corner for the wallet I don't see no NFC to turn on so I'm so confused because like where is the button at and then I look at the reviews and I see that client said the new up | Perfect | I tefuse to use this. I 'Will Not' allow Google to access any financial matters, and playstore does not offer an uninstall option. google auto updates are turned off too. | Mines crashed. Unable to open. Messsge says 'There was a problem setting the active account' . | makes going to events super easy when all you need is your phone | cant use the app, saying verify its you, when I do that nothing happens and is stuck in a loop of asking me to verify, I cant pay for anything in the last week | Do not know how many updates ago it was broken, but as of 29 mar 2024, wallet is crashing every time I swipe to change a card. UI is now broken too - does not work at all in dark mode (black letters on a dark grey background), and the font size is tiny and cannot be changed anywhere in the app (e.g. in the activity list, and many other places). The only way I could read anything at all was to use another phone camera as a microscope. Watch version of the app still works fine, thankfully. | Sometimes CBA Mastercard transaction won't go through.","{""1"":145621,""2"":41781,""3"":80509,""4"":154074,""5"":1140384}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Google LLC","5700313618786177705","google-payments@google.com","https://pay.google.com/about","1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043","https://policies.google.com/privacy","5700313618786177705","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DHBlQKvUNbopIS-VjQb3fUKQ_QH0Em-Q66AwG6LwD1Sach3lUvEWDb6hh8xNvKGmctU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wHPP4mjBRywNkDOJ-6IpdI2H39buQ8OhfScYc7oNMLyedctH-U8m5Rjk2YDMRytb6ZI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xWmsRbqQJUPLkVzjQSKtMHs_OO3uzaucj-nofyu6z3wH5Yk8qkOPvWngpfRQUaE2WiQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-7MXU92VBf_SRiD7xG9XI7JoZzpv8-0OCN2xNLMT4SHx7f7hVwCKnA1louSmEvB6zQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bAjZhhMvAikTsRxlrBQ53zlAEHy60zaFINewyd21CFR2wbLCMUIMdNvrtCMIAtJYpQo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oEBcFE3vI_lWARhA9i-kYhAbpm90VbqXN8JB4IutM3jWXxV5F1kKhKyhy3hnCcCDTg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UfFCFUmQA7F7-Ecl6WQ3ypik83LpsDspGvmIQNtgQl9M-k4IOimqTLIuel5PwkMfL_Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/i2e1t1Z1_ltBixQ_898iGEUdpQK2IBxnHtGd7Bci_pz8KfY2TPabhyEYaDfOMDT1NFc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W8LfDF-728ZlihFjv9ZWPV8yYeaZxFPDZam58H-_6pVVi2Bg6iRWcS0k9gWelvpWpu-d"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8vKc5TccVqIgyWhEpTFUYhTkY-5d9XpFzi1ZLKkxy5zSlBe8dKzuH3aJnG7NH8DFug"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0MemXwmFGX553raLXC9frvHmPBiIPtjdFjYdae6vl87_2zkyfIsYvImvYiidPjxDYycL"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WcVw0lpI3QvA0uWw4toAGRJ6MO3IubdyD0CffjYr1LDw7NbVwShKbst7YiaNA6k6iAFo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7BfsnKcWqrM-Snl8uYEYZEPNUeDkRr7aOm1D4XMWMoNxKTrKNWgVmtzxnunqGjeNXmI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J3QNC_EFBi_qgxddGvkz5RpgIXgwg6cizM9y6wbHB3q0xINxqNHuYPHjb-6lQGFvoL3A""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Jun 24, 2011",1713371447000,"VARY","• Keep everything protected in one place, no matter where you go with the new Google Wallet.<br>• Enjoy faster, safer, easier access to essentials like your payment cards, loyalty cards, concert tickets and more – all from your Android phone.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en&gl=US"

A safer online experience for kids
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
Keep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
Blocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.
Flagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Create individual experiences as unique as your kids
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. 

Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.

All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids

"Move to iOS","Everything about iOS is designed to be easy. That includes switching to it. With just a few steps, you can migrate your content automatically and securely from your Android device with the Move to iOS app. No need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. The Move to iOS app securely transfers all kinds of content data for you:

Contacts
Message history
Camera photos and videos
Mail accounts
Calendars
WhatsApp content

Make sure to keep your devices nearby and connected to power until the transfer is complete. When you choose to migrate your data, your new iPhone or iPad will create a private Wi-Fi network and find your nearby Android device running Move to iOS. After you enter a security code, it will begin transferring your content and put it in the right places. Just like that. Once your content has been transferred, you’re ready to get going. That’s it — you can start using your new iPhone or iPad and experiencing its endless possibilities. Enjoy.","Everything about iOS is designed to be easy. That includes switching to it.

Innitially it said it would take me 72 hours to complete my transference! Then I restarted and it said it would take me 18 hours, then it said it would take about 3, then it became 19 hours! This app is also really prone to erros and the time that it takes for the transference to be completed is an absurd! | How to make this | Really good | I am returning my iPhone because of my experience attempting to use this app. | Horrible app!!! Move to iOS struggles to get SOME of the data transferred. It fails miserably to get messages transferred from Google Pixel to iPhone. Group messages are unusable...it adds multiple people to the group. Other messages are incomplete at best. It's a horrible excuse for an app and makes the transition from Android to iPhone very difficult. Transferred messages are not searchable in the iPhone. You are better to start fresh and not transfer messages. | big good | Thank goodness, this process was easy | Not customer friendly | Disables Android apps without asking. After completing the migration Phone Link had stopped working and I had to reauthenticate my Android device for WhatsApp. Not cool, Apple. | I was extremely hesitant to move from a pixel phone to an iphone after I saw the mixed reviews for this app, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway, thinking it couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews said. But after transferring my data half of my contacts were merged into groups I lost a majority of my text messages, pictures have become a jumbled mess, and have completely wrong dates. I would strongly suggest looking into other options rather than risking your data by using this app. | Hey android I hope this is not goodbye how dare we downloaded this app am really sorry 😭 | I am unable to download the app | After hours of trying to get this garbage app to work, getting stuck at 1%, the transfer randomly cancelling, i had to leave my photos and videos on my android and EVEN AFTER THAT it was still buggy as hell. Funny how my worst app experience with an android was with an apple product | Buto lama babi sembang kata 30 minit last ii sampai ke 3-5 jam. Kalo setel tkpa ni transfer failed buto ☺️ | It's must to reset your iPhone to transfer whatsapp chat, must work on this make it more user friendly, it should be easy for user to migrate whatsapp chat | Great | Best app for data transfer from Android to IOS | Aliyusalisu | Ok | lousy | All apps | Does not work, waste of time | It doesn't show WhatsApp icon while transferring data. Another thing why Apple wants phone to be factory reset just for WhatsApp transfer?? Tired of transferring data from Android to iPhone 3-4 times & didn't get WhatsApp icon in transfer. | Doesn't work | Good app😫🥺💗💯 | Aplikasi sangat membantu untuk migrasi cuman yang disayangkan tidak support WA business dan aplikasi aplikasi tidak lengkap ikut terinstall padahal aplikasi terdapat di AppStore juga | Pathetic app | keeps restarting | Ok | So so so so terrible | amazing it worked on the first try! at first i was shocked but then i realised i downloaded the app | Will not transfer my photos correctly or text messages! | Not loading properly. It takes too much of time. | Good | Helpfull app☺️ | Wrost appp 3rd party app are better | Thanks so smart 🙏👌 | Progress bar does not work, so im expected to wait and hope that stuff is transferring. | Please add call logs option and increase the transfer speed | Horribly slow and keeps getting stuck for an Android to Ios move | I was trying to move data from my old Android because it was no longer charging. Apparently, some mongoloid at Apple decided a low battery must be charging for any data exchange to happen through this app. I absolutely hate Apple, which is why this is a backup phone, for this exact type of stuff they do. | Nice app | Mukesh muku | trying | I didn't know, I have to get an iPhone first to move to IOs?? taught is just install and set up alone!!? | Terrible. Doesn't work | It is so great! | Stuck at 48 minutes 😒 | Does iOS actually give you jobs and pay you the money that you deserve and earn in life? Or is it just a giant rip off like Android... | Good | It actually worked fine on the first try for me. I got my messages and photos. | Life is a teacher when you come over to Vietnam you learn more | My problem is I don't know password 🔑 what is password | Good | It can only move to erased iphone. Not as powerful as Samsung Smartswitch. | Terlalu lama menghubungkan padahal udah ada wifi tetangga tapi lama menghubungkan mohon diperbaiki | Move to ios Mistake ❌️ | I'm sorry android, thanks for the 12 years in my life.. but i'll move to iOS tomorrow. (also from what i hear its a very functioning and safe app!) | Screwed up my messages by adding unrelated people to conversations | Useless. Wanted to transfer apps from my S24 Ultra to my Iphone 15 Pro Max. Not even half of the apps got transfered. What was the point of it? Took forever too. Really useless... | HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME. spent half a day on it (8 hours) repeatedly trying to transfer over from my s10 to 15 pro, only for the est time to go up to 30 hours and not reducing at all. i tried to transfer only whatsapp as the only way is through move to ios, but timer always gets stuck at 1 min as what other reviews mentioned. gave up after more than 10 resets. im very disappointed in apple as I was looking forward to go back to IOS, please fix this issue. | Perfect solution | Fake App. This app not working 😕. | Good | Horrible experience | Recovery | K I need to get it same my iPad mac | Quick and easy | Bad it took loong | Bilkul 💯 Baqwas app hai ye | Great aap | It doesn't move my WhatsApp chats! The instructions to move WhatsApp from Android to iOS say to select the ""WhatsApp"" option from the list of things to transfer, but I don't get that option at all! I have the correct versions of Android and iOS that the app requires, so I'm stuck. | Decent | This app makes you truly regret moving to IOS. | 😁😁😁😁😁 | Not yet your life with the flow | Five hours then got stuck on 1 mintune. I have tried every single way possible but wasn't able to make it work. It used to be great but fully trash rn... | Set up an ipad air got as a gift, but the idea that the app is named Move to IOS, like nobody is going to use android again, is pretentious, so minus one star there. Then no selection of which apps to choose to copy over(not to mention some are not there in app store) was second bummer, so minus another there. Lastly, after the transfer, talks about I can recycle my android device (like no one can use both an android phone and an ipad) for free, was another pretentious word, worth minus one. | Photos and mesages all over the place if I wanted group chats would make em myself | Just great to use since it's been years changing my tablet to an iPad, I'm glad I did for this app moved it all for me! Thanks | Great and easy to use | My transfer for my phone wasn't too bad but my girls was taking about 20 to 30 hrs so honestly I'm just happy to see others are going through it too and not just us. | App works well, took an hour but I did have almost 30GB of pictures and videos taken with the camera and screenshots, so it's understandable. All the apps that I needed transferred over too. | Salazar p.o. sainyo at patuloy nyo p.o. gaming sinusuportahan po maraming Salazar p.o sainyo | This app is a complete disaster. This is why ppl do not want to move to apple. Did not transfer ANYTHING correctly to my new POS iphone 15 pro. Screwed just about every text message in message history. In multiple instances, it took the message history from what would have been 1 person and somehow said it was part of a group text of like 10 random ppl. Now my whatsapp is f'd. It didn't transfer the app, and infact, now it won't load the program on either phone. Fail | Why can't you people write instructions that are EASY to understand for us people who absolutley DETEST technology? I'm trying to transfer info from my LG6 Stylo phone over to a newly purchsed iPhone 14 Plus; don't have a clue what the heck I'm doing and am having absolutely no success with any of this. I really wanted to try an iPhone just for a change, and haven't quite given up yet, but I am having absolutely no success with any of this!!!!! Technology stinks! | This app is riddled with bugs that seem to be affecting every device. The calculation for estimating time can take an inappropriate amount of time, or never even progress. The estimated time to completion is very inaccurate and changes inconsistently. There is a bug where the transfer gets stuck at 1 minute on the apple device. Apparently all of these bugs have been around a really long time and haven't been fixed. The app is also somewhat slow, the transfer is crawling at best. | Junk apps👎👎 | Worked on my first try! All WhatsApp chats were backed up (with images) I had moved out media beforehand to decrease transfer size to 1gb. Took 1 hour to finish. Make sure your phone display timer is set to never so it's easier. Once the process starts, do not touch both phones. I kept them next to each other and only kept checking that they were awake. I first selected WhatsApp and then contacts and messages (nothing else). Exchange the sim once transfer is complete. | Tidak keluar pilihan WhatsApp saat mau transfer data | it's very nice..... 😍❤🙌 I'm really very happy with this app 🙌❤ | Worst garbage ive ever used.Does not work,literal waste of my time. | Good work | I read so many reviews saying it wouldn't work that I was very skeptical. Thankfully though, transferring from my s21 ultra to my iPhone 14 plus worked. It took a while, and the estimated time froze at 8 minutes for like 20 minutes, but then it finally started counting down again. I'm so relieved that it worked. I almost bought a license for one of those shady apps, but I'm glad I tried this first. I had to leave a review to make sure people just follow the instructions. | good | Nice | Doesn't do one fin thing it says it does correctly. | Trash | Quite literally the worst thing I've had to go through. I tried about 5 times didn't work. Kept on gettin stuck and not moving.

When a driver has given me the wrong food or has not delivered at all but claim they have. I have received a refund back from Uber eats. They also set a pin that needs to be given to the driver for future orders. | Food yummy, now food comes to me. | Good app | can you stop with the add after I've already ordered? so grubby | Good service and great offers | They allow their drivers to disrespect their customers. Throw paid for food into the streets and refuse to compensate for the mess that is their own. Their drivers don't know how to read and keep trying to deliver my food to a road that isn't even written on the information and no matter how many times I point this out to them they refuse to do anything. This is the worse service I've ever received and I've lost a lot of money to these people. I do not recommend!! | Very goid | Usually good. Last order though, taco bell charged me $80 for a soft taco a burrito Supreme and meat nachos. Paid for meat then paid for extra meat and paid for cheese then paid for extra cheese. We did this on all 3 items. There was no cheese and absolutely no meat on anything. I checked receipt and yes I was charged a lot. We got none at all just brown beans lettuce and sour cream on all 3 items. I have nobody to get ant refund or even anybody to complain to. I will not use this app eve | Great delivery service | Quick, easy to use and reliable. | 外送員找不到路不想走路可以單方面取消訂單無須賠償，造成店家損失金錢，客戶損失時間。建議App更新不讓外送員無原因、未聯絡但可取消。 | Excellent 👌 | Great interface and awesome discounts | Ok this is my first time with Uber eat but it's great so far | I don't understand how you allow people to steal orders!! This Deshon man stole both of my orders that I got separately. At least I got a refund but it took forever and it's so complicated to do. I don't know why there isn't even a number to call to speak to an agent directly. This is not acceptable at all. Doordash allows to call and talk to an agent! | The food always shows up cold, drivers always take longer then expected. Not a good experience at all | I love uber eats | Good service 👍 👌 | Very happy with service | Overall decent if you are willing to endure the headace of the apps constant harasment to allow it to spam you and give them more money by constantly asking you to pay for premium or add to your order. | Changing my review to 5 stars. I didn't have enough money on my credit card for a order but since i was a 'valued customer' they let the order go through anyway. I feel so appreciated | great service | My order was like an hour late, and they sent me a 10 dollars discount for my ""next"" order. ""Next"", seriously!?, as if I'll continue to use your 1 hour late service. | This is the third time in a row that I ordered from Uber Eats and had the wrong items or missing items, but I wasn't refunded. There's obviously no quality check to ensure that customers get what they're ordering for. When I try to get help, you tell me you will get back to me, but you never do. I'm never ordering with Uber eats again. | Easy 5* like cmon... | I ordered my dinner from the app, but my whole delivery was missing. However the support service was so good! She helped me to refund my money very quickly and solved all my questions so I got budget to order again 😭😭😭. A very kind person, save a college student life. I hope she has a good night. | Great app | Enjoy it and love it | Good | They charged me twice and then cancelled my order. | Just a pathetic service. Increases the cost of the oder by 2x and if you choose not to pay an extra charge to have the food delivered in a timely manner, you can enjoy a cold, congealed order. My last use of this service ever. | Great | Worst app because I can literally order endless amounts of food while never leaving my couch 😂😂 | I need deliveries as I am slightly disabled.your service is much appreciated. Thank you. | More restaurants should consider improving food health and safety tamper-free packaging towards the delivery. Hygiene is important! | Awesome app!! | Much better than doordash! | The best | I'm not sure what's worse. The terrible customer service that does everything it can to still charge you when you don't get your order or the virtual assistant that can't comprehend pre programmed basic promts. Use doordash | Super disappointing service | Good deals I just hope you're paying your driver's properly which based on what I've heard I doubt. | Straight theft. Order took an hour longer than the estimated. Still hadn't been picked up and they want to charge when trying to cancel. They failed to provide the advertised service. How is that my problem? | Great but pricey | Constant errors and poor delivery of orders. Half the time my food take twice as long to arrive and usually arrives cold as they put my order with another customers order who lives in the opposite direction from me from the restaurant. Steady decline in service on this app. And why should I be paying nearly $8 in a delivery fee + service fee when I could have walked the +2km to the store and back and my delivery would still be ""on the way"". | Awful, as of late the drivers either steal your food or bring you someone else's order and it's frustrating. For a company this big to allow that is wrong. I don't blame the restaurants, but the drivers do not pay attention, or don't care. We all have kids to feed, but stealing isn't the way. | So much easy to order | Terrible service and app. wished I could give 0 stars | Not bad | Discounts baby! 👈😎👈 | Good app | Buena seleccion y buen servicio | Love it! | Location does count. If I search a store, said closest should pop up 1st. Not the one 3 cities away. Also it's becoming very inconvenient having to resign in every time, and everytime I do, you try getting me to use my credit card 1st when it's always left on another card when I exit | Mostly works great. Sometime slow deliver = cold food. | Wasted such money on this app. Fees are always rising. No matter what you need to be prepared to spend 10 dollars more than what you order, even though all items are marked up. months later, still they are horrible. they kept changing the price while I was ordering. they also changed it after it was already delivered. they only care about money not service in the slightest. | Mmmm yummers | So far, it's great! Very convenient. | They are the best I've used and I'll always recommend. They have the best refund policy I've never been disappointed with the feedback. They provide the best experience on mobile delivery hands down. | Easy to use, sometimes send deals, only app I use for grub💯 | I spend way to much on this but i still love it | Great service and workers | Good, but if you pay for Premium you shouldn't have to pay for priority delivery on top of that. It's a food delivery service. Obviously, the most premium thing you can offer is fast delivery of hot food. But you don't get it often enough. | Soild | To say that the custumer service is terrible would be an understatement. The representatives simply ignore the issue and you give standard pre-made answers and/or out righ refuse to give you the information. | I erased the app because overcharge my card monthly | I'm not happy with them nor the way they handle deliveries. To me, they are just a disappointment. | Long wait for driver assignment at time food often missing. | No deberían de dejar que los restaurantes usen sus propios repartidores si no pueden asegurar la hora de llegada | Scamners. They show the price of the food, and the price of the delivery. Then, at the end, they charge one pound more for 'service' whatever, and another pound for 'small order' 😂 what a joke. I end up never ordering. Fraude, cuidado! Solicitei a fatura com o número de contribuinte, tal não foi entregue! Reclamei e reclamei e recusam-se a entregar-me a fatura! Dizem que eu é que tenho reclamar com o restaurante... Serviço vergonhoso e falta de profissionalismo durante os contactos. | Terrible service to use. Half your order will be missing whether it be the drinks, fries or something else. Customer service is no help whatsoever and then when your order is missing they just try throwing $5 Uber cash at you and say have a good day. | Very good overall and not overly complicated | Terrible customer service! Received cold inedible food and received repeated automated messages when I requested a refund via the app. There is no access to a human who can deal with your personalised issue. Uber Eats, therefore, get to keep my hard-earned cash, but not my custom or their ineffective app on my device. It's uninstalled forthwith! | Good | Chooses restaurants farther away than ones right near me, cold soggy food because of it. Customer service tells me to do a better job choosing my restaurants. Door Dash is much better. | Very good | And still... Uber reigns supreme.. | Some time the order was not right told uber and never reimbursed | Good (: | Food isn't as fresh as expected but soggy sufficient for the distance of my favorite restaurants wish it was better. | Restaurants are forever sending incomplete orders and after a few refunds, Uber now refuses to refund you. Was missing $50 worth of food from an order and was refused a refund. It's not our fault that the restaurant or driver messed up. If they left a bag at the restaurant or the restaurant just didn't put the items in the bag, which happens almost every order, the customer is penalized? Make it make sense. Terrible. | As a truck driver traveling from state to state, it makes it so much easier to find, and located various foods and have them delivered, that otherwise I would be unable to find, and/or enjoy. | Love it | Great app simple to use with promotions | Never using this app again Uber eats have restaurants on app that don't have a contract with them 😒 | I really like Uber eats and it is amazing because it makes it so easy to order food and I get a lot of discount codes all of the time so it helps take down the price | Ordering is good service, but deliveries need to stop placing food on floor, would they like that for them? | You keep sending me promotion emails, saying I got £10 off from my first 5 orders, but they don`t even work!!! It says on a big green button: ORDER HERE I click there, it takes me to your website. I put food in the basket, but when I wanna pay, the £10 does not get deducted! WHAT A SCAM!!!!! DO NOT send me any FAKE promotion anymore!!!! | U all r great | Amazing service right on your doorstep. Quick and efficient delivery and friendly customer service. | Great! | Options are scarce, it is inevitable that ubereats will not correct order mistakes or adjust pricing from long wait times. Drivers will hold orders for hours while no reprimand or adjust is given by this app. This app puts no responsibility on the driver for missing items while stores are also not held accountable. You must immediately pay for missing items but won't recieve a proper refund in a reasonable and comparable amount of time. Will be switching delivery apps. Do not recommend | Great app! Perfect for a night you don't wanna go out. | it's really good and easy I like 😋 | Quickly sliding down hill. Customer service is nonexistent, orders constantly wrong, cold, late, or just disappointing.","{""1"":626356,""2"":74590,""3"":138978,""4"":598772,""5"":3971143}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Uber Technologies, Inc.","7908612043055486674","support@uber.com","https://www.ubereats.com",,"https://www.uber.com/privacy","7908612043055486674","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kDzXydb6ZT4LUj0RiU-GyptnVgCzzk9snN1FVxj2YfqFb4PpRdQRBKzdz4jzUOxAS9-d","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/grn52qNCb0d-4W_t5TVkbGHnetXiy3v9D3lGUvn2PLq3SOJqIHNdBKCB2lRYjiEs-YU","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7eenXbgxTdN-bdcbD6NXsthgNMlssuqe1PdHJH1tm1ffjHkL6s2ZDO8zMJMdE8Tgtg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aKqHJ06gEISD4MhJrQOwO3sdBsdM93iTvewohxRppY72CWElgjUADJ9s2VA-kuBiRww"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_OJZUIIvnvgxXSa9y2dmvkaqDrcNqaM1JJSt4MUrl4bH6a9DFTgUNI6hnssuM3QE_NQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nCsRaKtPHdFD1kzC1Vd0P43TYos6Jv4AWMH1cZH3B9rLsNoxoYdpB-KlQk2azztxjaE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/63tn9X886nrpEYBZGp7bTbxQXix6YoMRixfjPnzQaasmlHGJyuvv9pV5eqz8Iz3UjQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jL2oUlo133x-NUmQiLDa2amqOWh9aIP0WalwdnErcWmmzuVGL9NgMyHHRhtfHz7eeg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HSQhI0_XX6U8rVqiBSqNmJCdFA5xpbvw-nUgXl_JAFosluLZ5Q6MX4r21BmQWQ1dn9rX"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gbneQi5Al-pxTutz5q0LNb1ZlJVBfqattLdKxxmTqLO4Z0LTCEAufOllRSDxKUaQAw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sBMRcJLBCg1JACLnJv8nGKlTuxxT7O8OUwCRhi9qQrjMpod-91LANc004WzJoiBj7w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3nIQ8mx7NSS-0-X_qCQ-4q7eZ4J_pRn2H6ocgRZoX8YQdsKGfbjuHu4JzlcZ_DFI15kc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g3KxAZIiCuQnhEkcqXLoTovFoLIVaCosRIgsbcZsZCJDsazpcdgbiCRkCuAe20z0vA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pwfVURpxTyCYWyD_2ELmI01m7v1KrsOR8Z7-u1wp0mtHH-ib59CzpJePYc8GUIwajko"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CD9tQRqwJ8-dHWwV_12JKNXN66oq9pWsWbZj1MfmrajU8a53FyxIL__Croh7Hop51w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Dm37OIBbwPm4v77bf9szNtSTuTgk13OkSBEiSsag1mJopvzHTKJ7QfymK6nR8w_2jK_v"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8YucLLEbW2fhec4otY4IwUcgknAwq3E031C0rgjx4ztfSun6CwIU3uzRfQSX53gwIek"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yeP8YXxFeHa6q7IXFswswq9Ed4BSGFcEB3ADAHJCbMRXd0h6YZNsiWzFHob7Nvv2aj0g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lNKJ0dpYlwVETlC3ZQwe0pui2B5TWLc9CrY2-F-n6ugh-7W5cchuKaTJNNy-mjxwbqU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YycPf5nahL1XtG7DXJvPsn_xut0sr0PFcEnwMRJ9oGpyu0eBXjRsmWHogZnTxftDwKE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KkLkwbuVjGBWCTLF3pdx1ZopTOko0DVtNYlarRcJMJTIG7BCBevzs92C2iFRwnJZMUE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sZ7vIPmG5A4Tq0G2KnCLvhJUJ4T3AhnPavtKWwUWdSQHERm97IvFJZ8_BqTTmV9qnQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ofSkDOTLZv_u5ju6j6LbGzVWV7lHB6pMz0ujwwgXwykepKHjNCLXd0x6hBJ3aHE2A8C4""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,"Feb 29, 2016",1713796977000,"6.213.10000","We update the Uber Eats app as often as possible to make it faster and more reliable for you.<br><br>Love the app?

Won't come back unless it is changed. It tastes like McDonald's Mcrispy. Awful. | Easy | Will not let me order. Every time I have tried to place an order on the app or the website, I get an error stating that there is a problem submitting my order. What's the point of the app if you can't order ahead? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing the cache, disabling my VPN, logging out and back in, nothing works. | Works well 99.9%of the time, the other 0.9 is user related. | Absolutely love | Easy, Quick, simple. Love how I am able to place my orders with ease and go pickup at the restaurant quickly without the long wait time | Delicious food & Fantastic Service Every time! And yes, yet again tonight! | Great 👍 | Great | Can't use app to order ahead so that it's ready when I arrive. Panda Express and Chipotle app can do this. | Was good for a while but randomly signed me out and I can't get my account back | Not able to sign in to any account, never encountered a fast food app that's totally broken. I'll order from somewhere else | Awesome app! | It's very username friendly. | The app is absolutely hostile to any sort of VPN . | It's still frustrating having to let them know at the speaker box that I want my biscuit sandwich on a regular bun. And then 1 out of 20 times they get it wrong and I'm more upset. It was better when I could write Sub Bun in the description. | Awesome | I just truly enjoy the app it easy | Where's my chicken strips¡!!!!!!!!!¡ | I love the food and also happy 5 year anniversary form one of ur stores. | Love it!! | I love chicken | Horrible on several occasions. ""Sorry we've encountered an error"". Will not tell me the error | Great! | Love the app | Still buggy but hey what ain't 🙃 | I love them | I change phones and list my reward points, how can I retrieve my 2400 points. | I received a gift card and learned you cannot split payments using the app. There is also a 10 dollar minimum on gift card purchases. So, I had to spend more money than I intended to use my gift card. And will likely have to spend more again if I want to use what's left on my account. That's just wrong and feels like a scam. | Love it here | Kinda hard to use. Not what I would call intuitive. | Tyu Thu | Quick easy way to order ahead of time to minimize the delays of the drive through | Five star best restaurant the food is very good and the people of the workers are very nice | Order was all wrong. | I love chick-fil-a | Great! | Love it | Easy to use and redeem points earned. | Great service always | Best app ever | Very user-friendly! | chicken | This app is a masterpiece in app design. It's clean, predictable, the rewards are nice, the ability to favorite stores and customized menu items is lovely. The delay between order placement and said order appearing on a point of sale iPad seems almost impossibly fast. I don't think a single other restaurant has anything even comparable. | Always great! | The app is so convenient and user friendly! | I don't like that your order isn't started until after you arrive. The whole point of ordering beforehand is so I don't have to wait. I may as well just order at the drive-thru. | My app is hacked and my devices are cloned I need your help please! | The best food and app, hands down. Plus the perks are phenomenal! | Great getting rewarded for food we love. | Very easy to use! | The new(ish?) express drive thru option where you can scan a qr code and drive to a designated spot where they bring the food out to you is really nice. And I know it's not nice thing to say, but it really is fun to blast by the long line of cars stuck in the verbal order lane in under 10 seconds. | The app works 97% of the time. The glitch is when I try to go back and modify my order just before checking out. I like that I can create and save my special dietary choices - like a Frostie ice cream shake with diet lemonade. ALL OF THE CHICK-FIL-A TEAM MEMBERS ARE COMPETENT, FRIENDLY, AND GO THE EXTRA MILE TO ENSURE MY ORDERS ARE CORRECT The food is always fresh and satisfying, with 85% healthy food choice ... but hey, keep those chocolate chip cookies 🍪 and milkshakes flowing. Fruit cup | I love this app | Great app! | MAMIE GOLDWIRE. JOHNSON | Always delicious and correct | This app is easy to use. Canceling items can take some extra thought, but everything else is great. | Always happy | If Jesus were real, this app would have him weeping | Very smooth setup. rarely malfunctions. Sadly, it's just gotten tok expensive to eat there or anywhere. | No Samsung watch app | No matter what you all are always thinking about me and letting me know what's going on with the business and how you are there to make it better for me and the customer's thanks for your kindness Amelia | I'm not someone who usually leaves reviews on stuff, but the recent updates to this app have made me quite annoyed. It's becoming not so user-friendly. I tried to order a delivery order today, and I can't customize my items like I used to be able to. You guys removed the special instructions option along with other stuff. How am I supposed to ask for no hashbrowns on a burrito when there's no freaking option to remove them? I used to be able to just type it in, but now I can't even do that. | Can not sign in. APP is total garbage. I would have expected better. | The app keeps kicking me out of my account! | Te n!!Grant b | ♥️😍 | Ease of use, and near accurate times frames | It works. It works well. | Always fast and pleasant! | Every single time I've tried to order I get some sort of error. | best fast food restaurant | Love it | Love it great service | App doesn't work or let me log in | The app is easy to use, and the rewards are awesome! | App always crashes, have to use doordash and pay sometimes extra m SMH | Ngl, I just love the free rewards! | Love your food | I would love for Chick-fil-A to have points | Love Chick-fil-A,-A | The best ever! | Great until you get in line and an update is required and there's no option to update later. So you have a choice: sit in line until it finishes updating, or pay without the app. If I can't add this receipt to my app, then another star off of the 4. Yep. Lost a star 4/20/24 lost 2 more stars. App just signs me out for no reason. Can't sign back in. Call CFA cares. Requested a reset password to my email. Hours later no email. ANOTHER meal not on the app. If I lost my money and points .... ooooo | Makes it so much easier | It doesn't let me order anything. When I try to add something to my order, it just says ""sorry! We're having trouble serving you."" I've closed the app, changed from wifi to cell data, restarted my phone, there are no updates for the app. It just doesn't work. A more descriptive error message would be helpful. | Drive through scanning doe not work. No assistance given by employees. | This used to be an amazing app & very convenient! However, a new update that took away the customizations has made the app impossible to use. For example, if I want a bacon, egg, & chz sandwich with no bacon, the app let's me remove egg or cheese but not the bacon. I used to be able to write no bacon but now I can't so I literally cannot order in the app. I have food allergies & if the customization is gone, then have all the ingredients listed so we can remove what we need to. Horrible choice. | Awesome | THANK YOU for updating the app. My menu finally works again!! I used to love this app and used it multiple times a week. It made me update it and now, no matter what I do the menu won't load. Kind of hard to order anything when you can't see the menu. Will change review once problem is fixed. | Great | Always great service. | Best ever! | Awesome app!!! Easy to navigate and plainly laid out | doest work!!! | Amazing staff. Super fast and friendly. | The business! | Has great rewards!! | Luv this app My daughter only eats Chick-fil-A if we're eating fast food and she's able to do the app herself to order her food and game points as well I love this app 💗💗💗💗 | When the store delivers with their own vehicle, they still charge the door dash rates.

It's not it is only giving one month free trial and in only few animes and only their first season. | this app is trash | Tú anime es perfecto | One problem in this app is there are too many add compared to other apps | Love ❤️ | Buggy app can't even open an account | It's mine | great | This is not a free app. I'd rather recommend bilibili app that let you watch for free. | Switch to this app beacuse I don't like my previous anime streaming app. Buy premium immediately. One thing missing to this app is the lock screen on your player. That function is so important and you still not adding it in your player like all streaming platform have that function as its to avoid screen mistouch and interrupt our viewing experience. Overall the Anime library is decent, No connection and buffer issues, No issues with the Subtitles. Good Anime Streaming app overall. | Best | To much login issues always showing something went wrong or showing attempt limit reched 🙃🙃💔 | app is good , but I need anime recommendations and a good filter option | Too many advertisements | Not to free video | Plz add dragon ball z | the platform is sooo much better now I remember when it didn't offer much. but now its basicly a smorgous board | Demon slayer s4 please | kas free me Anime Hindi dube dhekh pate mene tum log ke liye recharge krunga😅 | It is good but... get rid of the god dam adverts like every 10 mins they are so anoying. And why can't I change the anime to dub? I could get a less rated app and one I could watch what I wanted without any premium and I could change them to dub. | Good aap | I'll Download crunchyrool just because I'm watching anime's in Hindi dubbed but there are most of anime is not dubbed in Hindi | op | awesome | Best Hindi Dubbed Anime Lata Hai ❤ Crunchyroll Nice Work | 👌 | Crunchyroll I have been searching attack on Titan but why I didn't get.pls add attack on Titan 😭 | Best app for the anime content | I love this app it is just soo Much fun | Please open crunchyroll app my app not opening do something | i love this app very much it the fact that it free and also i can wacht anime without my mom knowing cause im a kid | This app is good but why can't I use cellular data properly I cannot download without wifi but I don't have any wifi connection I have a premium subscription but I can't watch anything without wifi give me an solution for I want to watch it in my cellular data that option is not working I have enable cellular data for sync but it isn't working | very good app | It's a very nice app but still i was not able to watch attack on Titan. | everything you need In one place | this is super app but internet very fast to empty | Have the app for years and all good. Now it has improvements so it's much better. | Crunchy roll is so bad | This app is op | Great service, horrible organisation. I love Crunchyroll, but the problem with the seasons and the languages that was already mentioned tons of times is really annoying and makes hard to follow the shows. Please fix it, at least call them the same number with suffixes for the languages. | It was great for an Otaku Mega Fan like myself. I really didn't feel I lacked anything, for starters it has a very clean software and very accessible | The best anime website and easy to use | 𝙸 𝚜𝚎𝚎𝚗 𝚝𝚒𝚝𝚜. . . | Not good | Can't even use the app, as adds block you from even being able to start a video. | Don't use this app for premium subscription I subscribe trial premium. But when I'm using crunchyroll premium and I downloaded offline video in the app but why I'm unable to watch offline worst experience in trial period Don't subscribe his plan. Don't waste your money . | Racist | Many animes to watch but watching 15 ads In a row 3x an episode is crazy. | please dub Naruto shippuden in Telugu | best app | This app is the worst. Every second there is an ad that shows up and theres so many adds that i cant even enjoy watching, bilibili is much better adds doesnt show up everytime in bilibili this app sucks. Its the most ugliest app ever | love cartoons | I love it | Absolutely amazing App. Highly recommend to all anime lovers! 5 Stars! 🦾💯 | Enjoying & Entertaining | App was updated for Android 9 Sony Bravia TVs with some backported bug fixes (thank you!). I also see profiles now, which is awesome for kids! However, many features in newer app versions haven't been backported. Will they ever be? Missing: support for crunchylists, star ratings, comments, offline viewing. Crunchylists would be awesome for portability. | amazing best anime app ever | What quality is streaming? | I'll start off with this: from my experience, Crunchyroll is a great app. The GUI is good-looking and fits the app's theme well, tracking and history of what you watch, as well as adding your anime to lists where you can keep track of your progress on them. A lot more stuff that I'm not gonna precise here makes my experience with this app great. There is only one issue with this app however (but it is justified): to get the full experience of it you need to pay a subscription. | Won't let me log in | Kwaai | It's the best anime app you will find on the app store truly amazing 🤩 | Love it. | takes care of my anime necessities👍 | I just love the app | this is awesome! | MD juyel your | The subscription fee isnt bad they shut down just about all the alternatives | Always something from my pat or something new that interests me. | awesome so far only use it for about a day I like how it saves where you are in the episode and it saves the episode very convenient awesome selection too | obsessed :D | Tamil dubbed in all animes | I have tried everything to try and resubcribe, but it suddenly started declining my card that has always worked as well as the new one. | Mostly great. Sometimes it crashes in the middle of an episode but that happens to all the platforms. I've recently had problems with it automatically cancelling my premium membership. I have had Crunchyroll for years and it has never done this. Recently I even got premium again and it still says I'm using the free version. Otherwise great app for most of your anime needs. | it's great because I can watch almost any anime I want just wish there was updates to a few of them | funny anime | love the content offering here vs elsewhere. also I'm so surprised that the simul-dubs are so quick especially since I just started kaiju no. 8 | best | great app for watching any kinds of anime | considering price, services speed quality software ,software structure all are the at their bes worth the money | free trial does not work. | ❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Subtitles should be available for all audio.. | it's good, but it doesn't have everything like an anime steaming app would have, like I thought | op | App won't let me get a subscription | Very good site but there is no naruto shippuden eng dub. (In India at least) | I am very happy with this app it has all the anime that I like. | plz more isekai | Xxxdflpk gm bujhini | This app is the most ridiculous app and this app has also cost me Rs 200, I want my money back. Otherwise I will see you guys | Crunchyroll doesn't have the licensing rights for Attack on Titan in India.....Its not grate bot not bad | You should download it I love it everything is amazing but there's a problem It doesn't have 1 anime i need ( yarichin B club) but if you don't wanna add it it's fine but please fix the issue's with the add I can't skip it and so many ads pop up please fix this issue immediately but ya you should download it | Very good 😊 | Nice","{""1"":90957,""2"":29365,""3"":63345,""4"":231393,""5"":1836726}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$5.49 - $149.99 per item","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Crunchyroll, LLC","Crunchyroll,+LLC","support@crunchyroll.com","https://www.crunchyroll.com","Crunchyroll LLC, 444 Bush Street, San Francisco, CA 94108","https://www.crunchyroll.com/privacy","Crunchyroll,+LLC","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CjzbMcLbmTswzCGauGQExkFsSHvwjKEeWLbVVJx0B-J9G6OQ-UCl2eOuGBfaIozFqow","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TJmVj5-wdl5hzsTONGiNdvTM3i-wg2-sSTI-RuDRRb4rTRp8DP6QAPasfxbUVihX0O4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UZvD3frojFi0qKFh-XFFJpojcdM-Et4y-rN5X9mOf8WyhCBMvGX55keaoada4Fv5fz4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6C8Hggv67HdUTclgAd5Zj1fVKP1TTC646wzbhTJthnUNBPXWv9m_r8P7bl8Mbsc8EA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/M7kyl0yUkJuZsHiIepoGoptsjaweNGF-cez515STwCzRYJQsWMYVecaAve655tyqRUw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mM-eMQ9_1kLU04gtUzGELKbfEByXuu2lapccJYwrhqui9pS5BG8ajD18l1nZ8eWhsnt0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mkhSyJaTSHsQWXGlNdjgQeMn9VZA-IlPStn9YanEPnib3R0zGeXJt-WgXaxxzLXrDg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0MrzquJmF4QK6YbEr3ecjPwTwDq8HvRfs4ZEeEW9n2sbob1aQKXGybDuG_9ssV-2vg-q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7Vtwf60YZngUNIMRTBTn-WXSf46dJGUgkStITFYMjKCqPaaS2W1VhbxriiHb-TmMV4Cc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_X-AGBrMtqPFiUqcNUW7O7R9f6e2KTTh3zYLEJ-OEhj_6QCbSOaPb9Ijb6zmu36Dug"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3Wza6N4cwZNMmTM_wuze0HvUI96scCphb-EL19HF_dBJL-25AvUksmsV3mYqr4KbFw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nfIdYoZpO7A6xleStOxIv03h68Nq5Dl7pPy9ari-V7I7op-HhgFOQv4yk_na76zwEzE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y_0PApNosg9-x4LT9fpw4ssjy383nIUE7o5EXsV3QpJQEq-wBiKr9kgzzvqGKgsnw0_I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N5NsgGASZ-bnE-R2w48SFt8x21ejLlMvXDcp1qjQzH1q59YwKIN3ujhi0QILb2sjiTI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wqy1HyQVdwfz5OOhFoFKB-5aUG_0Cc0RkEW6PkMTSQn98pw567bzNzIrQHeL4hUViOdY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Q5nPSZQI0M_IkS9PtQGZT-DhQ6cwSOBijuTl9AiylTPdZgEwJbLMEpm1jG21yPq4Ug"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EsDnUeVcwtkWY83OoSYCF0SUxd5LeFJyBCsL2Xse_FIkhlxS_8MIdKeb1jIeVVxUz4zl"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/M-uDhePbIfYaPif43oHrAzQSTnxPLWlzexdKygvEyUyaPzj_vAAlc_Wul4zDP6UrVxk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2w4XyaRyQFZqkyoKusfKJrtVyywEeckH8KWt3G8LUQwF6fhEK9EQqRbxq5OeVtddUNg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0Rm-JwLvvdX4WtcJywTvXwfAxSP1RGupE60O0lsNPD0F3awOGF1Bw0ARVW9WyCynA4rU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DXoH8hyip2bwqdF0ttJrpdcsONGRD85ENYWEL3WT1xgrRBVQ1GAYGh7pc-tmsVNYWwyY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ui0vntvBO43Y2D2HydRRtJ5u5YZtFcZ9ZZIEVj9XeEWOSFQOVA8sttmAgjNJCpY6xA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BlE8BKkzLYBmtO4jDKr5Wlfc2IaqTKrP1idSJpT9G5C59yZG0-eUlX4xljE3RxbtxpE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cbLOhDHh8jRZzRhiyvNRGROC4G0wUuKAUSoQN-VKex5Z-KoOIok9Ogf2z3MXooW6r508"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/P4nVmaeyZOU26-Mnxjh5ggJEjJsutOrey75979BYpnX4ZGvT4Ch8d9aYsfQCRThJDQ""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ery6SSqqLLw?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TJmVj5-wdl5hzsTONGiNdvTM3i-wg2-sSTI-RuDRRb4rTRp8DP6QAPasfxbUVihX0O4",,"Teen","Diverse Content: Discretion Advised",true,"Dec 20, 2010",1713867250000,"VARY","Bug fixes and performance improvements.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.crunchyroll.crunchyroid","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crunchyroll.crunchyroid&hl=en&gl=US"

THIS CARD WAS BEEN DELAYED FOR NEARLY A DECADE . IN THE YEAR OF 2016 THE DAY I WIN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY THE DMV AND THE CITY OF COMMERCE BUSINESS CENTER WELLS FARGO BANK LLC AND THE CROSS WORD COMMUNITY IN SLAWSON AND EASTER CITY OF COMMERCE CALIFORNIA IN NATION | I love ONE especially the new features. I guess they listened to their customers about adding a secured credit card. I can't wait till it launches this year. | terrible app | Bait and Switch | I just opened my account when I started working at Walmart. The app seems to be pretty Awesome so far. | Completely accomplished funding my account and using my first purchase. Where is the $25 offered? | Love it | it sucks that you can't update your phone number and email or get a hold of your own money without the email or phone yu sign up with | Yes, I love using this one card | Thank goodness I just checked out reviews for this app on Trustpilot; they are effing *Awful* Apparently there's a lawsuit against them as well. It's coming off my phone NOW!! THANK YOU TRUSTPILOT! | Great app | Greatest prepaid card application you could use. Easy to navigate. No glitches or freezing. Security features for your card. Just an all around easy app to use . Great savings features of different types. If you need to transfer money from your savings into your debit, it's instant and easy to do so. Also allows different cash back options. It's the best banking app for prepaid cards. I 100+% recommend this application for the ONE card. It's an absolute must for this card!! | Worth it | XvBb. Z chvb vv, , you, | I love it. It rounds your change and puts it in your savings account. | Convenient because it's online by phone through browser connection | ONE is simple and convenient! Thank you for the rewards and benefits. Keep them coming!🙂 | Really great app. | Great and easy, the way it works. The people are great helping with any program!! | Thank you | Like it | Excellent | Easy to use. Self explanatory. | I've had ONE for a short period of time so far I like it especially since I'm learning how to use I can never say enough about your support team they are AWSOME they help me get started so patience understanding and kind thanks. | Great customer service | good so far | Good experience so far | Awesome | great bank app | It seems the app has potential. But in my opinion it is too cluttered with promotional stuff. Debit rewards , credit insights , credit builder , your one at work account is linked in a big blue box on top of the screen. And then amongst all the mess is your balance. Needs to be cleaned up. Not so much advertising promotional clutter I just want to see a nice clear picture of my balance. Maybe on the next update it will look better | I like it its use full | Can't figure out how to download app | 👍 | I wld do -1 denied | very useful alerts and easy to understand spending list | Wonderful program, ease of use has been a little dynamic, but your upgrading; love the early dirdep!!! | It's a pretty decent app | Amazing | OMG Excellent customer services and cashback | I haven't received the one card yet. Ms. Cecelia Brown. In the mail yet. | it is a good way to borrow some money with no interest until payday | Very easy to use. One of the better by far!!! | Walmart pay update. Broke QR scan. Support didnt have any solutions. Worst part wasn't just having to use my actual card for all purchases as obviously it'll be fixed soonish as I've gotten confirmation that I am not a isolated incident. No the worst part was just the fact they gave constant ads to go with the update for the ""new"" feature that I was happily using only for it to break... Yet here I am getting constantly taunted to use the thing that wont work. | Instant transfers to my bank would be better. Buy stocks and crypto would be better. Take payments from individuals would be better. There's a ton to improve on. Credit builder has been pending for ever. Frustrating because I want to use it. | it's a good app | ya ya it good I guess | Awestriking Amazement! | I have my one -mobile card | It's a great bank | So far, this app has been great. Easy to use and syncs with my financial institutions. | this app has a lot of issues. it also takes about a week and a half for transfers to complete. this app is too much work, and I work full time, so I don't have the time to put the work into this pain in the butt app/bank. still can't use to purchase gas at Walmart even though it says money is there. | Love the App. I like that I receive my money early | Well so far I haven't had anything done I'm waiting on my card and everything to come | I need directions to download the app I thought maybe there was resources there I can't figure it out I don't think there's no resources I don't know why I was recommended to download it not trying to bag on them I just don't know anything about it I guess I'm autistic and don't get it most of the time nobody cares about me ADA on the internet they just ignore it | Great service. Very pleased. | Thanks for squashing the bugs from the last update. | Its awesome | Customer service still needs some work when it comes to banking knowledge. The features have gotten better as well as the offerings. The new app design is more difficult to navigate and the layout is wonky. | Nothing but great feelings for this card and app so far | Awesome 💯 | Becareful with this institute, they will close your account with no information why and keep the funds !!!! They locked me out and won't return the funds. They will be hearing from my lawyer!! | New updated review: Closed my account for no reason. Did not have a chance to use as much. Original review: Doesn't let me do physical ATM deposits. I don't like having to go over to a cashier for deposits. | Excelent wallet | easy to use and a big help in so many ways. | fast and easy to access | I love this app this is the best app so far! | Loving it 🥰 | awesome 👍🏾 | so far works really simple and I love the round ups | Nice app | I'm so glad walmart has this payment. The one card. Helps me to get bills paid online, over the phone and even amusement use. For now I will be able to get started debtor. | great app | How can i deposit my enrollment direct deposit...and I need a provide | Walmart spark go to banking app | Haven't explored Wt | I LOVE THIS APP ND THE REWARDS ARE AN EXTRA | It's easier than I thought! | Well I think that they need to let people know what happens to their account before doing anything | Best experiences | OK so I love where you can set savings and set aside money for things. Events . I wish for me ... You hand couple more goal reaching spots available. Cause I set money aside for upcoming bills | It was awesome and very helpful | I love it! | Way better than my local busted ""bank"" | I've used this app since it's inception, and I love it. | Great app and service. Highly recommend! | Your ad said open an account with you and I get $1,000 to open the account you never gave me anything and now you're going to give me $5 if I invite my friends what are you a pimp or a bank | Nine yet just got a job and this is how they pay | I've been banking with ONE for almost 2 years and my overdraft protection is $50 . I think I need to change my bank | So they provide drivers with this paycard which can't be used at the gas station. 1 hint: drivers need gas. 😔 -- Why do I have to sign in every single time? So pointless. That's why you have the pin code. | It's a lie don't open a acct here they aren't giving any money plus when you question them on it they rudely tell you to close you acct then . One of my worst banking experiences | It a really good app | awesome and convenient | Nice | great card | It's been great no complaints here | I think you people are a scam | Please please add AT&T postpaid rewards like credits and discounts please please add AT&T postpaid rewards | This is a great app, before I had this app, I used to use several apps to do everything this app does all on its own, I am happy to have consolidated, this that functions well | Dont try to get gas with it. For some reason itll freeze your account and leave you stranded. Not to mention you need to go to Walmart only to put cash on it is a bit of an inconvenience if im being honest.","{""1"":2142,""2"":467,""3"":767,""4"":2640,""5"":27890}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","ONE Finance, Inc.","ONE+Finance,+Inc.","help@onefinance.com","https://www.onefinance.com",,"https://hello.one.app/e/privacy-notice","ONE+Finance,+Inc.","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LKmDwAY5I1Gpp3alHbIJw5AKQRNAaIitVBGVYFH6qWZrD_5zk7dPmO_uRTeOkwUIx28","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UfzQJpWjSVfiMUTfkjqm1drUrzNN4xki4tWpzT69dA7turMoyucRzFIKMgPmjY6OpNs","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fJoBfu5qUmf_v65rj2YQ8ybdOwJ3ivPian99COe0Z1OoO8_SrhyrvOQ0UBpduxlBvw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QwzyraFvzPJdrOttNMMP5tti1Bk-GRXVvTDARmbGdSjMwKiajR8kCAfj-_ZuS48V7KE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IUKO6snB5ble9M7QjgOMOqlJWKtZK9kESNGPXeGKlMgh0xd1W9aXTmORDbhK1EWWjA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ahkiC4VBi8mPq-V1AuqUH75_xZjhAerLoxxvdPsW0h72DIXKDbi4dGpcomDDvpObfw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YGn1xkvMi-9Jngn4htY0vOdwUX07TNKimKRRH52lNYrDzPXg4Snjgxx3YrbDVH3mG32e"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qbhPS8W4vg6Xuoxs46ez4pipGLuepySm1kSYK6YfQIZXW7LuY_ixQW6lrlp9ycpYRAs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wHVS60i4pKLo98l2lZMx9Gryscqz9sSdbZBD2AgkIVPX71G0gRr5fcGuER1j1g0yVA""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Jul 23, 2020",1713987837000,"4.9.1",,"[null]",false,false,false,"com.onefinance.one","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onefinance.one&hl=en&gl=US"

So many good games to choose from and so many ways to earn points for cash. Thumbs up 👍 | pay more play more | Thank you all | I really like this game because it's honest it does give you the money that it say that it's going to give you the money comes slow but when you're bored and all you do is play games on your phone anyway it's worth the time and the money there's nothing like making money while you play I always worry about games like this hacking into your account stealing your information but so far so good so all I can say is I trust this game until it proves me different. | App is not working properly nor is it paying properly and advertising is not showing up either | this is one of the best reward for gaming mobile apps I have been using for a while. the list is updating constantly, and offers a PayPal cash out option, unlike competing apps like M.P. that did offer a real money cash out option, but stopped doing so, JustPlay works. | I thought I won more than .10 cents. | I love it, it pays so quick | ok | great | It's real, but it just doesn't pay out as much, you think. | I am in love with just play | great game really pays | Worst app ever ,nothing to click on ,I do t see games I don't know what this is....I'm out .TIERD of trying to figure out how to use this game app. | I was highly sceptical but I played and deposited the money straight into my PayPal account within seconds got some equipment for work and a few drinks for after. Thanks heaps just play app creators | I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app. I've made over $80 in less than 2 months. It's helped a lot. Thank you for this app. I'd give it a million stars if I could. Edit I came back to say I've made $152 since I downloaded this app. I love this app. | love the game's | 🤙🏾🤙🏾 | so far so good | really draws a person in and makes them forget about the world around them | Keep raising goal so your lucky to earn 30 cents for playing 3 hours straight. I play solitaire constant notifications at top kick me out of my game every one in half minutes bc there's a place to earn 2000 loyalty coins every 2 minutes and I've been knocked out three times in a row and the timer wasn't even done.very irritating. Hate it but need money for real | great concept | Unreliable, If the app doesn't reward you the coins you are owed for completing its challenges the devs relinquish any responsibility to the partner game... which essentially means, no coins for you play something else... | easy to use. | Worked great until this past week. Contacted customer service twice, but no reply. | I love it great to stress | Good | great game | 1☆ or I cant review. So many missing loyalty points 4 game play. Submit report 100% wasted time. Rec'd points 4 level, 10, 20, 30 complete np. So I just got last complete task level 40 & its for over 6M loyalty points. Ive asked 4 help so many times 4 nothing. Proof in pics been there done that. They dont even respond to reviews. Now I'm owed (being nice) over 2M+ pts + 6M I just earned but didn't get. Tech has proven they've got ZERO respect 4 players. | it only gives you choices of games that make you watch ads after every level. and the. doesn't even give you many points for cash out after suffering through the hours of ads. they don't pay put enough and I'm sure are making bank from the 1,000s of ads that play | I love it so much it is so good 😊😊😊 | don't know yet if I will be paid for playing but we will see. | Good 👍 | I like this app but there is never any new games and the only game that gives points fast is solitaire.. starting to get bored.. have been playing for quit awhile. | New to everything games wise. So. Can't give an honest account on here yet .Will be back tomorrow. | Scam | doing this for the coins | my loyalty point went up to 1 mil within a day of playing I can't even get past 700k | Love this Games 😘😂😘 | 🚩🚩🚩Just cashed out to a WALMART gift card. Said successful payout. Never received it. Got an automated email reply to try these tips & tricks since there is no CUSTOMER SUPPORT. THOSE TIPS DO NOT WORK for payouts. Maybe someone will see this & respond. Never had a problem here. Was one of my favorites but maybe it's turned into a scammer sight to. 🚩 DON'T GO PAST $2 ITS A WASTE OF TIME & OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T GET THEM NOW USED TO BE GOOD APP. MISTPLAY .. REWARDED PLAY & CASH GIRAFFE ARE GREAT. | I honestly had my doubts about this app but when I saw that the minimum to cashout to my Paypal and it actually paid out I was so happy glad they fixed a couple problems but I really wish the points would be worth more than what they give. I love the app so much that if the app developers would like I would gladly sponsor their app verbally or I'd be willing to tattoo their app on my body for small payments for advertising their app | Don't why it says you can cash put every 3 hours that's a lie you have to reach 2$ before you can even cash out your money that you make in that period of time I don't no why they lie and say you can cash out every 3 hours your don't even get enough money to even work with Seems like it's a scam hardly no effort wasted time to find out at the end you have to cash out 2 dollars what the heck is up with that picture.. can't cash out every 3 hours thats a lie | fun games | Love it!!! It really pays you and you can cash out within hours no matter the amount you make, you can cash out. Awesome app totally worth it. It been a year and I've cashed out a few hundred. You just have to take care in which apps you pick. Take notice in how it pays out or how many tasks it offers to pay you for. Keep in mind while playing how long it takes to accomplish each task. If it's been a few days and you haven't finished the first task, quit!! | This app is a joke just another way to scam people into installing junk games on their phones | love this | I love this game but you win some amount of money | Love the games but ads during play suck. It's bad to have to re-memorize the board during gameplay. | good | I don't know yet I haven't been playing long enough but so far it's okay find out if it actually get real money or just like other scam making games | good app easy games to play | ITS VERY INTERESTED AND FUN | so far it cool n easy | This app never paid me. They supposed to pay me three days ago and now they tell me I need to wait for the staffing review and approve my regards. It's fraud. | best one yet | Well, I do love that y'all pay out, and love the games and offers, especially when I'm able to focus and really earn more than just the small amount of loyalty coins but to accomplish a few million when Im at my lowest because of scammy scammers ROCKS! SO THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING HERE, DOING WHAT YOUR APP SAYS, AND HAVING FUN APPS TO MINDLESSKY MEET VERY MUCH NEEDED GOALS! bday gifts aren't cheap haha--- -BDAY GIFT SAVED BY JUST PLAY | i love it | too many ads | I give 4 stars cause it does pay quickly. But to many ads,and you can't get but 40 cents at a time for playing a long time. But it does pay. Still you have to get to 2.00 to cash out when it is supposed to be any time any amount. | 😉👌 | I love it so fat the games are fun | overall amazing app and totally legit but my loyalty coin goals are far too high relatives get goals such as 200 thousand whereas mine are always in the millions which is an utter joke, but if u are lucky enough you can earn lots quickly. | it really does let you cash out awesome. | Yes this game pays you money but not a lot I have to play several games to make it to my goal and there are ads in this I thought it said that there wouldn't be no ads but what game is not with ads can't find any of them this game is a joke it took me so many times to play to make it to my goal I've only got to cash out $21 but only made a few cents each time I played a game | love it | I don't know about this.. | great easy to win | I was very skeptical of using this app but as I am using it now I've already hit my loyalty coin goal and actually surpassed it, will update review with how much I got off of x amount of coins | Seriously!! Could the balance updates wait until after the game is completed? Instead of after every play in game?? I want to keep playing but this is almost a deal breaker for me. | this addiction is optional | none yet | Love it!!! | Amazing game that really pays out but way to many ads plus it has took me a 2wks jt to $10.00 by making a few pennies at a time you don't get $10.00 in a few mins I just don't understand why you are doing this you have wrong rules why can't you do the right thing you do respond to my email but still making pennies have a Blessed afternoon your in my prayers shows a notice saying pays out $108,888.00 all I get is pennies nothing has changed 🙌💙🧡😇🦅🌞🙌 | This app allows you to pay out one to two times. Then it never seems to let you pay out after that. If you reset the app it'll let you pay out again. I personally feel it's not worth your time. I also try to contact that creator about it. But when you go for support the only thing they give you is an article to read on how to fix issues. There's no person that you can speak to directly about it. Once again don't waste your time. | While I consider this to be one of the better money making apps, this one is lacking in consistency. There's no indicator of just how much money you'll make. I'd honestly just appreciate if there were something like ""watch this many ads and get this much money"" but the whole coin system kinda sucks, it's like it doesn't even matter if you get a lot or barely any. Sometimes I'd go way over the coin goal only to get a dime at best. There's just no clear way of getting at least one dollar per reset | Thank you and THANKS 😊 | fantastic actually | It's a scam doesn't pay out | In the beginning they give u decent rewards for playing but the more u earn or play it starts giving u significantly less coins per time and takes forever to even get 1$ | Very nice so far. | awesome permission all granted | To many ads | I did a 5 star rating bc this app actually pays out directly to your PayPal. The only bad thing is there's only 1 fast card game to get points and you have to play like crazy for 2hrs just to get $2-$3... I wish they would up the pay. | I also have to notify the users that to earn money u have to watch tons of ads | How do u unsubscibe | quiet enjoyable game for now | not worth it tons of ads making them rich and now they down to only payouts 2 to 7 cents an hour deleting app much better ones out there was good when it lasted but then as always they got to pushing way to many ads and costing back on the payouts | fun | Yes it pays out but to accumulate the money together takes a long time 1 cent to 5 cents | Best 1 yet! | Had been playing the app off and on all day. Had to stop to cook when I returned to play the app the money that I had accumulated was only 56 cents. I do not understand what happened so I checked to see if I had cashed out, but I hadn't. This is the first time I have experienced this. I am ready to uninstall this app. I was so disappointed.

Why not taka break from social media and scan those receipts quickly! It only takes a few minutes and BAM! The points add up quickly! Most ppl go to digital coupons when they shop.. add ur receipt to Fetch and ur still saving on something that u were gonna pitch! | Great | Still loving this app. | Love keeping points to earn gift cards. It's my way of giving to others. | This app is great and easy to use. Love the way you just scan any receipt and play games to quickly cash out with a gift card. Also the promos are good to give extra points if you purchase. Thanks fetch I love this app!!!! | Just love saving those points for my grocery needs. | Buena aplicacion, lo unico que me gustaria que el usuario pueda restringir la vista de su actividad de canje de puntos o de facturas subidas, tambien mejorar el tiempo de entrega de las tarjetas compradas, por eso le doy 3 estrellas. | easy accumulating points easy to use. love this app | I have been using this longer than I care to admit. I keep thinking it will improve. It certainly has potential to ..like well over a year ago they added a friend thing, Stupid me adds umpteen people Which is utterly useless unless you are the top three ofmillions of users. Otherwise it is a useless scroll Unless you shop a handful of brands it is slow going. It is not a scam but collecting any thing unless all you eat is Pepsi and Cereal and have a baby it is slow going. | Fetch ROCKS!!! | Awesome | I enjoy using this app. Sometimes I forget to upload my receipts though. | I hate this app | You Really get REWARDS FOR PLAYING GAMES AND SUBMITTING RECEIPTS Y AND REAL $ LOVE IT | One of the best apps ever. Get free things from ALOT of places. | Not really worth my time, rewards take forever to accumulate. Maybe 5 to 10 cents per receipt scan? | Like the different stores and different things to buy f or points.you get extra pòints | Easy. Understandable. Gives me a break with the free gift cards. Just scan receipts. | initial it was great. now I can't scan but a few at a time. then, it expires after 7 days. just pure stupid. not scanning after April. | Was a great app but ive noticed that I don't get near as many points as before. It's almost like they watched what people were buying then changed the points to stuff not a lot of people buy. I can spend $200-300 and only get 25 points for scanning the receipt. | Takes to long to earn enough points to buy anything to make it worth saving receipts and uploading pics etc..... waste of time | it's the best receipt and games that's awesome | Rarely ""grabs"" receipts when scanning. Very frustrating. Contact us section was less than helpful. Get bounced from person to person in the chat. Just wanted to get BK receipt verified for the Offer. They can't do it bc it isn't grabbing my e-receipts. I may just be don't with this app. | great app. | I used to love this app, and now it won't even open. The dog shows up for a second, then gone. I reached out to tech support but got some generic answers about every issue except mine. I've installed and reinstalled it several times, but it is still not working. I'm sad. | takes a long time to score a gift card | Love this app. | Love it A++++!! | Easy peasy | Seems a legitimate app. I've been scanning away.... simple to use. I have been using the app now for quite a while and am about to be ready to cash in. This was a cool experience and guided my shopping in order to acquire points. Good job. 👍 UPDATE: This app is great. I actually have $45 in Amazon gift cards still from 2023! This app is one of the best "" pay for info"" apps available. thank Fetch...4/24 | Deceptive. I never had any problems scanning my receipts when I would order online. They do not have an option for this retailer to do e-receipts. So I print and scan. Now they won't accept printed receipts. And you get the BS from customer service aka Amy. I definitely will be looking at other apps for my receipts. Very frustrating. | Fetch won't let me delete my account | It's fun at first; and the points start to rack up pretty quickly. The trouble is, once you get near the end of the time or tasks required, they stop counting your points. Then when you tell them about it, they'll give you LESS THAN HALF the amount of points you missed out on. If not for this issue, I would give it a better rating. It seems businesses just Forgot How To Do Good Business. It's just terrible. | I'm new | I love this app! What more should I say lol | Good application. | used to be great, but now it's a little stingy without the daily spin and lack of 7k points per share. | Need to add yahoo, outlook or hotmail mails. Not all is Google... | This was a great app. I did not mind playing games, now I can't even play games it does not allow me to click to play games that I have on my phone or get new games. I have contacted customer service but they tell me they can't help me only to restart the app which I have. | I have gotten so many gift cards. It's easy to rack up points. I've played the games and it helps alot. | Great app I just hope it actually gives me the gift cards!! | Used to like it ... Good luck getting in decent points anymore unless you are all bout alcohol or junk food... | Great rewards for the things you need. Great places to use your rewards....Love It. | It was great at first, but has gone downhill every since they took away its daily rewards. It was replaced with games, but it doesn't give you points every time you play that game. | fun and easy!!! | I like the concept of this app but most of the time it dosen't work. I never get the correct points for items that are advertised and it wont link to my accounts half the time. | It is good to use and you get free gift cards but you have to work hard but it's all good | Always messing up | fun and easy | quick points. easy rewards delivery. | 04/2024: After earning gift cards, give it 5. It's free 💕 12/2023: I would have given it 5 stars cuz it is pretty cool. I don't understand the point of adding ""friends"". Also, they added a little points earner called ""Let's play"". It would be pretty cool if the games didn't need to be downloaded. The choices are games heavily laden w/ ads, but I do appreciate the points for rewards. A person has to buy the national brands constantly, not store brand, & buy often to get max value on receipts. | 00pm no if huh GJ ĥ6 | Great app | so far I've won nothing.. so we'll see.. | This is awesome!!🌸 | Definitely worth the space on phone and time! | Use to be a great app but lately will not pick up my amazon receipts. I've had three in the past couple of weeks and when scanned comes up zero. | Stop letting points expire!!! | That should get more points | Love the ease of getting points with receipts and games! | very easy to use. | Thank U | I love free stuff!!! | No one stood behind their policy that's a loyal customer never received a $25 off and order the store tried three times and can I get it off but that's just telling them that it did come off clearly states on the receipt nothing came off so I'm out of 25.00 and no one has reimbursed me for it watch what you do with this company | If I could give negative stars, I would. Fetch regularly delete points from my account claiming they are for a business. I don't own a business the points are my own personal shopping but as soon as I get very many they delete them claiming it's for a business | Not really sure how this app works | This app used to be pretty good, but now it's hard to get points for much of anything. Things that you used to earn points for are now no longer accepted. Like others, I'm also having issues with e-receipts even though my accounts are still linked. It's not picking up on them. When I contact support, they say to check for an update (There's not one, but it seems as though the last update they had was when these issues with e-receipts began.) So aggravating!! | I love this app and the games are great too easy to play. Only bad thing it's a lot of ads | Fun way to earn gift cards on something you do daily anyway. Very simple to do, customer service is great and quick to respond. Loving this app. | Love it 5 stars love this app... Just got my first gift card I used it at Amazon.. thank you | Love, love, love this app!!!!!! All you have to do is scan your receipts and earn points. Once you earn enough you can cash them in for a gift card. I've had this app for years, and I will never delete it!! | I would like this app better if I could play the games that will earn me more points. The app says that I am blocked. Not sure what I can do about it. | Love it !!!!! | ok | All of a sudden my Amazon account was unlinked. I re linked it and it still won't pull my ereceipts. Why? I emailed support and got nowhere very frustrating have tried 3 or 4 days in a row. Receiving my packages but NO POINTS HERE | Fun way to make some extra money. | Fetch is exceptional! Easy to upload receipts and redeem points! Thank you FETCH! | Great app, you just scan your receipts and get points that can earn many different gift cards | This app used to work fine but recently, it won't open. The logo just flashes on the screen and then shuts down. Fix it please. | This APP is a REAL treat for the shopper which WE all do. Idea of giving you something back for your time spent in different places is so great that you look forward to your shopping experience now. I am not a real fan of that activity but with FETCH it is becoming an enjoyable task. Really, thank you maker's of this APP it's fun. | App malfunctions. They also started to spontaneously deduct points for no reason so there is no reason to have the app | LOVE THIS APP!! GOT MY FIRST REWARD - AMAZON CARD!! SO EASY!! | Just doing real good 😊 | I refered two people got 4000 points for first second none makes no sense. But other then that easy to use they didn't get their points either. | Awesome!.. A lot of my family members and I use this app and We Love It..!!❤️💯 | App was great but now has a bug and wont open, please update | Friend told me about this thought I'd check it out | No more daily spins. Not worth my time to download a game to earn extra points. Downloading games wast my time and adds additional storage to my phone. | Love it | Just redownload after ha in it for a week or so. 🤞 | Bonus points for burger king breakfast, wasn't given | Enjoy benefits for games,receipts and. stores | Easy to use, easy way to earn a little money | I've been doing Fetch for a couple of months now. It's fun to actually buy what to already purchasing with points. | It's fun and it makes money | Didn't even give me a choice were I wanted my reward to go and so it's been stuck on Amazon I ""think"" for month's now. Deleted app and never tried again. It was a waste of my time even trying. Wish these apps were more for the person putting there time in playing to earn. I really needed what I was working for. | Loving this App | Thay kinda fixed it it's a little better | Easy | When I was playing when the slot machine games it kept coming up with the box that said not responding either way or quit I can't happen to tap on weight to play the game and that's ridiculous and then the game freezes up!","{""1"":36065,""2"":19156,""3"":48312,""4"":119825,""5"":867872}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Fetch Rewards","Fetch+Rewards","support@fetchrewards.com","https://www.fetch.com",,"http://www.fetchrewards.com/privacy.jsp","Fetch+Rewards","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9CakeZbevQQcaiHfIdl_deMmKioQTpN3tnuku31p-Amkx6L4XGj9kaub3bjypHiuH-A","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KTYk1S4BoUd2_bowM5AsHyhZW6rRqlhPczlJDPYAfw4hxToSxO6YTP1spPqncCkmawI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hen4rlYTmgUG2y3q__DsgVdmte8Um7BTek0szU0otQCV4bcza4fZPW53H0Z-V3TXRXOR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N7ZK2MmrzuOf6i5JCQ6-GNl3kL9q_3W0-yXn7Phz3shUh6k8L8TPmf-UFRPDr9F9JIDj"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Rn0Z5hNZhWgoiZi3MO-NxUHyBNGi1YTCq361Np-egLo0-YRMAfnzGHk25Vwa9rLQNbPb"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DcLRpOAbCTfrFhqwjtXVMerK-QOTaErAjgMirllOUxv_fxjFqrHBZbP9BvY-iOGaiBM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1TN5y7qq1ZwmDKWsEsUp8K3kS-S93c15FSAYr98eMK2IkhOgRwJ7Y0fPSWeyrBqMsjw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eo2upXlCWjaM-PEE5De6iw7ta2MZesOyabwmFn_eaVXNWElRA_xi2PmyUqwlLmOe0HI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4cJAj_ln8G64jfRnqNuPz7svJ9R5-M7N2ELFLJMsrvxwmfIgqzla19EWL3YiKBX1-pM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q-ZeBM-FgWQLXXKdTNz1jntQovEmuJf6se9XPWcPwEWES_om6yIssgeDoopCFeGdsWg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E1v6uHF2VnCfuK4cwuARAdoGC7j3kb0U8f6FHyvs-Oc_EQlqeclhSw559FBRx83ZRA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ByDsFr5kln0lAthGnWkf7rGrto1Z6GJsRF7xTNP8Qpi8LLH50bbue1yCHYgSV7lJaQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Mo4bcUu7ZhjRQkVlsGv8aJQ2EIvB9uqOFWMa8x9TsPy1j4f9wcUiaiZtHiuPgdeoJ5pq"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5B6bzRPIns_R-VZyzmkRybvASevx8WSlV0w1mfN-rfFqzqB1y57amId2sM6jKn9AMQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZMifzzmWPzg3o4T2lK-fxUdzVY9G7VPahxAI3bhlkh6GwihOPGYFgQ10nRxMkxy7c8Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TT7d0uHvoytciEOOUuPPWxi_zFwy9Hx-Ue-ycKMK94Xj65eZQWBV9HdUGV_tpF-eBm0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HZrb2pgyQULCFHmUEdeeaoglqcItcLSzqbHxt0Hc25y5c0YL19Yy1GPHeotIw49XfO1A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aVhTrqmOlzxS8ufCOuPeSyURAtJgv_0ayCbaY4cpi9rTcdh1iI8lZRsgqzWoVr33enw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LmGrGodWETS9PN4Cm4uGdi7o4kBYUUOxA6mVSgeMKd73kkwuIj_UiVPSsSBXfuYc9R8Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7J2Rk3n2Klp5vOzd_2I2aTpa5A9yegfzoSJGosaAWyUX5TkWR3Pj9Mgum6PGHZ8BzMU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5CDo_HiEMktllrzv2yWvjYgQ6L9WrQZE-ogCPLePobvPsDt1A_Bqqmx8CWjFSCuH7jT4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rL8-eo7Gw7z2oSJtakNWbcma8w90C4Sc6uWG6HgGHTX6B6zLoBd_ewQclACAPaRqqD8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ovd7o2bMS7tivovtCh-73rpdWT-POI7TJSTCTeafQSzswUXLBPNfwQIEclVmdkEGgZE""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZ7JzQERGeo?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KTYk1S4BoUd2_bowM5AsHyhZW6rRqlhPczlJDPYAfw4hxToSxO6YTP1spPqncCkmawI",,"Everyone",,false,"Dec 7, 2016",1714166403000,"3.44.0","No notable updates to mention this week.

I am waiting....... | Very easy to search what you need. we love the clearance section. | Ordering online and store pickup!! What a time saver | Very slow and bugy app. | Found exactly what I was looking for (rubber stair treads) and cheaper than all competitors! | Great app and great prices at Home Depot. | easy and good | a special thanks to Belinda store 0275, she has taken time to help us order our vanity. professional and helpful! | This app is great in that it lets me order, etc. But it's excruciatingly slow and frustrating to use. | Why would the app automatically put in a random color tint when I picked a bright white base? You come to deliver the wrong order. You then do not redeliver the correct order. Sales rep suggested I cancel order so now I am charged for delivery fees for the wrong order to be shipped? I have had nothing but problems with home Depot, in Store and app. I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for multiple businesses. It is time to take my business elsewhere. | I logged into my store & within 15 min (that includes some browsing of the website), my purchase was complete. I'll pick it up curbside & finish the job this weekend. How convenient is that! | been purchasing from Home Depot for 30 years. 5 stars | App is slow and works best for online orders that are not in stock. | app is buggy | Home depot damaged my truck and then told me to beat it we are not fixing it. The manger said she was on my side then did nothing. All are liars. | Easy to use app. I'm also able to use my military discount with the app. | App is very flaky since updating. Will not hold my place and randomly jumps back to home screen, completely eliminating what I was searching for. Normally this app functions very well and is full great features, making it one of the best retail apps out there. Fix the bugs! | Solid App. | Home Depot Rocks! | the app is really bad slow outdated | Great Customer Service | the slowest app in history. | Veygokd bb nv. | online ordering system is terrible, online assistance is even worse | my favorite store!!!! | Excellent | EXCELLENT SERVICE | app is glitchy at times. | Only place we go. Can ask ? On anything and they HELP fast. With good alternative! | How do I give it Zero Stars it is absolutely worthless. It's worse than being on dial up back in the day.I aged 30yrs trying to search a faucet and your in-store option it garbage. | no longer supported on tablets, asenine | Hope this works | crashes but still easy to use | Good when it works, frustrating when it cancels your orders later on though and it's really not cool when they suddenly change your credit card limit without notifying you first | Extremely slow! Buggy app. Shipping with fedex is horrible. Absolute worst customer service. Automated system doesnt work!! Worse is online return are not process correctly causing even more return issues and delay. Absolutely worst online shopping experiance. | online ordering was very easy and fast. try and update when product is delivered tomorrow. | easy ordering on line. | love the depot ❤️ | love home depot | ordering from Home Depot on line is a lot easier now | Love Home Depot | laggy and glitch, but works | app is easy to use | excellent quality great prices... | 👍🏽 | Poor. I couldn't get what I needed because two aisles were closed. | great selection, very competitive prices, and delivery. | Helpful when you can get it to work, but it's the most bloated and least optimized shopping app I've used in a long time. LTE, 5G wifi, doesn't matter what you're on, it takes ages to load anything, which is very frustrating when you're trying to use it to find something in the store. | Impossibly slow, can't share items, can't identify items scanned in store, overall a really disappointing experience. | Open the app just to be told it's not compatible with tablets, maybe remove it as an option for tablets then? | Good deals online and in store for your needs. | No longer on tablets... how stupid can a business be... it's called a universal app, Mr. Decker | Love Home Depot especially their app. I have purchased many items and am always happy with the products and service. | easy process | love home depot, love rigid. | easy to use. don't have to ask anyone where anything is anymore. | Excellent performance of HD app today. | Cant share anything, share button does not work. I emailed developer and no response. | Paypal purchases not working. | Quick, easy order, good price, military discount | Never use | The share button on app doesn't work on my Samsung note 20 and my coworkers phones (androids) please fix with update | easy and painless. | I find what I need to renovate the home. I am working every time I go to Home Depot or their website. | I love the ease of service and military discount | Home Depot online is great! | easy peasy | easy to use app | I love the convenience of shopping online! I especially appreciate the military discount. I love walking right into the store and having my purchases already available and ready. No looking around in the store. | Some improvements over the last few months, but I really wish they would spend some more time on polishing this. When I search online I use the mobile app the majority of the time | love this place | keeps getting better","{""1"":16696,""2"":6433,""3"":17408,""4"":65228,""5"":441079}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","The Home Depot, Inc.","The+Home+Depot,+Inc.","onlinecustomercare@homedepot.com","https://www.homedepot.com",,"https://www.homedepot.com/c/Privacy_Security","The+Home+Depot,+Inc.","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n-vPcnP-kTyZ5eH6QJkIvAhylJuU__wOZyfcJR3D3u2N1aChqfXEroE4KVSfNlGd2Hs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/p6kb_cPcKj82db4DwRzkxk9qnekoQKed438UtDzbFL5gQjm4ne-pTOzoIOdgxFzilA","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ztuCl9VuNR0lZH7Fc4FNrazBXfJJtAPX2ROSdlnq6dsmvvoHflXjOsAgQKxWpW6Y63nC"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kDYIX2ouzSw4pZWkg3OA_N8Dgg1eTCLfShUZlOPDesEPT80F1zrTN1bvl-_ryOOCjDsw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E3m4u46T2-y4A84DOELa69pctseQKJtAM38mRyQsGwY7Ja9F-8AYk4BD8gYlSCyJPQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qE4h4R9v2d7tnHjrcfjIsD4l3OsIRuxA8KqrD7Nt_p7xSkVHfDVJhm0LCcPeGYjm37GS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/P3WlAPCe_K0jJBKL-pOjpeE21-8HNBTT_Z6FfD0ZSf40iCTdMYoAFxnP7DBWv2Zg3A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/laZypv9w6y7cEKBeAyiOh764wNVQUPyUXWmYK4WTu0Ej5CcGq7_UTOTFtWRDy0e7mE0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6CgcY_p8u-yjNXrMGWgDmRT6XzqnZ92pXgS9iqf_b_cVndE7joiYJj_zBuDPLjESKw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aoH7yLt4sYooJ1OQy_eTtKpbmQwBdFpcOsaGfEZxICWdj4sjOmD0y-_JwL-KQjePpeU""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2c_avCkyy0?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/p6kb_cPcKj82db4DwRzkxk9qnekoQKed438UtDzbFL5gQjm4ne-pTOzoIOdgxFzilA",,"Everyone",,false,"Mar 15, 2011",1713301889000,"7.29","Just a few fixes and performance updates to keep things running smoothly.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.thehomedepot","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thehomedepot&hl=en&gl=US"

Have to wait for sometime to load. | My customers were very kind people. I enjoyed interacting with all of them. | What's the problem. Why account deactivated? No phone is call police | have issues with the in app map | ok | Great iv did it beefy | App is often glitching, and I'm a slave to the algorithm (and the glitches). Pay has not increased alongside inflation and no expenses are covered. | No promotions anymore, the big one at the beginning never happens again. The new ""lack of"" rewards system is a joke. Being technically functional is the best thing that can be said about it. It is only worthwhile to dash by time, and it is only offered about a third of the time at best. As a dasher, i would not recommend dashing unless you drive a very economic vehicle and dont have to care what you make. Actually, i just wouldn't recommend it. | This app is worth app and I'm using this single last year and I compare with ubereats, this app not give best delivery price | It seems with every update the app gets worse and Doordash finds another way to reduce how much they pay delivery drivers. | Since update App freezes to a white screen anytime I select time to dash... | Just a heads up, if you have to wait more than 10 minutes you can drop the order without penalty but you do not get paid for any sort of delay pay if you wait for the order. I waited just over 1 hour for a Walmart order and despite having confirmed arrival when I first got there, I got no extra pay. | App keeps deleting schedule dash. | I really like being a DoorDasher | pay more per delivery | I don't understand why i can't complete my sign up. I can only get as far as my legal name, then hit continue, and it just loads the same page, wanting my name again no matter how many times I've tried. Support is a joke. I literally sent emails explaining what it's doing during the sign up process, and the response I got was that we could find no account in our system and say I must complete the sign up application. So what is going on here? They respond without reading email. | too slow | love it | does not work when busy | fix your app. | I can't complete registering. It keeps circling back to me entering my name. I've Uninstaller and reinstalled multiple times and still the same error. | I love my job with doordash | The app is keep crashing every time I decline an order it doesn't register and when I go back to the homepage and just go back to the app it just gives me the doordash logo. Regardless how good my internet is and it does not notify me half the time that I'm in a time out and there's a time limit on doordash needs to fix this. This has been going on for a month now This is terrible | this appears much better having a guaranteed minimum pay an hour. there were times where I didn't make nothing in an hour or I only made a buck or two. so this is pretty incredible guaranteed of at least $16 an hour during the time I just dashed that's way better than it used to be and it makes it worthwhile thank you to our dash for doing something different | Fix the wrong address glitch Sometimes when you click navigation through the dasher app. It marks the address that is right next to the other address. Sometimes it can be off by 1-2 houses. Dasher in app will say one address, but the one on Google maps will show the house number next door. Which causes deliveries being marked at the wrong address | I just love dashing it gives you a chance to see beautiful kenti | awful , tech support never helpful | Can't get past the sign up portion asking for name just keeps cycling, and there are zero help or support options to get through the issue. | I have been a dasher for well over 5 years. As of today, I was terminated due to a background check done in which found me speeding over 3 years ago. I was found to be driving 5 miles over the speed limit. Both Uber and GrubHub was much more understanding of the situation when it happened. If DoorDash is to be as strict as they claim, they wouldn't have waited 3 years to discover this incident. Both GrubHub and Uber addressed the issue within a year. | As a dasher I am tired of not getting orders when I'm out. I've been told repeatedly by dash support that the errors are always on my end. I have to constantly troubleshoot to get orders. The dash support always blames the system itself stating they can't do anything about orders because they are computer generated. – support doesn't do anything. I don't even know why they have a job if they're not going to fix the problem. | This app needs to be fix. It keeps crashing randomly and doesn't open correctly sometimes. Even during orders it stops me from completing my orders on time. | this app constantly has problems. especially after they give you an update. I dread when I have updates to put in the phone | Love it so much great app good mapping | App doesn't work at all for me. I keep getting sent back to the start😠 | Keeps deleting my scheduled dashes. | I can't schedule work in my zone. I ask for help, and they say its not open. There's no way all slots are taken. Can't schedule ahead anymore, unless it's in bigger cities. They're about hour or more away from home. What happened? Did something change? Wish I got more orders. I was doing good. Something ain't right. | I can't find how to change bank information and I can't find how to get the gas card | The pay is definitely not there.... It's crazy on what Dasher pays out. 1 out of 15 trips might be worth it. Distance x Time x Gas = $$$$. They like yo pay $ or $$ most of the time. 8$ a hour - 10 if lucky. I see 5$ for 20 miles. That's crazy! | It was easy to use. I'm happy with it. | Wish they would turn down the obnoxious hold music or turn up the support volume. I see we're back to taking pictures of the receipt. Why do they send the order after I've driven past the restaurant, like you knew where I was and there was an order, why wait till I've driven 3 blocks past, illogical. | not bad could pay more | I wish y'all fix the log in issue I can't even make no money smh | Im stock in filling my info for my dasher requirements. It's been like this since morning. | great network although it was was hard to get in contact with customer service but still fun app | Won't even allow me to make an account. I entered the information for my name, signed in, and then I'm redirected right back to asking for my name. | Sucks I can sign in on my older phones but I can't sign in on my Samsung galaxy a13 5g what in world going on with app fix it to where we can sign in on a Samsung galaxy a13 fix app it always glitching and getting low rating because of it and nothing getting done about it | Immediately hit a spot that wouldn't let me sign up. It just asked for my name over and over. Help wouldn't work on the ""browser"" I was using. I was using this app. | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Could not get past the sign up screen, after inputting my name and submitting the form it would take me right back to the beginning of the form, this happened on multiple devices, the sign up process can't be completed in a web browser like chrome or on a laptop | Great but it has an issue when navigating to hot zones by opening google maps which causes two different navigation apps open leading you separate ways. | It is nice doing my own thing, however I don't like that we, as dashers, can't leave reviews for the restaurant and that we can't choose whatever zone we want to schedule ourselves in. There are closer places to me than what they offer and unless I drive towards that zone I won't know of its busy or not which is an error to me when there are so many dashers available in the same zone. One would think they would let you dash wherever you want to schedule which would be a nice upgrade to this app. | love it | great lil side hustle for times of need! | For myself, the app works very well while in Samsung Dex mode. The only issue I ever have is that the app needs to have cache cleared once part day or or will have issues loading. | I wish I could give negative stars.... After being a top dasher for 6 months in a row after my phone broke and went and used a old phone til I got my new one and then when I got my new phone dasher flaged it as fraud and kicked me from the platform........ | Won't go past 1 screen | App has been working fine. However now with the new update and rating system and deliveries in the last 30 days. Its hard to reach 100 deliveries when daily they go back down as days go by. I Was just at 92 deliveries and now I'm at 83 today which sets me back to reaching 100 to be able to dash anytime. Please fix this. It should be monthly how it was before not last 30 days, you're basically forcing us to work if we want to stay as a top dasher and be able to dash anytime. Ridiculous | Good 👍 | I just started today so to give an honest opinion I couldn't right now. Look forward to given a positive response soon. Thanks for the opportunity to work for door dash | I can't rate this app cause every time they have a issue they can't fix | I've seen the CEO of Doordash at a poker tournament gambling over a million dollars away. Doordash doesn't care about their drivers. They let customers not even tip a dollar and expect us to take the delivery and drive 13 miles for $2 and punishes us for declining it. My account got hacked and over $1,000 was stolen from my account and doordash still hasn't done anything to get my money back. I've made this job my full time job and it sucks how poorly I'm treated. | I am not happy with this app. I went to sign in, and the app was deleted from my phone. Now, after resetting my password, it will not log me in with the new password I have followed all the required steps sent by support, and nothing is working All I keep getting is the same run around with support, and I am not making any money whatsoever because of this stupid app and the same instructions from 5 different people who sent me the same information 5 times now | Been driving for this company for a couple years now and now the scheduling is NOT working again! Update 2024 scheduling still not working. Support never helps. This issue started in 2021! | great app | Can't get past the initial first, middle, and last name section | Getting worse not better | It's a hassle to sign in | Refuses to do anything with my background check | Product team, how about giving me the option to customize the types of deliveries to get assigned? I don't want to take a $12 delivery that is 10 miles away at rush hour that will take me 1 hour to make the round trip when I could make 3 or 4 deliveries within 3-5 miles that will yield me $20. How about a feature like 'max distance in final 30 min of Dash' so I stop getting 10 mule away deliveries that I will not take since it will go to the end of my scheduled time and I won't get a return $$. | Trying to sign up to become a Dasher and it won't even let me get pass putting my name in and just keeps refreshing the app making me enter my name in over and over again and won't allow me to get any further in my application. Terrible app, off to Uber Eats I go. | I have been top Dasher all but 1 two week period of my employment. Those two weeks I lost it were due to app issues. I have never seen Springfield listed as an option to schedule for since mid February and I am about to switch my employment to a competitior simply because Door Dash's ""VIP Support"" lack integrity as well as are lazy and don't want to assist they just want to repeat words on a screen so they can hang up. | This app on trash and so are the 20 yo programmers who helped make it. Glitch glitch forced labor less than min wage | it's a good service.deliver food to people that are hungry and get paid | this app absolutely socks they need to do a tun of New Updates or shut the app down and redo the whole entire app Problem 1- app is soooo slow Problem 2-it always needs to be refreshed or force closed Problem 3- This app is always glinting Problem 4- None and I mean none of the refreshing techniques they tell us to do work at all . Problem 5-It is so overloaded w dashers now that it is not giving orders out like it should or us to I am running out of room there r many more! Fix It! | I've been driving for 3 years over 6k deliveries rating never below 4.8 but the automated facial recognition messed up and I was deactivated, appeal denied with no contact no information. I can only hope the predatory practices this company has made their policy consumes them. Never wanted the capitalist engine to crush a business so bad. | Pay obviously could be better, but it's nice to have flexibility as well. | great side cash | It's a really really great platform. I just wish they would reward me more for going the extra mile for everyone. It's millions of civilians here in California. Orders should be coming in rapidly. Especially when your consistent and online all day. I can go to McDonald's and see about 5 more orders where no driver have been assigned. Not complaining just giving point of view. I speak for hundred's of drivers with kids and families to provide for.. even for the single. Love you Door Dash 👑 | Cannot even sign up to dash. It keeps rerouting me to the beginning asking me to put in my personal info all over again. | I got it | The app keeps glitching and logging mw out mid doing a order | while dashing, upon pick-up, having problems w connection AND upon delivery the dasher app wouldn't let me take a photo which put me over the time to be delivered.(could be due to the weather) | This app is useless to those who live in NYC it seems like. You cannot schedule a anywhere within the five boroughs unless it's Forrest hills stadium | quite convenient | Infinite loop can complete process to be a Dasher | Issues with the app when trying to load 2 separate orders at the same pickup location. The map lady also takes you in unexpected directions, Google map vans need to update all the new amazing growth in Omaha! Come on! let's get it good n done now! | great way to make a little extra money | The GPS is very terrible sometimes | we are out here delivering your dinners & it's sad that you can't even give us a tip | So much bugs and the app is very unstable, hard to work sometimes when your trying to drop off an order and it doesnt let u complete the order becasue something keeps going wrong in the app! Fix it! Edit: as of 2024 the app is actually pretty good now not so many bugs now but I would love for the hour rate to open up for me more lol | Couldn't get the app to even let me sign up properly. Had me sign in using my existing account for door dash ordering and it keeps cycling me back to input my name over and over. | More bugs than an Assassin's Creed game. Since this is the app for delivery drivers this means that every time there's an issue I lose money. | Great money making app !!! | A++ | Its for ppl who work for free there is no money in this so called job its trash nothing good about it unless u like working for free and destroying your vehicle for free | ATTENTION ALL DRIVER LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH THEY WILL PURPOSELY GIVE YOU LONG DRIVES FOR LITTLE MONEY AND HAVE YOU SITTING AROUND FOR HOURS UNPAID SO IF YOU WANNA KEEP TOP DASHER ACCEPT EVERYTHING CAUSE THEY WILL MAKE YOU LOSE IT ON PURPOSE | easy to use! thank you! | Platinum driver orders are too small | greatest | lots of bugs and locks up","{""1"":25295,""2"":7174,""3"":13886,""4"":27137,""5"":265066}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","DoorDash","4672508238093661894","support@doordash.com","http://www.doordash.com","303 2nd St , Suite 800, San Francisco, California, 94107, United States","https://www.doordash.com/dasherprivacypolicy/","4672508238093661894","Business","BUSINESS","[{""name"":""Business"",""id"":""BUSINESS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/trfOy_Wg9gQTwGcoYJNushqXIV3xFhWBReAVWM5IPqspN5N811YhTKQCG48anNS13HE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/M5iOqLygrSm6C5BC1BAsrAfPAQvcEzxQp5awWu4ORtE3thpBntBRp2ESi7zrHT521jOM","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VJdqcls1THqk3dDpRedrQ66q7hSYb_L9LFYPJzbN72fw3EWQIC5kzBlCS0OcUcKemY4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KzL6V0_2dobTN7Vdze89dxQm5k7IMn93e0XaxMUT-fhgVMVpCLAaHqbxoTzEAk58aT4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CwQDMFfxtzNh7btu7KroT8mcK-cmLqMqAmrkgMp5tauJplfztW4J6wIzZ5_oS4pkwBk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JOeO6RHjqhww62cP6mpdsZu5dxVSBhIhg_-L58Y_2urTadozvS_to9rlRET3PBCac2w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uI4tCagZPXoI6JAd03k9kEjgW0kSVBh4a8SxD8UgJM6RAvzAGlMXk6tFkgvJEIip154"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CvhAgMrqDxkSu1jCpniSBmmOKeOr64wDmRRKrtVVjySS2brCU2RV0FavMWo5p22XzYo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1qdVuFLbrDDqDhTCkp5B_Wd448Cy7dhR8W8CpnI3pCRFsgEJoj2PET50_AFJvdkwKiU""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Dec 10, 2013",1714204989000,"7.72.7","- Minor fixes and stability improvements","[null]",false,false,false,"com.doordash.driverapp","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doordash.driverapp&hl=en&gl=US"
"WhatsApp Business","WhatsApp Business from Meta

WhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business. 

If you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.

In addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:

• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.

• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate when you're away or Greeting message to send your customers an introductory message when they first message you.

• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.

• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.

• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.

WhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.

*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.

Note: once you restore chat backup from WhatsApp Messenger to WhatsApp Business, you will no longer be able to restore it back to WhatsApp Messenger. If you would like to go back, we recommend that you copy the WhatsApp Messenger backup on your phone to your computer before you start using WhatsApp Business.

C'mon, it's not that hard to fix... | Nice | Good | Absolutely useless app doesn't even work when i copy the code, says incorrect and yes i put it in in time! | great apps and helpful | Everything was fine until it updated the logo. I usually recognize the app by the logo. And now I couldnt find my Google Authenticator as the logo turned out to be different. Indeed, when a doggy has nothing to do, it is leaking its balls.

The associates are always helpful! | I love the plants! | just outstanding | It only works half time and never works in store | Home away from home!!! l love this place!!! | great way to shop | Easy to navigate and works well. I especially like the store map and In Store View. Makes it a breeze to find what your looking for. | Very easy to navigate | seems like everytime I try to login I have trouble with the password and getting locked out. reset my pw at least 5 times in the last 2 months. an absolute nightmare, do better lowes | great way to shop! | Logging in sucks | I'm always their at Lowes,my brother is always their here in Madera, CA, at CLOVIS,CA HIS ALWAYS SHOPPING THEIR FOR HIS HOUSE, OUR HOUSE TOO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP | Can't sign in since last update. | awesome | Lowe's app is pretty cool. it's easy to use. you can find your items in store by aisle and bay number thru the app it gives you that much info. it's great. | Sucks no help at all!!!!!!!!! | It's ok but Lowes is a horrible place to shop if u need things delivered go somewhere else | SUPER NOSEY APP!!! Read what all of your info you give permissions for them to snoop if you use this app. APPALING | great selection, prices & service lately! | Thing takes forever to load anything if it even works at all. | Terrible staff wait forever when their paged guy in bulb section was absolutely useless. Didn't even help look for a bulb for ovens. | Unstable. Many errors from doing mundane tasks that should be easy. I keep receiving an ""internal service error"" message | The payment methods, managing gift cards and credit payments are not user friendly or intuitive. | Nice qpp | Truly a convenient app. | I had to return to do and the clerk helped me no problem but when he called for an assist to help me find the proper item he called twice and no one came and there was 5 employees in the Of the leaf floor and no one helped me. I have been spending a lot of money there lately and I expected better customer service. | Can't even purchase anything because I get an error message saying: ""An item has been added to or removed from this cart using a different browser or device. Return to cart to checkout."". Tried having an associate try to conduct the purchase for me but the live chat ended on its own and had the same issue with queue chat kicking me out after 3 times of waiting 20 minutes or so each time. Also finally got my item purchased the other day and it was canceled a day later saying the item is now out. | Been my place for 25 years to shop. Great bargains and great clearances. | App is easy and love same day shipping | There have been some minor improvements recently, but there is so much potential in this app. | good | Recently the new versions of this app have been having a terrible loading. Very frustrating,, needless to say I have been shopping at home depot a whole lot more. | Overall great store to shop and same great experience to order online! Great quality products and reasonable prices. | Easy to find what you need compared to other companies and easy to navigate and they support there veterans. | App won't load anything up, even while lowes on there wifi | Easy to order online just, but I wish they would give the military discount on all items. This would've been 5 stars if so... | Rather quick and easy to opporate. I didn't experience any issues. | love the curbside pickup option. | I've been using the app for a while, now all of a sudden it won't even let me log into the app. | Always needs me to log back in when I'm at the checkout with poor cell connection in order to get the QR code. | Thus takes forever to load the app never opens up | The Lowes app is so much better than Home Depot! | quick, easy, and painless. new best lowes experience | switching stores for pickup in the cart would be helpful. accessing the store map from a product page or cart would be another welcome addition. otherwise the app is functional without any consistent bugs in my couple years of use. | Sucks will not open | easy to use | What a terrible customer experience. Website failed, app failed too, required 2 step verification, I did, and it failed too... hire some IT folks or continue to lose business. Check out, forced me to sign in or create an account, both failed. The site and app are terribly slow, which is tolerable but, complete failure to acknowledge a customer and not permit product purchase, not acceptable. I spent hours to order some items, only to confirm it was that bad, it is!!! | this is for the Lowe's app. does not display store phone numbers. and the AI chat stands for actual idiot. no help at all | The new design of this app to incorporate the rewards program is horrible! To the Lowes developers: The customer does not want to have to struggle through multiple screens, prompts and marketing ads to get to the screen to scan the rewards QR code. Please consult the Kroger or Meijer app for direction on rewards programs in apps. | my order was cancelled due no reason and won't give me a reason | I like the quick pick up and purchase on line. Also the service from Robert one of the employees was very helpful. He helped me with my locker and the code. Lowes employees some of the best. | Has issues with payments. Mostly pay later but also credit card payments. When you go to make the payment, it gets approved but there is a disconnect back to the app. Now you have an approved loan, but it never gets charged | Had a hell of a time ordering on the app. You can't edit an address at all or add an address sometimes, or the app just spins and spins. Says free shipping, then adds the shipping when placing the order🤬 | Works great, no issues at all ...except it is hard to access my Lowe's credit card to make a payment, not an easy task at all. They should add a quick way to access it. | Way too slow to be useful. I'm not sure why but it often just gives me the spinning wheel of death and no search results. When it works it's good, but it often doesn't. | Have to uninstall & then installall & open again EVERY TIME I want to look up &/or purchase an item. | Way better app than Home Depot! | app seems buggy. works ok sometimes, then not at all. | easy-to-use web site | had a good experience with online order and pick up. I like the alternate pick up person option | Need Home improvement everything you need for a home | So far so good, Thanks . | I installed this on a friend's phone and tried to create an account. Tried three times and it was rejected every time with the world's stupidest and most useless error message: ""Oops, something went wrong. Please try again."" No, I'm not going to try again. Three strikes and you're out. Instead, I'm going to delete this garbage app. | Works well... When it works. This app seems to hang a lot when using it on my galaxy s23. | glitchy | It was super easy to place my order. I am looking forward to using my new appliances. | Don't know | Very nice | It took 35 minutes for curbside pickup to bring out my order after parking. And when I called the store, the IVR didn't even recognize my cell number even though it's clearly in my account. | Couldn't sign in because the sign in button never activated even though everything was filled out. Like the awful website, it fails at your location and always sets your store to the wrong one. Why they don't just associate the store that I HAVE SELECTED 100 TIMES to my account is beyond explanation. They made the lists less convenient. | I like the app | Sucks works sometimes Love the store. | The app is literally unusable. It used to be okay but it legit won't load a single item. I never review apps but I use Lowe's alllllll the time and the app awful. I had to uninstall it just so I could use the phones browser to look at Lowe's items. | local and great service | Really wish I could shop on the web page since the app doesn't seem to load. But every time I search or click on a department it opens the app which again, doesn't load. | App always slow no matter where I am. Even after update. Very inconvenient when trying to shop for home impertinent needs. | What a FRUSTRATING APP! It would be nice if the phone # for my local Lowe's (my chosen location) would be at the top. Then when I couldn't find what I was looking for (which I'd purchased there), I could easily call the store. When I did finally call the store, it took forever to speak to a real person! The computer voice kept asking me what I needed, but I didn't know what it was called, and I'd tried looking by everything. I bought it at Lowe's. | So easy to use and allows for easy ready-to-go pickups. Just pay attention to what you're ordering. | Just spins and spins half the time | awesome store | like the website few things I don't like. looking at a item and click on it then hit the back button it won't take me exactly back to that item . could use a little bit more description in certain items. and 90% of the time cannot get the videos to play that's a bummer. do not like having to go elsewhere to look at a video of a product. | Nike store | My experience with lowes is amazing | Very information on however I would have appreciated more information regarding the items in detail. | Great | very convenient and conveniently easy, great job and thanks everyone 👍 | easy and fast, quick delivery in 2 days, and low delivery cost | my favorite store | Easy to order plus godd additional discount for my Lowes Card. | Lowe is one of my favorite stores i love to shop at. | Good | Best update ever | Search results are too slow | Annoying pop up ad as soon as you open app | love the ease of using curbside pickup on the app for quick needs. I can get what I need and send my 16 yr old to pickup the order without having to stop working on the job I'm doing and I dont have to try to explain to my kid what I need. | I like the app when it works but 9 out of 10 it just cycles and won't even open | Very easy to use and compare items. Easy to do pickup orders! Really appreciate the in store location when shopping in store. | Very user unfriendly with no way of talking to a real person | They are getting better but still need to drop the locker and only do curbside. | Great app for shopping.

A first class, no nonsense, efficient service every time. Highly recommend. | ""We're sorry, something went wrong on our end"" | the best services | Need to contact someone, Need a phone number. | I love to have all my travel information in one place. | Always a breeze to use. | Kind of stupid, my wife booked a trip for me, I can locate the trip using her email but I can't save it in my trips | The app is very easy to use! | so far so good all 😁 😁 | Canadian here. After using the app for 6 years without issue, I recently went to book a hotel and the app had changed my location to USA for some reason. Rather than showing the currency as USD, it simply showed a $ sign and I mistakenly assumed that my app was still in CAD, like it had been for 6 years prior. Instead, I booked a hotel for a good rate and was pleased. Was very displeased to find the increased rate when I showed up at hotel. I'm out. | I was not given the information to cancel my reservation and be refunded. I will never use Expedia again. | BC ccacrs d | good site for traveling. | not working for car reservation | always helpful and great choices! | Love the app. Always find deals on great stays. | Very good | Easy to use and the prices can't be beat. I have been using Expedia to plan my vacations for years. | easy to find tickets and cheap flights | User friendly, it's great 😃 | They'll cancel your booking without any reason and without any prior information. No one responds on their customer care number. They take no interest in your problems | I booked a flight on the web page and the app showed my flight for about 10 seconds, then showed the ""Oops something went wrong"" page and now the app claims I have no bookings on two different devices, even after reinstalling. Glad I have an old fashioned e-mail confirmation of my flight! The app has now been uninstalled, fix your garbage app, please! | horrible customer service and support. Not able to talk to a person. | I was overcharged by just over $130 using Expedia. I spoke with customer support to figure out what the fees were for. I even sent a copy of my reciept from the hotel showing the actual cost. They only offered to look into refunding, but denied it. Even a partial refund was denied. The points system is a joke too unless you travel often (more than 3 times a year) and/or outside your country. I was a loyal customer for several years, but never again. This company puts profits over people. | Easy and efficient.y | Good website to navigate, and customer service, prices are very competitive. | grateful to off found you | Easy to reserve, pick-up and drop-off. | My go-to to book ANY trip! | Don't like their return policy and can be run around in order to get a refund or credit. | never a glitch always great deals | wow | I normally fly with jetblue, but on occasion, I find better prices in Expedia. | fantastic, i uses for all my travels!!! ufff | Beautiful everything was perfect | Cannot beet the savings❣️ | love it | 95% of the time, Expedia offers the best prices period! Customer service is top notch! The bundling option saves so much money! I go to Expedia 1st, then I check everybody else, and then, I'm right back with Expedia. | Amazing App. Has saved me a lot of $$$ | Not able to login, tried several time....😢🥺 | Easy as pick, and click, click, done | great customer service and best prices with reliable airlines and hotels! | great and easy | Been using Expedia for years. Easy to use app and good prices. | Easy booking. Thanks | I can't search flights. I type the city but nothing happen | great | reliable | was awesome, little effort 👌 | I can no longer log in. The app has stopped recognizing my Gmail account or my actual login credentials. Prior to this, I found the app very convenient, handy, and intuitive. I've booked a ton of trips through them. They web page still works fine. | wonderful comparisons | Been using Expedia to book flights, hotels, cars and packages for over 10 yrs. Never had any issues and customer service has always been helpful when I need them. I never use anything else. | I was quoted a price that went upon payment as apparently Expedia give you the motels price. They then on more to pay Expedia on top of this.. Cheaper not to use Expedia - no deals with them in fact costs more to use Expedia | Supper buggy can't book anything on this trash app | easy | Horrible app. makes errors on a regular basis.you will lose a lot of money if you try to book using this app. stay away. | I've been using Expedia for years. I always like how convenient and acceptable the prices are. really great for last minute searches and I've only needed to use assistance once and all of these years. | It's the original and still the best travel booking app in my opinion. Enough said. | very easy to book flights | Awesome site to use when planning trips. | poor on costumer service | prompted to | acceptable prices , customer friendly app. | Easy to work around | The puzzles to prove I was not a bot made the app unusable. I would get verified, the screen would load, and then go back to doing a puzzle to prove I wasn't a bot. The process just kept repeating like a glitch. I had it less than 24 hours and deleted it. | Used to love the app, hate the changes that were made and now it has logged me out and will NOT allow me to log back in to my account. I've cleared history/cashe, I've rebooted my phone and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and nothing works. Very unhappy with this app right now. | Half the time the app won't let me enter a destination for a hotel search making it utterly useless. | 👍🏽 | Only lets you choose a 29 day window, if you like to go somewhere for more than a few weeks then you can't do it through this site. Also, prices are cheaper individually (through hotel directly and flight directly through their own sites) for the same dates and locations. Two stars because I used to enjoy this site when I didn't know how to book different aspects of my travel for myself but now it's not something I'll use because there are better prices to be found with little research. | unable to connect the trip itinerary from website to app, will probably just continue to use the website | easy to use | hard to navigate, won't keep my current screen open | Best App for Flights and Hotels | I love it ❤️ | love that I can easily cancel as needed. | easy and life saving | The app isn't working. Everytime I sign in it freezes. | I love how Expedia fine great hotels | Expedia used to protect and support customers when booking through them. I used them since the beginning. Nowadays, we get to our Destination and find out about all of the additional, non disclosed fees such as that 50USD cleaning fee per day. From now on, I'll be booking everything myself to avoid surprises. | excellent app | Excellent fare choices and prices! | I only use expedia! for domestic AND international travel. | Easy to use app. Great way to find accommodation quickly. | I love discounts and convenience, especially when making last-minute plans. | setup hotel stay for vacation. last year. When the time to go came, I came down with a case of covid. but had no problem changing reservations. | very good | ease of use | No good. | thanks for training Expedia😀 | cheap, quick, easy | Easy to use, good information on web site. | Expedia has saved me money a few times especially on last minute issues. | love Expedia. | love it | easy to use | Basically a scam.

Every time I try to do anything I end up stuck on a loading screen. ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE. only reason worth having is to get into the draft. Which I may not be able to get into because your stupid application doesn't work. | Great experience | This is awful I have had a hard time registering and never could figure out to register my 14year old son. This is not an easy thing to do for people that don't have smart phones and a child who is Austin and can't help. I can't believe the NFL has left so many of us out who are not technology inclined. I bet I have tried 15 to20 times to do this and can't get it right. Yes I know there is only a few of us fossils around but we deserve to be able to enjoy this experience also but are being denie | Cannot get past cover page | The best | New to me | I'm unable to open the app? | I picked the 2 email addresses offered. It said it could not find them. I then manually entered my gmail address and it could not find that one either. If it offers known email addresses, then why can't it find them? Awful app. I wondered why it got so many 1-star reviews. Now I know. | Doesn't work | WILL NOT LET ME CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR LOG IN | Unable.to load | App is a joke. Stuck on the login screen. Waste of time. | Can't even get through tried several times 😞. | terrible app. does not work at all. screw the NFL and their draft. I live in Detroit and not going to this. might have been fun | Can't get pass Closer to action page. Please fix it | Have signed in at least 3 times but still cannot get a QR code So frustrated got an email stating thanks for registering for the draft | So far so good! | Love it 🥰 | This app is horrible. Will not let you navigate anywhere! | I cannot register, everytime I sign up the app says something went wrong. | This app doesn't work at all, I've tried several times to install and all it does is freeze up... | Does not give you access to get tickets | Won't download... | Terrible download won't show I got my pass. Won't send this lol | App opens to main screen and nothing works from there | I have downloaded this app 5 times to get a ticket to the draft and I can't get past the first screen. This is ridiculous. Fix your issues. | This app just doesn't work 😕 😒 and I am getting in my feelings because I really want to go downtown and not feel lost 🙃 | Beautiful | I have not received my QR code yet. When and how will get your gifts | I registered a few weeks ago, now the app won't even let me in. It just keeps going back to register. I even tried deleting app and reinstalling, now it wont even complete registration. Draft finally comes to my city and I'm going to miss out on the whole experience. The NFL needs to do better. I've read others having this same issue. I hope nobody coming from out of town has this experience after spending all that travel and lodging expenses. | Absolutely Horrible....You Can't Download You're One Day Pass on Google with Certain Samsung Phones! | App has bugs for android. Tried to reinstall, and it is stuck on one page. | App will not let me register Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times | Good | Screen keeps freezing when I open the app. | Good APP | I can't my ticket for entry to the draft | How does this work again ? Maybe I'm stupid ? Does anyone have any idea how things work ? It appears as though the NFL certainly doesn't. And what about for people that don't know how to use an app ? Blessed be the misguided. | Terrible I got nothing but something about privacy. I've Uninstaller several times, still nothing, why? | Very easy to navigate.... I'll see you downtown All 3days | App will not open 😞 | SUCKS! Doesn't work on android phones | Looking forward to the good times | I cannot get my QR Code for the draft. Please fix this app | Doesn't work, froze on first screen. So frustrating! | Don't get this app. At all | I agree with the other one star reviews. It doesn't work on newer phones. But I loaded it on to a 7 year old phone and it works perfectly. | I can't get online | Does not work as intended. It just sends you to their website page. App is garbage. | N/A | Can't get bar code | Previously downloaded the app for the NFL Draft but can't access information on the app. There is no way to get off the this ""Closer to action"" screen. I've reinstall the app 3 times. No luck. Please correct these errors | Outstanding | I have my QR code but I can't see what I reserved. | Doesn't work. I registered weeks ago but app has no where to just sign in -- tries to make you register again and then doesn't work. Worthless. Guess I don't get to go to the draft. | It's not working g | Unable to open. Tried 3 times page will not load | Great | I have installed and Uninstalled this app at least 3 times and it just is not working; it just clicks by really quick when I'm asked to do this or do that. This needs to be fixed. | Awful. Required for the draft so I got it and signed up. Landing page looks like the mobile version of the website asking me to...download the app to register, while I'm looking at this screen IN the app? Makes no sense, not intuitive, just want to get a screen cap of my QR code but there is zero direction as to where on this on this embedded website in the mobile app it can be found | App froze up.

But after one backward press the notification vanishes and I am unable to message newly added people. Requesting you to keep that notification on permanent basis so that we all can message them without loosing their notification. Thank you | Nice platform | The app has been working very well for years on my phone until recently I have been having issues with accessing my account through the android app for weeks now. I get stuck at the point of phone number verification - sending a code to my phone number and never was there a time after several attempts was this code received on my phone line, even tried phone calls, none at all. Can you please look into this. I have a screenshot but can attach here | Nice App for professionals | I've used LinkedIn for a long time and still like to use it. One thing I've been missing though is that it used to tell me WHEN I connected with someone, a feature that I actually very much liked. It placed a person and contact into a time and space context for me. Perhaps this could be introduced again? I'm sure (well, I assume) the data behind this still exists, no? | Your app repeats the jobs shown under jobs section while scrolling down to look for other jobs. Show me jobs listed instead if repeating the same list of jobs again. This problem is not present when i go to linkedin via browser, so it's the app problem. It's annoying. There are many jobs listed for a query which you can only find using 'see similar jobs' option.

Even after an accident left me physically disabled I continue to use this platform, mainly to keep up with the times and continue to learn. I would highly suggest this social media platform to anyone, not just business people. | A professional and friendly platform especially for recruitment | Hello sir | Vgood | Good | Absolutely trash app and trash company meta, horrible app that wastes your time.

What does this puzzle mean to you? Provide OTP is verifying. | The identity verification system is unfair to some countries, if you close your account while you live in one of the countries that are not supported by their system, you can no longer access your account and data. | I keep getting email that my password has been change or a new device is login in when I never made an account with you guys in the first place and having to upload documents online to prove its me when you have no documents that prove its me online in the first place | Very helpful application | Lots of potential job opportunities | Predatory, Logged in once or twice and have blocked my card for this exact kind of behavior.

Also not having option ""mark unread"" isn't ok nowadays. And there is new terrible bug: it somehow vibrates on new messages, when my phone in DND mode. Maybe for started contracts only, but still it's terrible! | I love it. For group chats could we please also include a poll feature and a reminder feature? | Very great massaging app simple fast responding, clear HD voice calls | Someone else signed up for signal app on my android no I can't control the app | So good | Great app | 👍 | 😳 wow | Great messaging app | I love you | Good | I would rate it as five stars, but the lack of runtime permissions is a security problem. I find that it goes against the whole point of this app. Edit: I should have edited it a long time ago because now it has runtime permissions. | It was really nice... | I'm new with the app but it'd good as of now there's no problems for the moment | It sucks | like it very much | Great experience. All data is stored locally, not on any cloud, and is encrypted. | Very goodnight | App works fine just the way I like it. | First time using reason behind its because of girl,but yet still it's alright......keep it up...... | Its easy to connect friend | Chat colours are back-to-front; everyone else's bubbles are grey and to difficult to distinguish in group chats. I already know which bubbles are mine, they're the only ones aligned to the right. | It's a wonderful app and I like that it is encrypyef | If i find out this is JW, JK, BB, SD and, or that wee weed T up hill then i assure you, you will wish it was Andy J downloading your app Stephanie... HamzaOfTheDump aswell. | Security is okay. But sometimes it takes HOURS for my messages to be delivered. That's so great in a messaging service | It works great but now I cannot get back on it | Nice app | Great app 👍🏼😁 | Amazing 👏 | Very informative | 5 star express ap.expo. | A solid clean and easy to use messaging app. An ideal drop-in replacement for WhatsApp in my case as I was looking for a more secure alternative | Awesome | It has been fun and the graphics are great. | Easy to navigate and a very clean and simple appearance | Good experience | Excellent | OK. | Odličan! | Better than the crowded and shady WhatsApp | Great . | Sensitive to user needs through improvements! | It's great I meet my king on this app | I wont a Sadia doll im fakin as shed mama Saba | The best in class app for privacy, and encryption out there. Now that disposable usernames are available you don't need to provide a phone number. 👍 | I accidentally clicked delete for me instead of delete for everyone. Maybe it's just me but the fact that the option of deleting messages that I wrote myself so I can't see them anymore but everyone else can even exists is extremely retarded. | Solid app | Great app | Excellent and I enjoy the site | Faltu Application h | Used for scamming me and a horrible experience | Reliable, works great | Exactly what an IM app should be, nothing more nothing less | Signal Network Blocked in Portugal, fix it please, i need it fixed, please. | Very good app. I use this the most for regular texting. I just wish it had the ability to make personal ringtone notifications for different people. Other than that, I highly recommend this app for everyday use it's the best one. | Nice | Unoptimal and full of sketchy people. | App who can help you on urgent time very good app | Simple | Good | Love this app! The video calls are so good! And pictures, videos etc upload quickly. Highly recommend Signal! | Excellent | This app keeps stopping can't get in touch with my friends please let me know what's going on and please fix it | Strange program. It will not access my contacts list in spite of permission to do so. Web help suggestions are of zero help. I can't even dial a number manually (gives me a message that number is not a Signal user). I'm dumbfounded so far. Update: This program is useless for sending texts and making phone calls unless the party you are contacting is a Signal user, too. This app will not replace your default phone and text apps. The developers should have made that clear. | Very useful app , this app change my life i feel connected to my husband Thank you signal , please add the feature we can show last seen please add last seen feature | I really love this app. you can add your friends and mostly your families on this app. | Best competitor of Whatsapp and having hight security ... | Excellent security, easy to use, customizable conversation backgrounds, sounds and colours! Would love to see polls added for group chats | Very good | Love the ability to respond to messages with an emoji sticker (as opposed to an emoji message). Makes it easy to keep track of conversation flow! | Sucks | First time users app is good after verification am not a robot 👍 | Great IM app. I love the privacy focus. | I like the privacy of it | I would lower my previous review if possible. The new ""security"" changes have enabled harassment and scammers. It's ridiculous you can't see what groups you have in common with someone or even tell if you know them. - The new color changes are sooo bad!!! I rely heavily on the chat bubble color differentiation to keep chats straight. I have an active work chat with 30 people, and now it's just a huge blob of one color. | It's a good app. Has one bug that is annoying and I wish I had screen sharing, but other than that, it suits my needs over the alternatives. | Very fast and reliable 🫠🫠 | Comfortable app I try | App is pretty good on delivery of messages and easy to read . Good on pictures and stickers. | Good | What a disappointment that i cant link android tablet as secondary device (really big). | Love it for it's privacy and security measures | Love how the app is working for our privacy 🔏 | Excellent | Cool app | What'sapp ki new privacy aayi h isliye ye install kr rha hu.. bhai ab aage chal ke tum b uski tarah mat krne lagna please 🙏😂 baaki bas baat krne se matlb kispe b kro 🙌 | That's good old so far | good for communication | It's amazing.

Now I have to go thru all these hoops an I still get nowhere.I GOING TO DELETE SOON 😞 | love the information it provides. | Easy to use! | love this you can check, ur, account, and keep improving your credit score. | App with convenient and relevant information that you can reference to improve your financial footprint. | credit karma does give you your credit bureau scores . it is a scam all it does is incessantly tries to sell you credit card offers that are so horrendous it's not even funny buyers beware | P ź deferred d5⁵a 5x4 Reese Reese Reese | Why are you all saying I have 2 credit cards? I only have one. If I find out you all got fooled by someone trying to open a card in my name I'm going to be pissed! To dev: You're missing my point. I only have one card and never applied for another one. Fix it! Oh that's right, you corporations don't have to take personal responsibility for your mistakes. Stuff like this wouldn't happen if Credit Karma didn't sell our info to 3rd parties for a profit, so, yes, it is Credit Karma's fault. | great app | very good and helpful | Helps me focus on paying my debts off! | Hello write to many times never response no email no chat becuase I have not apply for a card on your app since it was bought so many weir things happen ...... | keep me updated | Absolute trash now, all ads. Pushing credit cards and loans in an irresponsible, predatory, unnecessary way. Most of the previous features are either gutted, very well hidden, or gone entirely. The ""chat with penny"" feature is a joke, you can't type anything and you're given the choice of one button at a time to respond to Penny, like ""cool."" I thought mint was bad, but this monstrosity is loads worse - the worst of both apps, squished into one. | Intuit Credit Karma's main purpose is not budgeting. It is to get you to buy credit cards! MINT without CK was 100 times better! READ THE NEWS! Credit Karma is being bought to task for problems with their guaranteed credit card advertising! CK adverts make it hard to play games because their commercials take you to PlayStore. Took me pressing the X five times to get back to the game. | It's just a bunch of ads. It keeps giving me errors connecting to my accounts and still doesn't work even after I re-enter my usernames and passwords. | I miss mint. Credit Karma is meh and inaccurate at actual credit score, but close enough. Mint was a much better budgeting app. I don't even look at CK anymore. | App works great when it connects, but occasionally has connectivity issues. Not connecting, need to use a browser instead. Edit 2024: App functionality improved, but now way too many ads. | Used mint to track my spending I can't even do that with this app. It's just advertising cards and insurance what can I even do with this app other than that? | I'm | What a great service this is, constant updates on your score, if something doesn't seem right they inquire I to it to be sure it is correct reporting. They also give you ways to increase your score, and tells you about each and every account that you have both good and bad accounts if any. a highly recommend | Best app for reporting all negative activities. You will know any time something is charged to your credit cards. | Great | Too many ads and much more difficult to navigate compared to mint. | Thanks for hurting me | U won't let off the site after I hit the x to exit besides I already have ur app | This app and website are never correct when looking at your credit score. | Horrible I ask for a replacement card to be sent to my address: 5890 Riverdale Apt (P6) 30349, I got the run around NOONE COULD HELP ME, recovery didn't help ,online info kept kicking me out, tried telling customer service, she kept referring to recovery NO HELP ONLINE APP TO RECOVERY ACCT. DOES NOT WORK..SOMETHING SO EASY IS MADE TO BE SO HARD . JUST NEED A NEW CARD MINE WAS LOST, HORRIBLE SERVICE | Terrible downgrade from mint. Its all just ads. Doesnt give you good breakdowns, spending tracking or anything else i used to use. | Your algorithm is not reporting accurate information. You are offering a secure or personal loan from specific lenders or financial companies who are not offering personal loans or secure loans but only offer auto refinancing to assist with credit card hardship. Now, my credit took a hard inquiry hit because of your bad advice. I am working on fixing my credit, and all your recommended solutions are making it worse. You might want to remove OneMain Financial from your offers algorithm. | These credit scores are at least 18-45 points under the actual scores with the 3 Credit Bureaus. | CK gives me my current credit score. But seems all the recommended lenders they work with has never been approved for me...even though it says acception for me is excellent. I fill out the application and never hear back from them and no card comes in mail | The worst. Forgot password. Request reset email. One not sent. Enter email and last 4. Now comes to picture screen then just processes. Better than before. Just said whoops. No customer service contact other than email. Frustrating, app not working. Contact support is the answer. I have and they were no help. Keep sending support emails. Like I haven't sent numerous emails already. Get a clue. Lucky I have to give a star. Because you deserve 0 stars. | Always having technical difficulties when trying to log in | ??? Entertainment Purposes Only??? I'm glad to hear that. My FICO score is 718. Credit Karma has me at 632. That's a 96 point difference. Credit Karma is waaay off the mark. Way off... UPDATE: FICO is what the banks and most auto lenders go through making them the standard. CK is for entertainment purposes as stated in your EULA. Nice try, try again | would be 5 star but is a month behind actual ratings UPDATE. If i log into my equifax/transunion the scores there are different then Credit Karmas | nice job 👏🏽 | Absolutely awful compared to the legacy Mint application. Beyond the lack of basic functionality and features you would expect, there is no way to trace or diagnose changes in the information they give you. The UI/UX is horrible and ads take up so much space. | I have nothing but good thing to say,Credit Karma keeps me updated on my scores,but credit karma does not always coincide with the big 3 AGENTCEY'S. THE SEVERAL AGENCY'S THAT REPORT, TRANSUNION, EQUIFAX, ARE EXPERIAN = 3 MAIN CREDIT RATINGS. Credit Karma does give advise on your scores,how to increase scores,help with your payment schedule,& methods,,they help my score to 786, but I get my 800 score one day. Higher scores can give you lower interest rates on cards available. | wonderful just wonderful | I jj.jjbk 5 id,k.om Cmb@, 7n,$2s u.qcskil z | Great Updates | DON'T use the credit builder service. An error on their part has made my credit score go down. My account was closed due to inactivity even though I have PROOF that I was meeting the activity requirements (use it once every 3 months). And support claims it can't be fixed Everything was great with Seedfi, I don't know why they switched it over to Credit Karma. It's 10x more difficult now. It only lets you pay money back from a Credit Karma spend account rather than any bank. Overall, it sucks | don't want my personal info released to public. | I'm not a fan of the latest update | CK IS A GREAT APP which allows customers to keep up with their credit and allows them resources to rebuild credit | Information for free to help you understand what is going on with your credit health. | it's really easy to use and has everything you want to use on the app even things you didn't know you wanted to use lol | My credit report is not updating | great app and convenient | nice app | Wanted to check my credit score,couldn't get logged in, someone fraudulently used an email I never had, sent documents to prove who I was, it's been a month and the matter is still not resolved and I can't log in | Horrible customer service with the banking (credit karma money) app. Kept my money from me, my paycheck that I deposited and was promised funds availability in 24 hours they then changed it after I submitted it and told me I couldn't access it for a whole week. Now they're adding 2 more days before I'll be able to access funds. I could have took that check to the bank or walmart for that matter and had cash in my hand that day. Customer support basically laughed at my kids having to go hungry | I want this off my phone very annoying | tells me about my credit score, they also offer tips. they can also help with getting quotes from car insurance companies, and apply for different credit cards right on the app. I would 100% recommend this app for people focusing on their finances, and it keeps things organized. | I've learned a great deal, and definitely increased my credit score with Credit Karma. The only negative I have is about the Destiny/Genesis card that wS then bought out by Concora. STAY AWAY FROM THAT ONE!! Then I was in position to get a personal loan. My phone was on someone else's plan. They dropped the plan with no notice. My credentials were not enough to satisfy CK of who I was, even after more than 5 years. I got SCREWED!!! | Avoid this app!! Save yourself the time and trouble!! Terrible!!! My account was hacked and after what took forever to get my money back, with a new account, new email, new everything only to have it hacked AGAIN less than 12 hours later!! Their fraud team only responds by email when they can. They do not listen to their customers!! Make you feel so unimportant. Act like they just do not care. I would not recommend to anyone!! Proceed with caution if you do choose this!! Negative 5 if I could. | Just do it | This app is just a data huffing ad jockey. I want mint back you absolute clowns. | Save your time and avoid this app. Bait and switch at its finest. Mint was a great experience and I was forced into this app while being told this would be an improvement. It's not and now I'm second guessing everything Intuit. We are very likely done with Turbo Tax too because I've lost trust in the whole company now. Don't believe the average app rating the app store shows. Look at all the poor reviews with detail. | Help me raise my credit score plus they are really informative | The only real financial app they are to check credit scores. | I love it | I don't like this it's giving me problems on my phone | Same as all the other recent 1 Star reviews. I loved Mint and used it to track my finances, now the app is just a bunch of adds. Worthless to me. Credit Karma did a terrible job with this. | the suggested credit cards are a ripped off | so far so great. | Attempted to create an account, but when they asked for me to verify my ID, it was able to snap a photo of the back, but for some reason it was impossible to get a picture of the front. i can confirm it wasn't a problem with my phone because i had recently upgraded from a Pixel 4a to a Pixel 7 since the first attempt at making an account, and i had the same issue on the Pixel 7. | Since being bought by Intuit, the information you are reporting is slow and outdated. Much much worse reporting than previous to this acquisition. Will likely quit and find another service. | the free version of the app from turbo tax helped me a lot with my credit | This is by no means an alternative to mint. They also haven't deleted my data since my request to over a month ago and are hanging up on my phone calls. | cash backing | It's ease to check your credit score often. | Thank you for all your help | The only thing that I don't like is that I can't change my occupation. | cool app | helps to know your worth | great credit tracker | It's as good as advertised. Helped get me a couple credit cards and with responsible use, got my credit up over 100 pts in a year | credit score is not accurate. | very prompt an informative | keep the good work coming do better everyday for everyone always.💯💯💯","{""1"":94017,""2"":26848,""3"":87620,""4"":318362,""5"":2299437}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Credit Karma, LLC","Credit+Karma,+LLC","AppSupport@creditkarma.com","https://www.creditkarma.com","1100 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607","http://www.creditkarma.com/about/privacy","Credit+Karma,+LLC","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/awnVMi-BtmYLp6lgF19Qv0McVObf53HW7HQX7XY_cE7P6F9C6D7boWEtWqsmpaUTI68","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QcMnbNmI49Y3wbqy11HzPxcubwT1G5Tu-Kd3uRP89IPnzcoCBiPGoQCABwqTvrC_FEY","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/o9II2sSa6Dvqsr0He2c-gRZaGZ7K4kCCnhNWT_NvE6oqmw5vTk8hloTCuLBZqp2cg0DR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AxE44uFf2ZewI_CgIUQSQMt9E2U97J1Yf_Oyw2Eti78IvMk_x44DMPDOfqN2ONwg2g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QdeSqaQBbfiSVMH6CrA7Xwpy6gSg9N0YvuBVckCtTfAn8HkF5yzBvB6NHrxK77nVMkI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oZ8n032XUjbpnoPKcQurudq8u9dVCbX5PvJlrMyacKJZ1wnhOw32DPOub59tlDIT3T8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BXlEh-8VF0Yx1GhdSOWAj6Eaf_2nGl7pkhNIYvR5j6Ezw8NJX_d4m8PAqpjsHKysPw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xzmyH5bTMTl33w4wHNhkcwuOvcCN9Hy1z70rqDEltJPJ5e3IFqpvDLZIwsaDCcyR6Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zTYmYEZJIPolSBmZ-lTKjLEH_rbilCaB8Gtw6WbAUUCdhcO4o-ARQF71V1u8CcJphBdr"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dQEloy0A1bCNLxZi2WM-MqPMIWLX0WPI8zW95gLTn42U8wYhyxlxumSZN-SnsOjolg4X""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,"Feb 28, 2013",1713902309000,"24.17.1","Thanks for using Credit Karma!<br><br>Our app is regularly updated to make it easier for you to track your financial progress.

Thank for everything ❤️🙏 | Great tool to use for communications, appointments, paying any payments due, reviewing your visit summary. | Love it | It is so convient I love it | I love all the freedom I get with this app. | Not only is it easy and intuitive to use, it really helped me when I was out of state visiting family and had to go to the ER. I was able to create an account at the local hospital, and link them, so that the medical personnel there were able to see my history - and when I came home, my Dr already had everything about the ER visit and was able to very easily follow up. That isABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING!not even a decade ago, that would have AT BEST taken WEEKS - if the records got to my Dr at all! | Great App. I use it every time that I have an appointment or need to see test results, etc. | Excellent | I love that i can go and cheek my results. its very comforting for me. | Excellent | This app has been wonderful. I have quick communication with all my medical providers and almost immediate reports after medical tests. It's a godsend! | Easy to use and nice to see results show up to quickly. | Great health communications app! | Often repetive without detail or analysis. Perfunctory results. GOOD FOR REQUESTING PRESCRIPTION REFILLS. POOR LISTING & UPDATING OF MEDICATIONS. SLOW RESPONSE TIMES. TEST RESULTS LATE AND OFTEN INCOMPLETE: INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS VERY LACKING & GENERALLY INSUFFIICIENT.

Covers multiple providers. Appointments, Labs all in one place. | Love it. Nice to have test results and explanations for future reference. | Bloody awful. | I'm grateful for this app and being able to keep track of medical information | Ever since this MyChart came out, it has made a Hugh difference in letting my Dr know what's going on with me. Thank you. I really love this App | I can see all my medications, my doctor's appointment and everything else. | Since the recent changes forcing a secondary verification, I have had a frustrating time logging in. It will not accept the code sent. After 5 tries and 5 different codes, finally success. This is unacceptable. This was on my phone. I haven't tried my computer as of yet. I hope for a better experience. | Once I made a password that I can remember, lol, the App is very easy to use. If I can do it, anyone can 😁 | Great app easy to use | I like using this app. Usually you get information before the doctor can get back to you. | Love love this new app. Very easy to communicate with ALL of your doctors from 2 different hospitals if you need that. | ALWAYS have 2 way talks with all medical staff. | This app is faulty as all get out! The app, I have to enter username, password, code etc. each time I use it. Really, each time?!! The Google search MyChart, I have to reenter my username and password just because I clear my cache.

This is just the username password run around only. I'm running out of characters with way more to say!!!! | MyChart has kept me up to date on appointments, labs and reports from the doctors. Love it. | I am totally frustrated with this app. I receive an email saying to go to this app to complete the e-concent. I cannot find it. I am told I can download the pre-op order for labs ... all I find is the order I was told was incorrect. So far I have not found this app useful for anything but wasting my time and making me want to cry. | Always enjoy using my chart. It should be the national communications of the medical community. | This is a great app for recording medical information an communicating with your health care providers. | I'd love to be an engineer for EPIC. They're badass. | My visits have been very pleasant. The staff is extremely knowledgeable on the tests and procedures. From check-in to Radiology dept. I have no concerns regarding staff's ability. | Very efficient and convenient. Puts all my medical information and options in one place and at my fingertips | ITS Easy AND very clear | Very convenient | I'd be lost without MyChart. I see about 12 different doctors and all but 2 use MyChart. It's fantastic to try my different test results and spots. Doctors communicate through the app and I can even renew most off my meds easily. | I love this app. The ease of scheduling and / or canceling an appt is great. | Good App | This app helps keep you informed abouts doctor appointments and you can message the doctor sometimes they'll don't need have you come in for an appointment. | Very easy to use and understand. | Great | Easy and easy | Very useful all at finger tip. Thank you great work | Easy to navigate, good all in one app, and love the easy access to scheduling, notes to Dr's, test results, and medications. Good all round application. | The app is easy to use and effective | Love the timely updates | Love it, easy to use and everything at my fingertips | So , far ... I have no major complaints .. where my MyChart App. .. is concerned ! | Comprehensive review | It's not very fast and it can be annoying to remember the password. There are strict password requirements but for some reason the password manager doesn't recognize what app is saving the password. Once I figured out where it was actually saving it, it became easier but probably the first 10 times I opened the app, I had to reset it first. | I like the ability to make Dr appts, simple med refills, ask questions and read results in almost real time. | Still trying to access Info. I've recieved emails about an appt. With no information except date and time. Whom is it with and where | I'm giving mychart 5 stars for ease of use, easy to understand and a great short cut between myself and my drs!! Gotta love that!! | It's simple to understand and convenient to use. | Nice way to keep informed of appointments, tests and notes from visits... | Really fast and very beneficial! | Terrible. Cannot find my location. Doesn't recognize my zip code. Provides no scheduling options other than Covid vaccine, On-demand video visit, Urgent care & mammography screening. What about knee pain, feminine care, ear nose & throat, general practitioner visits, etc? The ""Get Estimate"" function goes to a blank screen. So many bugs! | This app is so convenient and easy to navigate through. I highly recommend this app, it keeps track of everything between you and your provider. You can request an appointment with out you having to call. You can make a payment or even check your prescriptions. Best thing is, all your providers can finally be on one accord concerning your health. | 👍🏾 great I can view my chart record make appointment | Best portal ever. | Very easy to get to. Very informative | Was very fast and easy to get seen. I was taken care of instantly | Too much detail and repitition. | Absolute trash | I love being able to get my lab results within a few hours, ask for refills and send notes to my doc easily | Very informative | Too much trouble login in. | This is a great thing to have it helps u remember ur appointment, helps u see what medicine u r on so u don't have to remember, doctor's office or the hospitals can look it up to see it is. It helps me check out the results of a test that doctor ordered for me. I think this is a wonderful app to have because it reminds u of ur appointments and it will send u a message a few days before to remind u to confirm the appointment | Really great app for appointments and test results I like that I can view the results. | I use to like this app...not any more. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because SOMETIMES it takes my password. | I love mychart. Dr. office's are busy. Mychart gives patients the opportunity to view results without waiting for the phone call from the Dr's office. Sometimes, when that important call comes in we are to busy to answer. Mychart is an awesome interim. | This app works great for me. Easy to use. | We received help from a very nice Lady. | Does not take information | Very nice | This is a very useful App. Easy to find meds we take & we can order med refills in My Chart. We can schedule appointments or leave a message for our Doc or their PAs. The best feature, can look up all chart entries from various locations that share files. One can see blood work, x-ray, CT and other services too. Nice! 48 hrs or less Im not an App wizard or nerd by any standards. However, I have learned to navigate the features in this app easily. It's very intuitive too. Try it out yes? | Glitchy. Cannot access my medical records!!!!! | It is very practical and time saving method. Being able to see the chart and Communicate with my providers is wonderful. | When I do 'forgot username', I don't get anything on my email address. | trash. does no t work | VERY easy to use, I can find anything and everything I need for my son and daughter's records if needed. | Great app | Love MyChart! Appts, meds, and test results are right there. Quick and easy. | Love it | Access to answers to any questions I may have regarding my care, including billing. Direct and clear instructions for its use. | I love my shark it helps me with appointments messages to doctors medication refills making payments I love love my heart I love my doctors and I love the nurses sometimes the front office ladies can be rude and unapproachable, but I can overlook that sometimes. | 1) I'm having difficulty updating my Medical History. (,Has to have Office Staff put some in thru their Access) 2) Messaging my different Drs. has been difficult @ times & not getting satisfactory timely replies (24 + hrs). | Organized and easy to understand. Great app. | Great information at your finger tips! | it's great let's me sign in to appointment before I even get to counter. You can add your appointments to your calander and all you after visits and appointments are in one place. You can see your test results as soon as they come in. This is a very handy app. | Great","{""1"":9767,""2"":4153,""3"":5591,""4"":16261,""5"":143845}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Epic Systems Corporation","Epic+Systems+Corporation","mychartsupport@epic.com","http://www.epic.com",,"https://www.epic.com/about/privacypolicies#mobile-policy-patient","Epic+Systems+Corporation","Medical","MEDICAL","[{""name"":""Medical"",""id"":""MEDICAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YPtBGr6THchfNi4KIo9P4A5TePEia_daTtMtsqwsURjYqngsLCRV1-NUah09z0kcBXs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3jTQxS0b0VLLCCQFoIL13S1DbAFCHAdMH4EhuqYPjYujyJctekzZ-ZaTnJ54Ykuiww","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zCGPUbpMRpCnxt2cG9DebNr6zzmS41zYp7xrEraLNsv2ZjbPtldofsHHGZxvaC-AJZU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lUw17uAsct27DrBelUp5UqDUN3jcO6OCjioubay0QsUSOsRzIX423ogIpJLQ_EFEew"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cA2X5O7bRAQGPtoBmbsnpYVT83LrOMiPvfpQaDNWhHBFvgUfYDteZHEDMGuDlrqUpKk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bXXOx8WaMeFa2BGBnkA1ZwvaRxTIAaE9Ekm2o16i1cS0dY8EHiO65Ds9XkDr6u7yYbA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YOYqFOWLW_KWwnI5r551ELvRQe5R_2VCqh3Gsr699palTM_FwdFp0TtTSZbfJ1P5LCs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IomHUZX94hCx_4SWdOzNzxSJhfRzQiogtpkixelpG8BHr4Yxu7m0_gyWlCYtxcgmkw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LkU9W7nD6t6h6v0IG23yBGv3I0eLAOW-TLeZyq-uDy6hQ7adW3qh9yYG9sMMlaJiZWs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cJiK0kfErDMonrD-BvaRUDPNKVgkOUJwdNyZnkk1i18fShbnFfg1ABlP2chZwsEVOrpH"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hZBopqB9V1f-5f8BS_Z7CIs-qZU0rjPh14yOmNHE6txvmrnRjSN__CVjFP32P-uKU9rt"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ls4VlVACNksxYAnVmHoqoUbxRdDZRF6-PPjj99D9sLq2nSbXeW2DEEbbPoqNiwmSIMc""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Oct 31, 2011",1712351059000,"10.8.5","First-time app setup and organization management have had a modern refresh.

Keeps saying ""check your internet connection."" My internet connection is fine..... | The Office alone makes Peacock great, but then they add so much more. Get Peacock!! | Good show choices s but the app sucks. It keeps freezing up, usually during the ad and I have to keep refreshing the screen. This only happens when I'm using Peacock, no other streaming service. I updated the app, restarted my PC and it still happens. Very annoying. | Having Trouble downloading classic Raw& smackdown episodes | For some reason if you click back too many times the circle just continues on and you have to close the app. | i hate the app layout | love you....thank you for bringing M3GAN back!!!!!!!! | I can not watch movies on the mobile app. Says check internet connection. No issues there. Click on TV icon and I can see all channels. Not sure why I can't select the movie option. | ads? for premium. did used to be that way | we need more novelas and content from Telemundo Thank you Guys 😀 | This app keeps crashing. I'll be in the middle of my show, and it stops playing. | I like that it's not expensive although previews can be annoying but oh well we get it | awesome | if I am paying for streaming. I should not be forced to watch ads | Doesnt work on my android fone evev though its istalled. Says to check internet connection even though im connected. Useless!!!!!! | I haven't been able to the app. I click on it and directs me back to my home screen very frustrating. I just paid for premium yesterday😒 | Plays at 480i SD, instead of 1080 wide-screen HD. Jagged edges, looks horrible | no issues with the application. works great on tv or app | I don't like the commercials | App straight up just won't work anymore and says it requires an Internet connection even when the connection is shown as excellent. Also the app on PlayStation will close itself when trying to watch certain things. | Can't join a live EPL game from the beginning. Takes hours for replays to become available. App needs a lot of tweeks to be good. When a game is finally available to watch it won't play half the time. 1/19/22 Not playing EPL. (AGAin) 8-6-2022 Thanks you for adding the ability to rewind a game in progress. (The option to start it from the beginning would be 😃) Is there a reason replays are not available till the next day? 4/2024 update. This app is a joke. They need to hire some people. | GREAT | Had peacock for years now and up till now i haven't been having any problems until recently it keeps stopping crashing, i have uninstalled reinstalled it more then once still doing the samething It will play sound but it won't show a picture then it will cut off i keep getting a message saying app keeps stopping, and when i go to look at something else it does the exact same thing | Love no commercials | I have been having audio issues for several weeks. You chat through text and can't speak to a real person. It is so annoying. Every time I reach out, I'm not going to unplug my TV, reinstall the app, restart my modem, clear my cache, etc. No, fix it all my other app work fine. | Zzu | I Love it | If it's not choppy video or sync issues, it's commercials randomly playing in the middle of a Premier League match. Can't believe this is what our option is in 2024. Can't believe we have to pay for this. | the streaming on TV ( I have a Samsung TV) it's not making a good connection. it makes the same slow reading as Xfinity Stream App. | Streamer beware! This is the first streaming service that I have had to contact my local district attorney to help me with a refund. Peacock has been charging me double for 3 months, contacted the via email, and they kept putting me in a circle with no resolution. I wouldn't give this company any financial info at all! | Been hacked fir 5 months. Cannot create an account | Please have a REMOVE THIS from watching area. It's highly confusing to know where or what you left off with when watched things can never be cleaned up. | Need a way to delete from continue watching!!! I absolutely hate how I cannot remove a show or movie from continue watching, especially when it's a show that just started auto playing. There are so many posts and discussions online about this so I'm not the only one. You can do this on every other streaming platform I've used. | It doesnt continue series from latest to oldest for shows like Seth Meyers | I have this on all my tvs at home but The app on my phone won't work. I have tried uninstalling it and redownloading thinking maybe it was a glitch. Still the same thing every time I try to watch it, it just keeps loading until it goes to a screen saying I need internet connection. Not only do I have 5G on my phone I am also on Wi-Fi. I'm not home a lot so at this point if I can't watch it on my phone I'm not sure it's worth keeping as a streaming service. | I love it | good tea, nice house | Super glitchy, terrible interface. Won't let you remove shows from currently watching, which the App adds by auto playing a new show if you fall asleep. Shows you are in the process of watching do not sync across devices. Audio falls out of sync. Currently, Phone App not working at all because it times out, even after trying their suggestions. | Since the most recent update this app has not worked at all. Uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared my cache, Internet connection is fine. Hopefully the issue can be fixed | it's so slow, so unresponsive, it's unusable | it's pretty awesome! my favorite site to use | I need it | Downloading a movie is horrible, the app will be downloading at first at a rapid pace, then it will grind to a halt, leaving you in limbo with no sign whether or not your movie is actually downloaded, I was able to finish a movie faster than the sequel downloaded. The only upside is that movies actually, when streamed. Still can't answer for downloading a movie if it'll play. | awesome shows | As good tv shows movies | Trying to watch Raw app either shuts down or restarts. Episodes don't even start | love it 😀 | it won't play for some reason | They app stopped working this morning already uninstalled and reinstalled it so don't suggest that. Also love the lack of customer support 😁 | Streaming seems to never work, I got it to work once but after that it doesnt matter if I'm on 5G or fiberoptic wifi it always says no internet connection, I have a Samsung and so does my husband our peacock app never allows us to stream but I can watch live TV... Deleted the app. It's useless at the moment. | I love you and all you do In Jesus might name | I like Peacock would have given 5 stars but first of all it was free streaming. Last year the company charged me 2.99 each month for one year. Now it went up to 5.99 a month. Probably not a big deal for some fans of Peacock. I will no longer be a Peacock subscriber. I'm moving on to something new. | I can't get on my account to update any of my info so I can get back on my account to do anything | App doesn't work. Keep getting ""Please try again and check you Internet connection"" but my Philo appreciate works fine. Grade = F. Still get the same error. App is fake. | I paid for this over and over and still can't watch on my tv. this app is horrible | Claims of live sports are 99% false. Only games of zero importance played by clubs of no pedigree are shown. Any game worth watching isn't on here until the next day. All around waste of money unless you're using it for bravo | I love peacock | love the shows great app | movie selection is average at best | Worst streaming app ever. Does not matter where you stream, roku, fire stick, Playstation, Xbox, PC (abysmal here), it awful with freezing! Especially live shows. Negative -5 stars Before their dev responds with, ""Have you tried..."" YES I've tried it all. It. Is. Your. App! Edit: Dev responds with contact us here... I HAVE! They made me do days of work on my end trouble shooting. The outcome? They just stopped responding. They did 0% of anything to resolve the problem. Pitiful ""Channels"" streams | while I don't really care for most of the stuff on here,I really love wrestling,so as long as it stays here,I will always be a customer,thank u | The best!! | sometimes it glitches out and doesn't play but very seldom. good enough for me | Good shows and early access to new movies impressed | love peacock | Why so many Spanish commercials? Stupid! Speak English! Too many woke shows obsessed with diversity. Who cares. 🙄 | The app is incredibly glitchy and freezes my phone. | everything bravo I could ever want. doesn't glitch like paramount. few commercials | good enough for what it is, but the controls are better on your phone than the TV. | so unstable","{""1"":35143,""2"":8099,""3"":13672,""4"":38080,""5"":320865}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$5.99 - $119.99 per item","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Peacock TV LLC","Peacock+TV+LLC","support@help.peacocktv.com","https://www.peacocktv.com","30 Rockefeller Plz

I love it! | I was kicked off ebay because, and I quote ""My pricing on an item, was to high compared to similar items."" No warning no explanation. Didn't seem fair. Esspecially with a vey rare and collectible book. | Uncomfortable seller | I've never had any problems with this app. Always worked great | Fantaboulous | Excellent, very easy to use, highly recommended, never had any problems! | eBay give you a false sense of security by letting you pay vat but not enforcing the seller to properly prepare the package so that the receiver doesn't have to pay vat + processing fees on top of that. | Always reliable | Mason Houston ebay package 📦 app installing... fix it | Good experience liking the app | Good quality | Nice | So far everything looks amazing but I don't know if I have a chance of my lifestyle or anything else but I can do it for a while but I know you're a little busy right now | Better than Amazon | Following some issues now great | Since the last update I can not see the items I have sold!!! All I get is an error message, sort this out please | The search engine on this app has sadly gone the way of etsy, the results - no matter how specific and regardless of selected filters - are full of irrelevant garbage and unrelated sponsored listings. I used to be able to search a term or phrase and the results would always very reliably give more or less what I was looking for, that is no longer the case and it makes the app very frustrating to use - to the point now where I might as well just uninstall and delete my decade old account with it. | AWESOME! | Easy to use | Good | They always have what I need | Kya Ebay Pakiatan mn bhi hai ? | Greet | So far easy to use | I've been trying to update this app won't let me fix this now eBay | Works great. | apparently, you can't cancel orders anymore. accidently had something in my cart and placed an order. tried canceling right away. ebay said wait till payment clears then you can cancel. waited an hr for payment to clear, and it said too late to cancel. | Awesome app 👌 👏 👍 | I love buying on eBay!! A really good deals and saves me a lot of money | Not bad. Good performance. Search could be better, and item display on tablet doesn't need to be condensed. | Great app for buying stuff!!!!!! | Awesome | always appreciate this app for finding old vintage/retro games. such a great app to build my retro library. | love it... great prices for all things new and used! | Easy to navigate and found everything i needed | The eBay shop is great and getting better all the time and as the range of products and prices.yeah eBay yeah. "" Shop,shop ,shop ,shop ,shop,,, "",,, legal terms and conditions apply | Wickedly good 👍 👌 | Hey ebay I can't cancel any order request please do something | Always there when I need something | Nice | Very efficient | I like it so far and hoping that my item will be shipped around that date. | Always AWESOME like it alot. | I've been using eBay for 16 years but with each update, I feel less inclined to continue. The app has become pretty much unusable as a seller. I can no longer view sold items (java.io.ioexception) as a consequence can no longer purchase and print postage labels) and the option to mark items as collected now completely disappeared, so items still showing as needing to be dispatched. No one from ebay seems to be able to give me answers either. Think I'll be closing my account now. | Very easy to sell on eBay. | I'm always able to get my money back if something goes wrong | They are horrible, i hope corporate is reading this, Sellers/ buyers beware of this buyer (rbarto3004).shzie_64. jeay9488. crysny-99. Trouble maker! EBay is a joke they allow false feedback people make and deny your report. Allows returns and refunds on a no return/refund policy that the buyer has in the listing! This eBay is a joke! EBay is a scam! They care more about these sellers who try to ruin people. Ebay allows poop to be advertised on Ebay | The search is way better than even a year ago! | Very good UI changes over the last couple of years like having filter pop up at the bottom of the screen, on scroll👍🏾 | Good service.. great buyer protection... | It's the best I have ever seen | The app works very well. Gives access to all the eBay functionality, and all in a very easy to use format. | eBay really needs to improve to get a way in contact with customer service. And really needs to start taking sellers' sides because a lot of customers take advantage of returning items and making false claims. | Decent buying and selling experiences. I hope they keep improving and innovating their app and website. | Great app easy to use great site can always find what I need. | Good items in good condition for good prices | Makes life easier | Great app, works wonderfully! Easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for! I recommend it to everyone I know. | Needs to speed up delivery | Ordering things from eBay is fairly easy, and getting a refund isn't a problem. I highly recommend eBay for anyone shopping online. 👍🙂 | very annoying with trying to draw you in to spend money with voucher codes I've had 3 in the past 2 days | They have almost what I'm looking for | good | Cool app | Good | On time or early delivery good product great price I'm a happy customer | Worst customer service experience ... after 8 years and spending thousands of dollars i am fed up and decided to move away from this app | Great app very happy | good | I'm experiencing beautiful shopping. I just love it. | I like buying stuff that's good quality cheap | I was banned for no reason and they say it's permanent. I was charged and my bank accepted and payed them for the orders that they say were canceled but I payed them and they were delivered months ago. I haven't used the app for months. I just woke up and I got three emails saying old orders were canceled at the exact same time and then 2 minutes later that I was permanently suspended. The help desk said it's not repealable but I didn't do anything. Fix this now | Bid 5 on ps4 won | Show cars in my garage ive never owned & keepa removing the car i do have | I used the filter to show only new items and I ended up buying an open box item. | Amazing experience. Great merchants, and great customer service!! | Always the cheapest prices and always fits my vehicles. | Muy bueno gracias | I used to use a variety of different app to buy all my stuff but I don't know what's happened but the quality of they're seller's is second to none & the deals & savings it a no brainer & if you have a problem it's dealt with swiftly so so much so I do all my shopping for my stuff & they are constantly improving & asking if there is anything you think we could do to make it better & I just say just keep doing what your doing & some how they find something to improve your experience 👌🏼5⭐ | I go for eBay over Amazon any day amazing buying and or selling experience | It's a good stuff...No Diddy | Easy to use | Always enjoy search ebay for quality products at exceptional prices. | Many things can be bought or sold here | Easy to use, find particular items, and keep a watch on things. | I have had multiple bad interactions lately here's one where they claimed to not receive a rare American Racing 13"" wide wheel. They thought they were buying 3 for $200 and I suppose got upset when they received one wheel and lied about receiving it now I'm out a rare wheel and $80 for dismounting and shipping. I would really like my $200 please this is crazy Elon your customer service wanted me to buy a gift card for a refund? I can't even afford a $200 gift card why is this happening. Appealed | Love it | Good | Always good | It's ok | This is a great app | Do you have any use for this platform? I have a use for the company and I have been working on the platform. | Ebay is very responsive and will make sure you get what you bought | Great 😃 | Nice ! | I haven't shopped on this app for a while | Superb. Love it. | The app works great and I love it as I use eBay all the time. | eBay is great","{""1"":162826,""2"":35894,""3"":83437,""4"":473618,""5"":3989439}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","eBay Mobile","6005619443614255030","androidhelp@ebay.com","http://www.ebay.com",,"https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260","6005619443614255030","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/31-mJUIynIfQBizOn-w1yWLKHBxVeRKA3gz348_E3K-TnuEaqCjn_-Fr9j0yQ6i0y5E","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NfY591GkVj31CJRZ2oLgPOldzcxJcPREmdwJ_i5ioZBa2E3FC3iMHKGZ6Yzmhm-_Alw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7WxiKcs24NuO0t_MobHMRjqsBd8FAGyVMnzTi3kQfdHiGTgcsflbZfDcM9RqoD3gRNnG"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ysqavH_KZhjc41kO4y-jxdEMY-TDQVeyot4XyapPbRQenB5Tsk_TeC3U4I-_Ji5hE2jt"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KNoM9PlpDEhm3quHQl2vIagj57VJiH6uf_VL2VZjI8DtXhiswuaOTzRHFEpADLdsig"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SPkW9u4RO6hIa_6ffuURi8m2l5kByG6ARcXfgSUmeyOT7IV0bFqCs0EqlpKt-7cIOjA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YI-smKVVGbzt8xuZ77gKDCPEOhJUnDus6k8WZvql-HdqSnwkjT8h2wvCadPp8FNP1Lc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/01rEpurAy_jbSQZTnlahPaydUIgcGIJDR9AqNh7WMieF2uCZJqgw_Utc3eZEk0wgyT8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FxoBwljErcicw4ox10tcoU2-FAunIp8zZpdqPY1v6tqB0W3U5OIWNizu9Mhv0jqD0BE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SlnZ2yi8ruuhYAgvjxaFtuAXx66gT9HNHZNERqrN2EoUFpzsTv3tvmuS8agtBLcIyV4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-F2FxPnnmv07YufxOt3MUlQquUlqqGubz4n08WuMoom4ix5io25_hSmHwthf1Jk7lA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7U6nZGh3I7EiofIeupGsxqsd8z4Q2GiOpdknSa5uRPLtsPIWjZZxHpF7j9SJ-YfF86E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q1z43QptTZI5_Q_-IezkyR9OzsOjnqCGZ_txASNube7M3Cxy4pIhIGlBdGLBdJFLCbYd"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6sK50bipOiZcL_qpsypn2BzOElQQW1J8efLbYBXsYQHCPs8rM76_Jaexa5YKGmCFd7I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5By4bI9jdVltiKIbvd2ff3Lksa2zsJCehDHZj7EdyH5Q35kbuWbKz_Zcv2JnKrqo_d0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/p11GnZGhCqBYou1d_uHdmmy7uEYfk-WGTGoqLsjeg0bsVRBijiHhzGJc286GuaF2Q1M"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/l08BwEimqpHMfawKJkvgWJyaG1L5Eghq7iTSbEAp9mIWrWrZ4ZoCAMUy-JkUFJ7AmRRT"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/582r7V1yJ_zcjwgkiNE3RVupkYu7acLJ0jnjcCp_mgZcg_3ELSpK1DhrvRbjVX3p4Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/No3vYl-XyDg5pkFc6BUey60idJoqJ2galzo1-21WHBY0gROxKEcvhb-PE3zIx6Cbpw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9Mlxk3cbprojCMzm9sbgY9X8MVzcopfgt2BJdfayHhl_3xyARIiQbOLmNSOdkUvkwFIJ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/acsatRbmWOB3j57JQbtNr7oVfvEt21U5bEsNM9bEEHtkyDK4X33kzAcQWlFFO-khgOPO"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/btlm8vOjZBg8xHZTJhMvKJ6mQQRMmWSWbrDFe-eawqEV3rz_nKMq4c721c5LTs-TqMXE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DYrOeLhKEDlnuZ8hh8HCB10Dsm-iPq6u9q_ZdC3WwmYqCMuil695pTG9NjwWy0YwwNmD"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NxDTfcMTOM3AOjaQGkEvAB_xp3upK8wxHZVmNMOAd-dYjOxRvzvbXOvho_e1By2bWKE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iPM32s5ZzkW9FrklLTvnW_uBuAYYpVudU_j7WI-Ba3ZqrLo9Kjp68AGiRDUiOkAYwheC"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aLEPO0QcK7JMRc2CCXiOVaXK5IQp1DWJ9MleyOBS9hi2l80bb3UIJPDwYso1lOv51w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vltnf9S4WEI3pF7HOZYo-ZtPHGoZ0CLvkzB_RUKnJSXii6lAnquH751M0OFXpSfXETw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fEUncBqTEoOX1RZV2b6DaW_vfVsZmueON0HNXYfE8ERowM-jd-4YYLz9LnEvUyadiA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pm8gzQC5U6twxgskNd5jVTclpdrNZ6o4CvwZbljorlp4-Ns9UDnWKMWJZOmnopAHZk3O"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ziMAxI5CfbK-Kqjvf38MTpn-B5rqi49_7TaICDImJ_Lm1DruPADZP3aaZyF6BoWRkQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qU9lKvS6_QkYyS4bFxGsZohNpsdybnpl269ciSVpse8tCfmKVIkFqsCYnE3GlP1nFw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U6KqdEi_EjKx1o0cs-TPqVBxgSo9hsSpsRvO3g93MLJiHLXNvDF6A5xngXoYYo0FHQ4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5USzjAQzm7BYVK5tsUMgWxlrGtPIJkcXCr8z-_FTbDCK-kSJEziFm3eUcZMPjTI9x7w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qFyR_OlmFU0QYLs4PZrdTl5143A--kyaMsvy0oSQGJpFVjAvvF_gRjh0MMkLUYpbjGw""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBtbd27CYCM?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NfY591GkVj31CJRZ2oLgPOldzcxJcPREmdwJ_i5ioZBa2E3FC3iMHKGZ6Yzmhm-_Alw",,"Teen","Diverse Content: Discretion Advised",true,"Feb 17, 2010",1714150550000,"VARY","Hello eBay customers - please update your app now to make the most of your eBay experience, enjoy the latest features and more!","[null]",false,false,false,"com.ebay.mobile","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebay.mobile&hl=en&gl=US"

Remember how they won't pay livable wages. They certainly had tons of cash to thow at IOF soldiers with free stuff. Starbucks needs to be brought DOWN | Will gladly give four or five stars IF EVER the following get addressed: either add an option in the ORDER section that would give the ability to request their drink be STIRRED, or that you give the option to add a NOTE to put 10-15 words for special instructions. I originally requested this 5 years ago...(no action, nor response). Thanks - | It's good but they need to add a schedule feature so you can say I want it at a specific time on said date. And a cancelation refund feature for Mobil orders. I didn't know it didn't let me do that cause nearly every other food app let's you. Other than that it's a good app too. | App needs settings to create defaults for user. App should allow ""drive thru / in store"" selection before placing order or give option to change after order placed. | 🍉🍉🍉 | Stop funding genocideee yayaaaa | depends on which location you go to!! 😂🤑 | Crashes. Doesn't give credit for items purchased on offers. Customer service is argumentative when you ask them to fix the error. | The app is functional enough, but app does not support multiple forms of payment. So for example if I have a gift card with 3.50 attached to my account And I want to purchase a drink that's 3.55 I have to use a different card or reload and the cheapest option for reloading a card is $10 which I do not want to do. There is absolutely no reason that the system should disallow me from using mostly the gift card and then charge just those last few cents to my card other than greed | Subway makes FANTASTIC subs, but the app sucks....a lot. I feel rage everytime I use it. It's painful to navigate, it's SO SLOW, and it doesn't show all the nearby Subways. PLEASE FIX THIS APP! | good | System error has occurred.. happening way to much lately. Again app keeps shutting off!! Come on Starbucks... I've uninstalled/installed 4x now, signed in/out... AND STILL NOT WORKING! It started acting up AFTER the update. Also, my phone is not old, so that's not a factor either.

Have to re-enter my password before every order now. It used to work better latest update ruining experience. Update: Lowering my rating because I can no longer place orders with recent update. I may uninstall soon. | This app sucks. It forces you to remember s password that isn't NIST conformant. Which means that you can't ever remember it. Which means you need a password reset every time.

I had to report a woman For letting her mid smoke a tobacco Vape. | bad | They support genocide | I haven't even able to log into the app for over a month now. I couldn't even use my birthday rewardast month because of this!! I keep getting we're sorry but we're unable to log you in.Please try again. I've done everything I can think off including uninstalling the app and reinstalledit.Yet if I go on the website which I was only able to go recently, I can sign in with bo problem but no the app. It's very inconvenient!! I'm missing out on so many challenges to earn stars.Extremely frustrating! | So I've only bought Starbucks a handful of times in the 15 years I've had this ONE gift card. I linked it to the app and have used it since then only twice on the app. Well, today, I was emailed by Starbucks that two purchases had been made from my account for two $25 gift cards. Let me tell you, I didn't buy those gift cards. I am really disappointed that Starbucks, a multi-billion dollar business, wasn't able to protect my personal information. I won't be purchasing from Starbucks again. | Same log in issue everyone else is having for the past month. ""We're sorry, but we were unable to log you in. Please try again."" I can login via the website, but not the mobile app. It's not the password. Multiple emails, calls and screenshots of other people having the exact same problem and customer service acts oblivious and gives you the round around. | They made the points worth less and opportunities less frequent. Also there are hardly any opportunities for bonus stars that don't involve over 35 grams of sugar. You'd be better off just getting coffee somewhere else. | Need to have text sms marketing coupons and offers, not just app | Great Java! | Uninstalling the app because of the Supreme Court case where Starbucks is trying to stop labor unions forming at their stores. I will not be purchasing anything from Starbucks until every store that wants to unionize has unionized | Starbucks really needs to add to the app the ACTUAL hours that the lobby/cafe is open to walk-ins. I just walked a mile from my convention hotel to get an early coffee from a store that claimed to be open on the app. However, there was a paper sign on the door saying the lobby was only open later this morning... Should I just walk the drive thru maybe? Or if the app was accurate I would have waited instead of being a salty customer. | Today is the second day there is a reward that it will only allow me to add to the calendar, but is supposed to be active today and doesn't have the activate button. I have tried uninstalling the app and logging out and back in. Pretty disappointed to miss the stars this past Saturday and now triple stars today and the stores have no input how to address the issue either. | Worst app experience! Very bad app. | It's easy to forget to scan at checkout. I have lost so many points because of that. Not sure if I'm the only customer fogetting it, is it by design, or is there room for improvement. ☹️ | Order ahead is not working. The app can't locate any stores. I have restarted the app, double checked the settings, and restarted my phone, nothing is helping. | It really sucks if you forget your phone and can't scan for points or if they didn't ask you to scan. But it's nice for fast orders if you order ahead. | Very Great Way To Pay Or Use When Your In A Hurry, Love The App. Great Coffee And Wonderful Service. Thank You For Everything!!! | I am in the Starbucks trying some foods today. I'm trying the sourdough grilled cheese, lime SIETE chips and a chocolate chip brownie. I also tried a coffee with chocolate pumped into it and yum!!! Stop by and say hi to the staff and Morgan today!!! | App signed me out and won't let me sign in since early this month. Cleared cache & data, uninstalled/reinstalled. Did not work. Called CS, got referral to next level tech (Genesis) who emailed me with instructions & req 4 screenshot to confirm. Did all but NC. Tried screenshot, app would not permit so got screenshot of refusal & sent 2 Genesis with update. That was on 4/12. Radio silence since then. Service fail along with app fail. | Love my tea | I believe everyone loves Starbucks and what a great way to order ahead | I Mercy site I said she's tight, so much like a pipe tickle tickle! She's so tight it will make the balloon pop over her head exclamation point don't blow up a balloon because stop the radio | Friendly 😄 staff and great 😃 tasting coffee ☕ and comfortable seating all add up to an enjoyable experience ! 😁 | It's getting too rich for me | No way to cancel order. I was expecting a confirmation screen before the order finalized, or a way to cancel within x number of seconds. | It Won't Let Me Login In Only Fans 🇺🇸🌊😭 | 💯 | Great app, but doesn't show all stores. There is a large Starbucks right in front of me. It has been there over a year but it doesn't show up on the app so I can't order from here. Other than that, great app. | I can't even get past the sign up. I looked for Starbucks Canada and was given two options to download. Neither would let me change my country to Canada, in fact, you can't even select a country other than the US. Since you can't properly complete the profile as a Canadian you can't benefit from adding your birthday, it won't save, you can only discard everything you've entered. Disappointing and frustrating. | I love this app and it is easy to use | I Starbucks is better than Dunkin Donuts | Stopped providing stars, registering challenge accomplishment. The app can be used to pay, but no stars are granted, purchases meeting challenges are not recorded, no double stars for registered card, no single stars for purchase. No point to app anymore. Customer Service requires receipt-which the app is not properly recording. Get paper receipt & plan call customer service after every purchase if you want your stars. Edit: Stopped working between 10 Apr & 17 Apr purchases. Reinstalled twice. | Thank you Starbucks for a very pleasant experience. Always very clean, very courteous and attentive staff, and all selections are superb. | Convenient | Good waitress, and I enjoy the free coffee. | Should let us rate our drinks. Some drinks at certain locations are better than others. Would be beneficial for both parties to rate our drinks after our mobile order | No option to cancel or even set mobile order pick up time? | I use to love this app I go to the same store every morning and since the 13th of April i have not received any stars I have attempted to reach out but no help very upset how a good thing was ruined :( | Awesome | Would not work in airport. Right beside the coffee shop. ""Unable to order online, barista will take your order"" | Birthday drink has not worked 2 years in a row. Need to call but its only good on my b-day & they are closed. Free SCAM?? They couldn't take the other coupon in my app either so we drove away without collecting or paying for the other 4 drinks and the one that should have been free. It's the principle not the money because we just spent $$$ on dinner and I wanted my birthday coffee! I want my money back from the app because I don't want to keep giving you money!! You don't give me anything! | I'm unable to log into my account and unable to delete it without calling and waiting on hold for customer service. | this app its completly useless in Puerto Rico. here we see another example of racism/discrimination for absolutely no reason. starbucks here its the same as in the states... why cant we order online then??? RACIST | Wow. Wonderful | Love the app, but recently there's not a place to leave tips. It just disappeared. It sucks because I rarely carry cash to leave tips at the store. | Constantly unable to log into my account using the app, more trouble than its worth. | Always makes my drink exactly the way I like it. I had the Starbucks app. Starbucks coffee are overpriced. So I enjoyed Starbucks coffee once a month | Yummy food | Safeway Starbucks didn't know if a drink was good or not and then couldn't even scan my app for points and says I can't get a receipt because it already went thru | Lowkey sucks | Appreciate the new updates with the app and the keeping up with the new releases, all in all user friendly. | Always good! | Can't pay without reloading a dumb gift card. | Leaving one star because their recent price increase has become too much. Until then, I'll be finding a different place to buy drinks. | App no longer works. I have to use the website. | login is broken, 2FA messages are never sent | Missing stars and bariatas not honoring what I ordered and how. Trying to contact support is a nightmare of popup windows on my phone. Trash, just like their burnt coffee | fav app | Really good app. They give you promotions and other stuff you can order so you don't have to wait in line. They give you points and amazing Offers | B2c o ,"""" o 2 | 1 a1 1hq | My only problem is that I can't seem to open the app from the widget. Otherwise it's super useful and easy to use. Has definitely improved from what it used to be. | You did it, ladies. You filled Kinnick Stadium and road arenas. You set more records than we can count. You united a country when almost nothing does. You attracted fans from 3 to 103 and made Hawkeye fans out of Cyclones. You proved superstars can pass and younger players can rise to the occasion. Most importantly, you did it all while proving stars can be role models worth lifting up. Sure, we’ll remember your results.h But we’ll remember YOU even more. Thank you for the joy. Thank you or what | Starbucks is way too expensive now and a tip option? Remove it and Pay your employees appropriately don't expect the customer to do that. | Couldn't login into the app, and I had to make a new account with the same email account. Lost out on some credit I had. The app kept saying username or password is incorrect even after with the new account. | Terrible App Design! I placed an order like I always do through the app and my dad went to pick up the drinks, and the store never received the order, I sent my dad the screenshot of the receipt because they didn't want to give him the drinks, and the RECEIPT doesn't say the ""DATE"" anywhere! So they couldn't give me my drinks because it only say the word ""TODAY"" so the store manager doesn't know if is and old image of the receipt or what to believe! That's a mayor flaw in the Receipt Design. | 🍉🍉🍉🍉 | Garbage app won't login. All login info verified and working online.

When you click on the link to verify your account all it does is take you to an error link that says the link is expired. Therefore you can't verify your account. | Good | can get codes is bunk but OK otherwise | Really nice two beable to make a call when you can't afford service.thank you. | Terrible. Not what it was years ago | awesome 💯😎 | good connection | 😃 | It's convenient while my regular phone is broken | Rating 3 out of 5 for following reason... The app is Excellent,but the emails saying, ""Make a call,bla,bla bla"" are soooo annoying! I USE my phone all the time!! I SEND TEXTS (sometimes with pictures ) I RECEIVE CALLS and I MAKE CALLS! Really thankful for the free service,but... SUGGESTIONS: Check client records BEFORE sending out those annoying messages. Thanks for otherwise a very good free service. | Love calls to make | If you buy a subscription, have patience. It takes a few hours before you can receive text verification or call verification. Wait 24 hours at the most. Everything should work fine. Their customer support is also pretty good and responsive. | Nothing about it is ""FREE"" | great | Ive enjoyed the app and had no problem with it. | I love it but sometimes I don't love it | the best app | I've only had it for a week but it seems to work pretty well | AMAZING! THANKS | I cannot download roblox my favorite game | Too many pop-up ads block my access before I can use the device | It's REALLY weird, bc I have SOME of my apps, like I have play store, but not apps I downloaded, FROM playstore, not others, Can't get on ""X"" or Pintrest, I have some of my TEXTS, not others, and I CAN'T call anybody!! | Doesn't let you make free wifi calls that exceed 1 minute. Ininstall | Easy set up and works well! | Good | I Love it! | Great | Scam you have to pay to be able to receive calls if you lock yourself out of Gmail or Bank any Bank verification code you have to pay monthly fees | Idk can't down load it | good wifi calling if u r broke and can't get service anywhere else | Couldn't call no one | Did it's job 😮‍💨 | I love this app | great | Trash. I can't use it to see verification codes from websites on the free version? Why, that's such a stupid concept. Uninstalling. | Support me , | Great | not so bad | very helpful I love it | On a low budget an I thank text free call free, for all there doing to keep people connected. | Have to pay to get verification codes | Love my wifi | Good | TextFree costs $10 to view texts you receive. This is not free. | New ""Upgrade"" SUCKS! I had given this app a 4 Star review a few years back. Now lowering it to 2 Stars. This app worked great for years, then they ""Upgraded"". Now you can't ""Copy & Paste"" anything, you have to Upload a pic, Download it into a saved file, then download into the text message. Something that took 5 seconds now takes minutes. Contacted the ""Help"" desk and have received 2 different answers. 1)This issue will be fixed-Don't know when. 2) Feature is no longer available on this app :-( | 0pposed for a long time bc ppl used my phone number to get the perks I presumed so my regular number always got affected as well as my email addresses. Fortunately this time, seeing my good friend is letting me use his extra phone, it has been a life saver literally. | I don't have a problem with the app. I live in the woods and I have a tin roof and the Wi-Fi and even the data is hard to pick up. I wouldn't hesitate to tell anyone about it👍 | I love it | So far so good, I'm enjoying this free service, it's nice to have a 2nd number to use on websites also it will come in handy if you misplace your cellphone just take an old cellphone or tablet with your new textfree number & keep calling your phone until you find it. The sound quality is good. | Trash calls and they charge you for some texts yea dont waist your time not free at all worse than every other free text app by far 0 out of 5 stars | Good | great second number | This stupid app keeps changing the phone number within minutes | I'm just getting started so far so good,but I'm trying to make it My default app,let you know more tomorrow | Horrible! Evfrytime I tried to text it failed staying I needed to obtain a new number! Waist of my time! You just wanna steal our contacts I'm not stupid. Market the honest way! | Very good service. 👍🏾 | Used to work good now it's saying that my account is not created when I try to log back in | Only using the text feature with images between Android devices, that works very well. | I love being able to talk to my kids and my Grandbaby! I appreciate TextFree like no other! ❤️❤️❤️ | Need to make a call and cant ? | I can't cancel my subscription. TextFree nor Google Account give the 'Cancel subscription' button. I know how the process goes. I chose to deactivate my account until I get this sorted. It seems like my bank card is being held hostage. I can't remove it from Google account until this issue is resolved. This is one of the reasons I avoid subscriptions. TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM! | Just awesome | Finally found an app that works fine as a 2nd number | good app hands down 💪💯 | Does international calls for free! But verfication codes need money | Love It | sometimes the call don't go through for a while | couldn't send or receive texts. Due to inactivity lost number. Every time I try and sign up for new number says I can't use my brand new number due to inactivity. ??? | EC | THIS APP IS TRASH NOW. I CANNOT USE IT BECAUSE IT CLAIMS I DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS WHEN I'M CONNECTED TO MY HOME WIFI. GARBAGE. | Good | Can't use to verify accounts | Have set up yet | would be better if you didn't force me into buying your 10$ plan inorder to receive my text codes🙄 | Useless | great | Doesn't work. Although I'm not surprised. All settings and permissions granted but just doesn't work right, I'm happy I didn't pay anything. Un-installed it, phone is crapped up from meta apps as it is. BYE | Horrible, can barely hear anyone gotta scream just for them to hear you | Works well only downfall is the every once in awhile ads. | I don't get notifications even though all are turned on and the assistance chat bot is no help | Have been using text free for just under a week. The texts work great, so far...but calls are another story. So far, every single call drops at .31 seconds. Have tested this multiple times w/different numbers & always drops at .31 sec & everything I've tried has not fixed the problem incl reaching out to customer service. | Ok | Great | Not having ANY luck with these communication apps. They all have serious issues and glitches, bugs etc. THIS one Text Free is telling me I don't have a working internet connection! I have full bars so no. It's not the internet connection it's the APP! | Good | the best | Sucks I can't even use it | good | it works sometimes and it's slow | thank you | This app is absolutely plagued with add on that self install on your phone, and ads are non-stop. It makes the entire app, USELESS. Of course, they will come back with something like, ""Sorry, it's the only way to keep it free"". But to throw a 30 second ad up after every-single-text? Find something better. | Wonderful to always have this number | it's so different from the actual something but I get used to it | its a great app | I'm not sure what's going on but each time I get a call the other person can't hear me, then I play around with the speaker and whatnot and eventually, with a long delay, the other person starts to hear me but usually hang up before then. Not sure what's going on? Help | Phone doesn't ring when a call comes in. It also doesn't give notifications when a text message comes in. I have sent several emails to customer service but all they do is keep giving the same so called solutions over and over. I have deleted my service. No sense in paying for something you can't use. | not sure yet haven't use this app in a while | Service is not working | Worke great better than other apps I have used | sooper","{""1"":30420,""2"":11251,""3"":39444,""4"":75956,""5"":381299}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.99 - $99.99 per item","8.0","8.0","VARY","Pinger, Inc","4765596083042714620","support@pinger.com","https://www.pinger.com/","97 South 2nd Street, Suite 210

Why would anyone wanna pay for so many subscription services and then pay to use a remote every month too. | Trash | Did not help | thanks for the quick response and service | This is nothing but a scam, go to the official Roku app and you don't have to pay,who ever this is, is riding on rokus name | Worst app ever, it's unusable, every button click opens an advertisement | Still had ads after I paid 25 dollars | I don't understand why adds are popping up? 3 adds just to turn down the tv, and I'm using the paid version. | I paid for it it wouldn't work and now I want to stop being charged for the app | I paid for the life time so I didn't have to deal with the 5 second commercials every 10 seconds and. I still get the commercials. Waste of money. | dint work | Terrible app, completely unusable without a subscription. Pop ups every time you click on the remote. | It's better than the other one's. I've used so far. B | I try to use the remote but a truck add pops up. I shrug it off but the add keeps popping up every 3rd tap. Pls fix this | app is online but roku charges you a monthly fee. | awesome lost remote | Helps when i lose my remote 😅 | It works great! Edited to add that I am removing a star because I feel that if I pay 24.99 for an app, I shouldn't have to deal with ads. | So bad all adds no remote | It would not link to my television | Is NOT free | Didn't work. | easy to use. | Yo much commercials | App doesn't work. | Intrusive Ads get in the way | ads | It's good the only complaint I gave is there isxbibvolume control. | I'm not going to pay | good | The WORST APP because after you pay 20 MFing dollars & still are watching ADS more than being able to use the actual remote!!! | It's amazing 🤩 | I want to cancel my subscription to this app. I'm having no luck at achieving this. I am computer illiterate. | The official app is so much easier. Why would I want to pay a subscription or watch ads when I just need the app when I misplace rhe remote | too many other things pop up. I just wanted the remote | This is the worst experience I have ever had. For l one, they kept asking me to pay for it, and it was glitching. The roku remote app has ads which is aggravating when it keeps popping up , thinking about downloading this.....not a good choice. | great for when your remote control stops working or if you want to listen in private you can use your phone with earplugs | stop the ads!!!! | For an app you pay for, it could be better. Dislike the ads and the reconnecting everytime. | pay monthly for a remote? ridiculous! | EXCEPTIONALLY 420 FRIENDLY. WORKS GREAT | too many ads | Love it! TV at my finger tips! Thank you Roku Remote! | To much ads...at every button press....that's too bad | why should I pay for this | I love that it is working for us in a pinch of not having a remote available, but the ads are way too much. I counted 8 ads that I had to wait for, just to click over to a show I wanted to watch. | If I could go lower I would this app sucks you have to pay when the free one is below it | just bought the TV and 2 days later my dog hid the remote and I purchased a new one but needed to turn on TV to sync remote !!! took less than a minute !!! Good Job !!! | paying for no ads seems ridiculous but so does exiting out of ads every time u press a button is too | Didn't even work right | to many ads | Who thought it was a good idea to have this many adds? They're clearly trying to annoy you into buying the premium version. That and having to reconnect to the TV every time I turn my phone screen off is ridiculous | Why do I have a commercial after pushing a button three times? So annoying | Why is this above the actual Roku app? It doesn't even work, period. | This app is completely useless unless you buy the upgrade. Ads come to frequent to find shows to watch and are longer than the time tv guide stays on. | I downloaded the app today and the number of ads that pop up are ridiculous. I will be uninstalling once I get my remote. We shouldn't have to pay for this service, but I'm guessing since Roku didn't create one, the app creators are taking advantage of an opportunity/ need. | I wish there was a zero rating for the app store cause this 1 would get it | Too many ads | I have a roku 50 inch sharp TV and one day I got.really angry and spiked my controler at the ground so had downloaded this app and it's great only thing is it doesn't turn TV on so I just unplug and plug it back in than it usually pops up a great app I love this app | Fantastic | Too many adds Don't download | cool for extra remote | Horrible ads | I barely try the service I'll see it as good or not | Higly recommend | The ad for this app tricked me into filling out their forms instead of the real app's. My bank instantly sent me a fraud alert. Do not recommend downloading | I paid for this and still have to deal with adds while trying to use this | The real one is free | ads are 👎 | Wouldn't let me turn my TV up or down it only let me mute | It would not stop asking me to subscription | Horrible | Yea I tried them and they said they can't issue the refund it's through u all so someones lying here | So many aids just don'tuse this use the real roku app. Edit after response - bro it's a remote you don't need aids every 3 clicks to support a f ing remote you clown. You know how many ads I had to wach to just log into my damn Hulu. Gtfo of here with this sorry donky of a response. | Nice | You don't need this app. The official Roku app has a free remote you can use without ads every 5 clicks | relentless sub pop ups | Trash app with nothing but ad's | LESS THAN 1 STAR Had to reinstall app and now adds take over, never had this problem with the older version.. APP IS ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!!!@@ | great | so many deceptive ads | No remote what so ever | good | Fake scam | love this app | App sucks, and you get an add every 4 button pushes. Just dumb. Why would any body install this instead of installing the actual Roku app. Just a moronic app and implementation. | Great | adds kill this loud and obnoxious have used better virtual remotes that don't disconnect at the drop of a hat. | Awesome | Not free | Scam | Ads every 5 clicks. Showing the same ad over and over again doesn't make me want to get the app.. actually makes me not want to get the app. If I company is that annoying before ever downloading the app I can only imagine what it would be like owning it | This app sucks I did the free trial and on the 6th day they charged my card for the amount | Why charge when there's a free app. Scam | so happy this works, the remote stopped working and friends suggested thus app!! | did not work | No good | Unusable","{""1"":8710,""2"":1006,""3"":2974,""4"":5157,""5"":37504}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $24.99 per item","7.0","7.0","VARY","BoostVision","8977711922169351149","gp.feedback@boostvision.com.cn","https://www.boostvision.tv/app/roku-tv-remote","Room 306, Building 8, No. 1480, North Section of Tianfu Road, Gaoxin, Chengdu, Sichuan","https://www.boostvision.tv/privacy-policy","8977711922169351149","Tools","TOOLS","[{""name"":""Tools"",""id"":""TOOLS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UjbI0jLzkXHjM52UoFJYt2u9xk0gBFa29G44VY1icQI-JoOJQwmI_eE-J17YHAinWdE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DX_zjswHmYLRb44CXxMas052Mj8qep2vfTJCh8-6_syW_lyNInmgMgLtnzjIpFvW9RY","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EtqJnPgIp0sHxXL6kPSGH_9HDdUZJWKhwdPaAzbtAJZXj75iGsCqxMVzEygIpzI55A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5wsxfldvl8BdKyuV0TfsGEkI_CDXZm0t15qrClygqNiv6KLpCvm_6oZ8yRcjSqoqpnA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Lj2vNXUDK48qrEIm1Jt03-0eC8OdxbiDUBvGCGLUE4vdMuFKYOHqN4Tuct1J4zepAqc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pk0osQL7l25vNF64sXFLBU1HiwSSDnVcruDHsz6V-ZmJ_nk8uzpinkjwFKd-0b2MRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pVZILY4ZAaJqyZXpi41Oyhmxkh9bO08SzAmrhsevs1JnMSJHBtTr2Dq15r5f8i8zwiE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eQFqqKbr6yW2oHJ1Zb5KkRO-LInrbyq0SaKLg2OEIfaNiEI0wWZISGZKBvLwvS6_Ybc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WIoTKKg5BhLgnKTLLQ4IFBhc422PROSHn3EtWDj5FphWT4AKwyg66xYITUWW3xA2m4M"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aTT_BlF8qZAl3dd-vDhamTI3XOGZkhhjJDilJYKLU7QG_-2xw713mUR5rJ10Dg_FdcI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/w1eUclMRbJZ1u7Tl3LU39WgbH361SnL8oVXFVeJ1vvEnc4bDPT8KQ3D3baKmPhMTF-E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GeJ7PDd3fyl-xn3gbCvCXMoat3fI7qbjlnfN3FBsCTQkxXxWowsTMK1OBmBAsITeWnU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6W-XePHLgYGVpE_k1tmA7nTkzvJKkOq2H5a4Dw3PNFJs-7EurgzSv8w7AlYde0R0ng"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uwLRZWDHHsgxmmYG9dpK5wR7pJ6lBuSXqY6xYtc_DS1a_puy0qnLscShUQ_4PUdzfbVx"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n9UqhgLyOfs3-WH5yKZhrnXhfjZCSQ7oX8fsxEMbd_mfn_I5Vjcs9acr_nqat6Ad9a4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0j18mGVQd2eV0sVCwBLQJCVZi_ootr6sFKx1O4jLWOkIdm2966ZsELZ_NdAz2vCi8bc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7cR65fIAHnty7Z53JfCBmieqK1CbjxDVoHUYbcJd5PnAVHcodlyiJQadgbKcz2Gsxsh0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pTM5WvU10O8ZNXQrEj4VB7l7jWyxcac7OWvo5yQY2ZzCuyIEazrSNf4Yd2YDUr7xog"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XqDGcgzBJgeVyuuI0pTnHmYSofwserIHa9GqzogUocx60vl3M2-GeDDbhc_e0-tAG2c"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oq5NbNWDwfQZydPAuMGHqXY5jmcFNcO_y629_m0lCw-B04uI2G1XWyxece7ck-02oQ""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/reXrrJGzoKI?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DX_zjswHmYLRb44CXxMas052Mj8qep2vfTJCh8-6_syW_lyNInmgMgLtnzjIpFvW9RY",,"Everyone",,true,"Jun 1, 2022",1713352056000,"1.4.1","Remote control for Roku TV, screen mirroring &amp; cast phone screen to Roku TV with one tap!","[null]",false,false,false,"com.boost.roku.remote","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boost.roku.remote&hl=en&gl=US"

In the meantime, I am moving to an alternative like Jellyfin. | It really helps me alot i did understand probably the instructions wasn't so difficult it feels good to learn more about this app | Way too many ads | No comment | Latest version unusable on Android TV. Constantly need to force stop. Main UI buggy when it does work. | I like the service and movie choices but what's up with your guys commercials? It pauses like 4 times in a 30 second commercial every commercial which makes the 1 hundred and something seconds seem like 10 minutes. | when autoplaying the picture goes out while the audio plays normally when loading next episode, i cannot find a setting to directly link to my server in case of internet outage, playback constantly skips on an ethernet 1 gig connection, on startup initially refuses to connect to server, crashes frequently on my sceptre android tv. if a new version fixes most of these issues i would bump the rating but cannot in good conscience as it is. works great on roku but androidtv version is trash. | Give me an S-T-Y! | good | Good | App cuts video before camera hole and not enlarge it on its true full screen | best streaming app that you have full control of | the message ""unable to play media"" simply anoying | great selection of movies and shows | Besttttttt | It's a constant source of troubles.

Out of all the movie apps out there it's gotta be Plex. | Enjoy the Movies | love watch shows that I love in the past | Pretty good, only used it to brag about only watching monochrome movies and insisting on calling them films. I am the worst type of insufferable | This app keep glitching I only had this about 5 minutes and when I tried to sign in so I clicked google clicked my email and welcome glitches | Please add a proper fullscreen mode, one that draws over the camera punch hole area | Why does some episodes on what I want to watch have German dub over the English I cant see anyway to remove it and then some episodes have no voice at all just normal sound with any voice? | Great app | I love it, it also has way more TV Channels and Movies than Pluto, it has great selections of Movies and TV shows.

Tried everything. Well obviously plex exec's think the problem is mine rather than fix the ad problem. Why do we need 6 ads in a row for such a short movie segment? So here again I'll repeat the issue, the commercial interruptions freezes after 5 of 6 ads play . Fix it. It looks like others are having the same issues. So rather than move the negative reviews to a forum, it will stay here till you correct the problem. | Plex is the only streaming service I use anymore. Being able to cast from my phone to any TV with the app is a game changer. Never change Plex! | very good | Only issue I have is that continue watching doesn't appear anywhere on my home page like it does on all other Plex apps that I use. Very strange, but not enough of an inconvenience to be to affect the rating. As always, I'm very happy with Plex Edit: I've since learned that the continue watching section appears after clicking my watchlist and then returning home afterwards! Even less of a concern now. | Best media enrichment app EVER. Works great on most devices. But the latest version can't play videos on external players, when installed on Amazon Fire tablets. You have to download the super buggy 9.30.0.3604 version to make that function work at all. That's not a long term solution. Plex is aware of the bug; but has no ETA on a fix. Hopefully, it's fixed very soon. In my opinion, the ability to watch videos on external players is an important option. The built-in player lacks many features. | Amazing 😍 | Great movies and TV shows and the extra stuff like showing an actors movies that are on here and the recommendations are also spot on ty😁💞 | Plex asked me to rate it again.. been using plex for several years and my honest opinion is normally it would t be worth spending money on. It struggles with Chrome casting and it buffers a lot even across a local network with 1gbps connections watching a 1080p video. But it's the only app that does what plex does. | off the Chai ne good. | this is a very good app has lots of good movies | app works fine until just about a week or two ago, then it went downhill. any new content just closes the app and reboots it. the interface where the chosen title used to get bigger in order to indicate that it was highlightedno longer does that. it makes it almost impossible to see what is chosen since my posters are outlined and white.I have no issues on my Nvidia Shield but on my Android TV from TCL and my father's TV from Sony this is happening on both of those. | u can't watch any shows | great variety of programming.

You will have to invest high to work using UberEats. It drains so much battery, and in every update the app requires more from the processor. My Samsung S10 is beginning to freeze in live order because of the excess of features. | tq uber | Nice platform | easy to use | Nice | This is the worst company to work for. Representatives lie constantly, treat you like your a robot and repeat themselves reading off a cue card, make promises they don't intend on keeping (constant lies) Representatives have falsified supervisors literally put me on hold for excessive wait times to only pretend to be a supervisor but then hang up on me when I state the obvious lie. They dnt reimburse trips properly or fairly. They claim they dnt have access to your acct yet my acct will sudd | nice | Customer service ur very bad 👎 | Great app | P kmpo p | 😀 | 🛺🛺🛺 | it's a great app to use so far.... | Uber is 100% perfect | ok | super 😊 | good 😊 | 1 It seems uber don't want any advise from any driver but we the drivers we problem and anything u have to stop work and go to the office mean while u can create WhatsApp group for the drivers to share our problems over there 2 we find it difficult to pay your commission instead of minimise the payment u will wait till 50 60 70 before the person can pay Bcos of this some of them are stopping using uber do something about it at lease we can pay from 20 gh going then it make easy for the driver | Thank you | Safe Uber good Uber | My surge map is broken. It doesn't look like the new or the old map on the website. Surge doesn't change the price of trips at all. No customer service or technical support avenue exists to help with this issue. | Very nice person | Good | good | auto ke liye thik hai bs | Whyyyyyyyy, I would deliver in this app more often but the damn chime and the fact you can't turn it off is driving me crazy | Ola best hai | Very best aap I'm very happy with uber driver aap | Garbage app, barely works when it needs to. | It's a very worst app agents are not cooperative and after complaining again and again no one is looking up for my issue. I have uploaded all documents and optional documents also but still my account is not activated I have waited for 4 days and they are giving excuses of BGC approval | I was eligible for the cancelation fee, uber didn't give me fee because I move to long side. The customer requested me to come building opposite roadside and told me to take short cut road near building, but I can't take that road, because that road is made for emergency purposes. So, I used the main road, after I found the customer, she canceled my order. | Don't waste your time. I got deactivated after only being on the app for less than 2 months. Apparently one person lied and said they didn't receive their food with zero proof, which was all it took. When I reached out and asked about my money, they basically told me to kick rocks. BE AWARE: When you sign their contracts make sure to opt out of the arbitration. If you don't and get wrongfully deactivated and they keep your money like me, you can't get a lawyer involved. | Great app | nhi | NICE APP FOR CAB DRIVER. CALLING SUPPORT WAS POOR SUCH AS CALLING CUSTOMER OR UBER SUPPORT. | 😊😊😊😊😊😊 | Very bad after the update . If you are in a trip you can't scroll down the screen to change the navigation app or get the trip turn by turn or even get Ann access to your account or accept a reservation or do anything.

Every time I check for scheduled rides, the app loses network connection. Only solved by rebooting the phone. Issue appears on Note 10+, S22 and S23. | Terrible choice, customers reduce your tip for No Reason...Unfair App..stay away!!DoorDash is Better. | Nice experience | Driver | Is there anyway in future versions of the app we could add the functionality to choose a direction. I live next to a major city...my trips frequently take me into that city. What bothers me is, once I'm in the city, I start getting trips that take me the other direction from where I live. I don't really mind that...What I do mind is at the end of the night...having to drive an hour back while I make no money because the app will either keep me in the area or send me even further away. | Easy going and friendly work time and upperchunity | Aceptance rate only updates the number when you reject a ride, but it takes a bunch of acceptance to update the acceptance rate. That's unfair. That's cheating with your first line force providing Uber money. I've been reporting this issue continuously, but it still remains on the app. | ok | I have been trying to find reasons to appreciate this app, but I am unable to do so. The workers are treated unfairly, almost like slaves, due to the low trip fares. The payment is inadequate and a large percentage is deducted.

Does not remember your address or your closest store location. Have tried doing an order using same arby login, both app and web refuse to save address or store location. Website refuses order more than $100. Even saving account info on website, app will not see it | Terrible app, I made an account and can't log in. Just goes back to the login screen. I have attempted to reach out and heard nothing back. | good food | Good food friendly service low price arby's. Need I say more? Oh wait, they got the meats. | I just love Arby's and the deals offered on their new app. | works good | Very good food and pleasant workers | What a SCAM!!!! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET ONE FREE SANDWICH EVERY WEEK FOR THIS MONTH AND YOU CAN'T BECAUSE ALL YOU GET IS ERRORS !!! Cannot use app! | Wonderful clerks assist me on app! | The Best ! | The best sandwich ever | Won't let me sign in. On 4/26 , I tried again and it wouldn't let me sign in or reset my password. Deleted the app! | much better to order from know that it's not jus credit card thank I so much love tha food here and always get great deals | Doesn't work | Similar to other reviews, the app won't allow me to sign in (I used to be able to use the app successfully in the past). Can't sign in? Then your app is pretty much useless. | always good eats | Can't sign in. Can't sign in on the app or the website. Haven't been able to in weeks. I imagine it's not the app but the app and rewards are useless if I can't sign in. | Deals don't go through, and I get my order minus the deals. | Love the app. Makes ordering food so simple. I love being able to just walk in, grab my food, and leave. | Horrible | It won't let me sign in This app is trash | App logged me out at checkout. | i love Arby's go arbys | amazing food | I love how great the food is every time I go. The staff is well-trained, nice, and talented! | Best beef and cheddar sandwich in recent memory. | why can't I order for drive through pickup in the app? | Taking forever!!! | COMPLETELY USELESS! I was able to create an account, and I received offers for a free sandwich for the month, and I can even create an order, but I am unable to associate a method of payment. I can't even go to the internet and use a browser, as the web version won't even let you click on ""add a card"". This whole app is completely useless. It seems like Arby's just cares about what drives customers to the store, not about what keeps them there. Pretty sad considering Arby's is considered niche. | Delicious! | App will not allow me to sign in. I think this needs addressed asap. | Best food ever | best brisket sandwich I've had from Arby's. | the best is my vote | awesome 💯 | The app is no longer working. I had been using it with no issues and logged out yesterday and now it won't let me log back it. Just stays on the red page where you can either join or sign into the rewards app. I have tried clearing the cache and data for the app as well as the Google Play store app cache and data and uninstalled the Arbys app and reinstalled but still can't get logged in. Arby's online support needs to help. I also tried on my windows PC and get the same issue. Please fix! | sStaff is always friendly. If you the app you can get great deals. Today I purchased a Brisket sandwich (best sandwich around) and got a double beef and cheddar free. $7 value!! | app is very straightforward | Unable to sign in on this app with Google Pro 7 phone. | my first time ordering Arby's App, for the buy one & get one free before the month was over. ordered while in the restaurant food was ready probably in minutes. | it's great rewards this month with free sandwiches available... who doesn't love Arby's | This app would be a lot better if you could use the deals in store and not only on the Internet | Can't use gift cards and has payment errors often. Performs bare minimum require to be considered a functional application | I have not been able to log into my account on the Arby's app for months, and it has had problems for years before that. I love their food but the app is useless and makes me never want to give them my business. What a waste of time. | i love the food here. | Good food, good coupons. | Cant login no matter how I try | lovethe Arby's app | pain in the rear with online ap. Thanks to Michelle supervisor in Lincoln S 48th. Arby's location. | Can't login app just crashes, starting over at signin. Deleting cache and data does not work. | always tasty! | After most recent required update I can't sign on to the app from my Samsung S22 Ultra | best roast beast! | Love this Arby's | The worst app | awesome location | I love there food. the worker who assisted me was very professional.

Great job! /s | Nice App, professional, great discounts | I haven't had my food yet. After I eat, I will review it. | Everyone is so nice and polite. | Doesn't let me sign in.

I'm sure when the free sandwich deal is over, I'll be able to | After downloading app, cannot sign in. | Can not sign up on line. Too difficult!!! | This app is about useless All it does is take up space on your phone. It will not allow you to sign in at all. | Great service. Also very helpful. Thanks. | free sandwich go brrrrr | Will not allow me to create an account. Makes this app pretty useless. GalaxyS22 | App would not allow me to sign in. | well for one thing it's right across the street from my job and not only that it's great food good tasting love the sandwiches | The two places I stopped at you couldn't order online for their deal Ozark Alabama is the third one thought I had it in lake Park Georgia it's a good thing Popeyes was beside it when I get down to zero Stars I just delete the app I'm not trying anymore I'm done deleting uninstalling get off my phone | I also am experiencing the error message ""Something went wrong. Please try again later."" with the app and online ordering. Offering free sandwiches and then not allowing anyone to log in to purchase them. Sounds fishy to me. I like Arby's as a fast food option, but they need to hire someone that knows how to work with tech if they are going to offer deals that require us to place orders through their tech-based ordering options. Using up-to-date Android phone. | Can't sign in using the app on the phone. | Since the promo for the free sandwich only available thru the app, my app will not let me log in. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but still the same thing. It is just an endless loop of going back to the same screen with no log in. It won't even let me sign up for a new account either. Guess no free sandwiches in April for me. | Pickup works fine enough, but delivery is nigh unusable. Deals, for some reason, completely do not function, it's just a spoof of the door dash ui that loads terribly. The point of the app is said deals. Every other fast food app handles this fine. Unacceptable. | Arby's is awesome, app could use some love. logs me out frequently and doesn't load sometimes | Love the food and love Arby's | app acts up sometimes and I can't order | I enjoy the Arby's app & the Tallmadge location has been fresh almost every time I go. Good customer service also. | not fast food just good food | Unable to use, can't sign in. | Can't even sign up or in from app | It will not log me in after creating an account. I haven't been able to get the free weekly sandwich because of it or gain and collect points with orders. Tried everything from uninstalling app to clearing caches on app. So far my experience with this app has been a f'n joke. | Can't even try to log in | If you have to rely on delivery don't bother. They won't let you use any deals or loyalty program. They just pass it off to Doordash. If I wanted to use doordash I'd use doordash. This app is useless. | App sucks. Dont waste your time and patience. Deleting app its a waste of storage . First time ever to comment on ANY app. You can read everyones response. Looks like im not alone. What a way to get dumb asses like me into the store.wont fool me twice!! Id give 0 stars but you cant do that either. | I have the same problem as everyone else cant actually join fix your bs app arby's! | login impossible... Link is broken or something | Lost a star when they dropped their great onion rings. Otherwise great! | 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 | Always a pleasure eating here.. they always know what I'm gonna order when I come. It's like my family away from home. The MGR is the absolute best. >:) | Won't let me sign in | Fast and friendly!!! | i love Arby's | The Arby's I'm trying to order at closes at 10. I want to use the free sandwich deal which is online only. But the app is telling me the restaurant is closed and I can't place an order. They are open for 45 more minutes.

App no allowing to access my account lately. Hope it is just a glitch that has been working on. | Very important, always available, makes life easier. I love it. thanks 😊. | Ok | Update your ATM locations! I just wasted 30 minutes driving to a Massage Envy that's been there for 3 years instead of a Chase. Definitely closing this account since it's no longer convenient. | I need modify deposit check my limit is $2.491.12 I want to change to $3.000 | Easy and so convenient, I love my chase app! | Complete scam they locked me out of my account and refuse to open it back up even though i called the help line looks like i lost all the money i wanted to invest horrible service and customer service support | Easy to use | Easy to use. | Chase Bank sucks ! They're just like clients say about them...racist and discrimatory about customers. | Great app | Always crashes anymore! Fix your problems! | I would rate it 5 stars if it had a dark theme | Need online... | Great bank to bank with | Never have any problems with app. | honestly for what it is,it's great,pay my bill check my credit score, no errors or lag not bad at all | Most HORRIBLE BANK ever!!! I have never seen a more cold hearted HEARTLESS bank such as CHASE BANK , they have nothing in place that protects the customers!! | Why do I have to open the app twice for it to work? This has been an issue for a year or two already. | Not so sure I was in trouble my account was compromised no fault of mine and they closed my account and cut me loose leaving me no way to get my ss money.. needless to say I was thrown to the wolf's rogue Federal was able to dry my tears.and helped me.out..thanj you rogue Federal.. | Good. The cards should all navigate the same. I find Pay and Balance are in different locations on the MasterCard. | I really like online banking with chase It makes it very convenient To track my spending. And it is very convenient to pay my bill | love it | Doesn't get back with you immediately for a password reset!!!! | Easy to use | Not allowing me to log in | It's cool | Locking the debit card is not working consistently. If I unlock the card and logout of the app and then login to the app right away to lock it I can't. I have to force stop the app and then login again and then I can lock it. Also I want to get app notifications when a transaction fails,like if I have the debit card locked and forgot. You're fraudulent activity monitoring is not sufficient. don't like that some transactions are allowed to go through despite having the card locked. Too risky | Does what I need it to perfectly. | Awesome, easy to use | The app makes paying your bills easy and doing the updates to the app easier. | Great app | I got a pre-approved invitation letter. I applied it and was approved. But, the credit card was not delivered, instead my account was closed without letting me know any information. When I asked them, they told me to reapply it, but not approved anymore. Too bad. | Had where app would not allow me into my account for a time. Where I was told by Chase to delete the app and re do a new app. Has happen twice to me. Also told by Chase others had the same problem. | Very user friendly | The best emergency, transactions, etc,etc,etc. | I love it | This ap is awesome | A must for small businesses owners | It's not letting me pay my credit card bill. | Not bad! I appreciate Chase trying. I think digital is their ""forte"", as their branches suck. LOL. They are always looking for ways to improve their site, and provide great tools to help with credit-building and maintaining. Glad I stuck with them and will update to 5 stars shortly, I imagine, as there are still minor tweaks they need to get to, but from recent past behavior, I don't think it will take them long to address. Good job, Chase (JP). Keep it up. | Doesn't let you send/receive money for some reason. Not impressed. | Easy to use . I really like this app. | Worst credit card bank app. It takes me longer to pay this card off than it does to pay ALL other bills combined. I hate this app. | Gives me my statement balance quickly after the date, and it has good rewards in the chase offers section. And it adds up your pending charges for you. If you're a credit card person, chase has awesome cards and an awesome app! | This app is currently having serious issues. | App doesn't work at all | Trash app for a trash bank. If there is a problem, good luck the bankers will give you the runaround sending you through a loop of departments only to have nothing get resolved. When you have someone wire you money it can be any time from 1 second to days. | I just made a cc payment. However, I've been trying to transfer funds from one account to another. It will not allow me to. The error might states they're having some issues, please try back later. Please fix, as soon as possible. I don't need it to go into OVERDRAFT. Thank you 🙏🏼 | Way to many random pop-ups when trying to do anything. | Zelle doesn't work! | App always tripping. | Worst Banking App On The Market! Wells Fargo app from 10 years ago is better than the current Chase app. Something as simple as being able to type ""Geico"" in a search bar and have all the geico transactions pull up on one page would be a huge technological breakthrough for you guys! Something other apps have had for over 10 years. It's pathetic.. | I use it alot for the convenience. | Nothing works on this app. It keeps saying a problem occurred; try again later. | Can't even log in to view flights and tickets, nothing wrong with my stuff on my end. I know how they like to gaslight you despite thousands of reports saying it ain't working and tell you to check your internet connection and update your app as if we're toddlers or old people. They also charge more than double the cost of plane tickets just because it's through them. App doesn't work right all the time and also has thousands of reports on it but they do nothing. Shady company. FTC report comin. | Keeps saying please try again later, will not let me pay my bill. | Rejects my login. | Garbage app, don't set up payments in app. It will drain you4 bank account as they try several times to process days later too. | It's a great app | Awful bank. Lots of fees and charges., if you aren't rich, they do not want you here | Easy app to operate! | I am unable to access my account whenever I need to. I am 85 years of age and I knew how to. The app keeps jumping around. And I keep losing my password. | Terrible. We get charged $ just for transferring to pur savings. If you don't have a minimum, we get charged. During account opening, the banker was not transparent with these fees. Now I know why banks like Chase make 9 to 10 billion dollars a year from customers just from overdraft fees. We don't even use this account. It's a place to hold some of our money. Why are we being charged for just holding money in there? It's absolutely ridiculous. | Efficient and reliable!!! | Not that good. A real lack of info after using the card. It does not show that you made a payment or did something to change your balance. Not good. | The application is intuitive, making it easy to navigate. Love it. | I have banked with Chase Bank for over 12 year's and they are a great bank. Clean, organized, professional, and overall very easy to work with when it comes to overdraft fee forgiveness. I have yet to try and apply for a home loan or car financing, BUT I know they have the tools and credit to make things work. Thanks again Chase Bank for being awesome! | The best bank I have ever had | It's just easy. Especially the check deposit | Cool! | Top G of banks | It is very fast and easy to use! | The company is a scam, they have two offers going on one of their cards, be careful, they don't explain that the offers are non transferable and so their mail os different then the online ad, scam company!!!!!!, and don't respond to my comment because I will never change my rating, as soon as I pay off thr card I will be closing down all my accounts with chase/jp Morgan and moving on, if I could rate this company less than 1 stat I would | Really like it. It's very convenient. It saves time. | Chase bank app is the best to use for account info | Great | I really like and appreciate the Chase Mobile app. | Great | Easy to navigate! | Won't allow the transfer between accounts after hrs.. Numbers procedure and nothing! And no explanation! | Awesome company to get back on track with my. Financial. Auto pay helps me keep my payments on time or early. | A dark mode would be nice. I'd like to see offers and promotional materials crammed into a subfolder to make the app look and feel more upper-class and performant. Other than that, fairly decent. | Never used zelle, but plan to use it soon.Everyone says it's a great tool. | Good! | Easy to use, easy to Zell. That's pretty much all I'm looking for in a banking app. I've never had a problem using the app from what I remember. So no complaints about the app. | Great | I love | Can't get into my zelle acct | All good | I can't get into I my chase account and I have to pay my rent now not happy at all | Perfect | This app works great! It has all the info I need! And very easy to use! <3 | The best way to get and send money | The app works well and stays in sync/updated with all my current transactions. I can access the same information and categories as if I were using a laptop. The layout flows well so I can find my most used options fast. Any changes I make are in real time payments. | Great! | Easy to use, I like it | Love it","{""1"":163350,""2"":43798,""3"":71227,""4"":200227,""5"":1324938}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","JPMorgan Chase","JPMorgan+Chase","chasemobilesupport@emailonline.chase.com","http://www.Chase.com/mobile",,"https://www.chase.com/resources/consumer-privacy","JPMorgan+Chase","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nSkpJQa6V2cjC0JEgerrwner4IelIQzg06DZY8dtGwRsq6iXcrxCX2Iop_VI9pohvnI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4_qZT-SW7eYInOmPDxFxoIwa7ksJUHnmJhPAMrmxFUTZvYlLwf4mzVmVbldbCkOZpw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SiMKYoM1z6P8nv5y-oPzKHVcuLUbhT_CdDzEc5HAHnXaIBPBwJAtAKNF_XWVaAHxHzM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/z_FYyzSjUXBV_cRUkTi8JCaElZBLI2EgMsjB8JlzwgFZiP7aLfqqMSGESD0kMRBpdckr"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GpxQEZMaS-zvsyWVXowMgk209MFr6oiQtpWKEBSMUtLgNtpOFXQcwazus8B1TSR8MuA-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tgRzwjZoYLRaZ7dLyvpmlfatBtErlegHx0wLQHUvUcevJCdJO9AlIW-I8KB5SVj5fPo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Jishn2tLRC5oGWHqeoTUUjOHiXKvdn6dfL1bP5BVfiVGtlXnjAUGA0YM8pr052IFQA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R-mgmfccHruaUGiKqpHbnFsd5LiHMbLpy9E5QHvGFCSFr3GaFcLv0uJW_TyAZ-N9V2w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wVxWHgUFmlIR-a4z56mic4ak1Xu5JWKWtmbF5PefKkztofrrl7G7gtsc1CxVzJB4pJg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EBHJnwdrP8uF7M-15C4jzDupv5c_7MD1f6W5g-rmrp-MeQZzTGLGD6NINPYvr-4iaPoH""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Nov 19, 2010",1713376276000,"4.513","We&#39;re frequently updating the app in order to give you the best experience.

It won't let you log in to your own account on roku and tried to change me a double fee just to listen to MY playlist.

Not only is this app breaching my privacy, it's not an ethical company. Have some decency and cut ties with AppsFlyer.

HEAR WHAT NEIGHBORS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT NEXTDOOR

“Before Nextdoor, I didn’t know there were several qualified babysitters living nearby and looking for work. It was easy to feel comfortable hiring my neighbor’s daughter to watch my son after school.” - Patrick, Mission East

“This year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor For Sale & Free. In no time, our neighbors stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else, and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighborhood.” - Dan, Hayes Valley

Sharing your real name and personal information with the public is not safe it's how you end a victim. | What an awesome app. I used the app to find my missing 15 year old dog. That someone mean took off while I was at work | Not limited to my area of residence | Used to be a great app now it's 90% Ads unlike other social media you can't hide or ignore a particular ad for being irrelevant or not something that you're interested in. I have just gone on to look for something going on in the neighborhood and absolutely bombarded with stupid ads for some new driving app, something that I will never do - not exaggerating when I say in scrolling through posts there were 15 of 1 It's a shame, I can understand having some ads but this app has gotten ridiculous. | nice way to meet new people around you yeah I enjoy meeting my neighbors online. After more time with the app I incountered some issues that bother me. DMs not getting received on time. Last night I was supposed to get some Broken terracotta pots from a neighbor, she didn't get any messages till today. I'm not sure what the problem was just annoying AF. | next door has been great for getting to know my neighbors! and also to help find work. | This app is the worst they suspend you're account for freedom of speech and they let others post your personal information I'm filling a lawsuit on them but want to suspend my account | It used to be good. Finding companies to do work for you and neighbors giving suggestions with a problem you may have. But now it has turned into a bully and a pick up website. I had a kid trying to make a date with me and i told him to leave me alone and If you take up for a person, your account is indefinitely suspended and the site will not tell you why. I will NEVER recommend it to anyone not unless that person loves the drama and bullying. | A poorly run app with moderators who encourage racism towards minority groups while favouring white supremacist perspectives. Guidelines aren't applicable to everyone as mods are influenced by personal biases. | Your verification system is the worst I've ever come across. Not only does your app claim my address doesn't EXIST - You have the GALL to say ""We can mail you a post card, it'll only take a few weeeeeeks!"" IM MOVING! I DONT HAVE A FEW WEEKS! Sick and tired of nearsighted development on apps and services, if I could rate lower than 1 star, I would! | I've installed Nextdoor a handful of times over the years (when something serious comes up like a lost or found pet), and yet each time it feels like it's only gotten worse & I find myself uninstalling once again. The feed is rampant with ads that are only subtly marked as such, with many of the ads trying to imitate a ""local"" vibe (even if they're massive corporations) in a way that feels sleazy & misleading. Worse yet, daily notifications from Karens complaining about the local laypeople. | Love it | Awesome thanks | I've only had it a few days but I like it look forward to using it | this is a great app to find resources in your community and get to know your neighbors. plus you can also help local small businesses. | Only in big towns | Interesting and productive | 👍😊 | It definitely has it's potential but just a haven for white boomer supremacy. | For me, it's the notifications that frustrate me about this app. I am not interested in national posts from this app, and more than twice a day it's pushing a notification ""neighbors everywhere like this"", your response missed theark, it misunderstood the nature of what I had an issue with, however the breadcrumbs did allow me to find the correct settings to adjust the notifications. | Doesn't work | I think everybody should download this app. it's informative and it's just downright neighborly I love it | There are quite a few people trying to sell stuff which I find a little irritating but there are some really interesting posts and it may be a good way to find a lost dog. | This company did a beautiful job remodeling my bathroom. very professional! | He was very helpful in fixing my car. He was very nice and professional. His prices were very reasonable. Thanks Jared 😀 | Moderators are way too restrictive and woke. | so far i love it ... | So far this site is good. Thanks for the welcome | Spams you with emails and makes it difficult and tedious to turn them off | Due to chronic illnesses, my nails have never grown, always had unsightly ridges and broke easily...until Future Nails took control! my nails grow well now, and look magnificent. Thank you Ally. | great app..highly recomended..communication is the key to beter living..safety.. | thank you | Hello From Avalon Park In Orlando Florida Good Evening, Morning & Afternoon Everyone Happy Holidays To You All !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | I would like to recommend Brian Richardson for any gardening work he extended my patio, and he was on time and did a great job and is very reasonably priced. I am getting some more work done by him shortly | Im pretty sure what this app does is illegal. The directions to get them to stop selling personal information don't work and the link you click for it just tells you how to ask them to stop. It's just a cycle of ""click here to stop"" and it tells you to ""click here to stop"" but it never works. You also have to go thru 100 different pages and disable 100 different notifications to stop getting email. I have done it 100 different times and still get emails I want my account and information deleted | Convenient says it all. | so far so good | It's nice to see what's going on around my area and hear the opinions of my neighbors | great way to connect with people who live in the neighborhood | Censorship 101! | Not to brag, but I am rarely picked last in kickball! | I am looking for work and am getting a lot of interest, thanks next door, you are awesome out there! | It's like aol. For starters at least 50% of the people on there are over the age of 70. They are very mad. But the worst part about it is the aging and decrepit app that is almost as fun as navigating myspace. You want some fresh posts? Too bad. Go ahead, pull down on the screen and see if you get new posts. You don't. You get the same posts that you've been looking at for 3 days. Every now and then one of those posts is from 4 weeks ago and now you're responding to it. Buggy. | Had been going to an aggressive dentist. Found Matt Stadler, his work is great. Prior Dentist wanted to do 1 new crown and redo 2 priors. All was good. Prices reasonable. staff good. Nearby Fred Meier. See him for interview.Bert 😃 | STOP....WAIT....DO NOT INSTALL. This app is everyone of the worst neighbours you have backed up by a gang of everyone else's worst neighbours all in one nice neat little anonymous council complaining package. Marketplace has no buyers...just people telling you why you shouldn't be selling. The services section is just old people wanting a discount on jobs they dramatically under pay for in the first place ... it's just a disgusting vibe and DO NOT INSTALL... It's of ZERO benefit to anyone. | Your app is negative and a disgrace to the neighbors you serve you allow people to discriminate ,harrass and cyber bully neighbors by letting them remove people's posts that obviously the neighbors enjoy and like . You and your teams of reviewers are disrespectful. | Great way to know the community | undecided | Why do I get notifications for posts that are 3-4 days old? Half of the time, the posts are locked or deleted by then. Ring gives me notifications in real time. | The wokest app in the store i got banned for posting pictures and liberals melting down at it | Lots of helpful information. | Pls separate into categories: Animals, services, suspicious acts, rent/sell, misc, etc. I've shut Next door down 3 times due to the huge volume of entries and inability to find what I'm searching for. | I have tried many time to delete this from coming to my email! And even after doing so. These notifications are still coming to me. I do not recommend this. | WORKS PERFECTLY ON MY MOTO G PRO 5G SMARTPHONE UNLIMITED 7549. | He's an amazing Mechanic and a great human being! | Next door neighbors won't let me download any pics or videos. I have no idea why or what I need to do. What really sucks is that Google Facebook next door none of these sites will help me. THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE IS TROUBLE READING AND DON'T KNOW IF I'M BREAKING A RULE OR NOT 🚫 I wished the rules were more understandable. And if somebody does accidentally break a rule, give them a chance to correct the mistake before their profile is totally deleted like Facebook does. Gbu ✝️😎 | Luis did a short-notice special job for me today. He arrived when he said he would, did the job thoroughly and professionally, and showed me he can deliver. I'm impressed! | I received a lot of good advice ☺️ thank you. I had to remove what I put up about tent people living behind my home and watching them pee and poo (I have video) next to their tent because it's against the homeless guide lines on Nextdoor. I didn't want to be in trouble even if I never stated they were homeless. I still like this Nextdoor advice from real neighbors. | Very good app, nice job!! | I won't raise my rating until the typing is fixed. I've tested plenty of apps so I know this issue is specific to Nextdoor, but when I'm typing the keyboard misses keys and deleting anything I can't just tap and hold backspace because it stops randomly in words. The keyboard on the app is a true nightmare on my pixel 7 and 8. | You start writing something and it will stop and write out the same thing again so it says it twice and sometimes with speech to text it will just keep stopping so you have to keep hitting the button every word or two. And if you want to delete a word or two sometimes it'll just start going back deleting everything until the whole post is erased. | Worst app I have downloaded in quite some time. It says I have a previous account, however I was today years old when I learned about the next door app and as such I could not have had a previous account. Do yourself a favor save yourself some time, don't bother | Nice to have. | Really cool neighborhood app. Definitely ☆☆☆☆☆ | Verry helpfull , But lately there's been SOO MANY SOB STORY'S, And Scammers , And I've never seen SOO MANY LOST PETS ITS SAD ! Maybe yall could create some sections SEPERATE ,From normal feed... And the way people are these day's, the critics are everywhere! Other than that , The App is too big for phones , it dosent quite fit the screen , Could use an update cleaning and calibration. | Carlos is a wonderful welder. He repaired a wrought iron table and 1 of the chairs. Picked up an dropped off! Absolutely hire him if you need any welding done. Great guy!!! Great work! | 17 sponsored advertisements. 1 cleaning lady post. 27 sponsored advertisements then 1 lost dog post. Too much advertising !!! Uninstalled. | Well it seems my account was disabled, not sure it can be reenacted, though I am open to reevaluate my initial misgivings and negative experience upon first interaction with this product.... | ATT:NEEDED VENDORS | Did a great job on both my vehicles back in 2022 for a general clean. Highly recommended | Too much sales related, not really part of my neighborhood, news. Too much spam and ads Not for me. | very good job well done | I love reading about what id happening in our cummuniy | ❤️ | A great app for keeping current on the important things that shape our community, future plans and events around town.....and yes the animals we love all the animals. | very informative | Thank you | How did you get my name, email, and location when I've never used this app or given them to you? Very suspicious. I wouldn't trust it. | Couldn't update all my other apps updated fine but this one just wouldn't update! | To much soliciting for funds and too much political vrap | pos | professional - guarantees his work! | This girl can cook, I have not ever had a bad meal. Excellent customer service 👏 | Cannot unsubscribe from emails. Looking on reddit, this seems to be a common theme. | Receive too many notifications outside my neighborhood. | Dustin came in and went straight to work. Very friendly guy. Worked fast and dependable. I will use him again. Thanks Dustin | Great site without being bombarded with adverts. | Do Not know Yet! Also is Ad's on or still used? | Thank you! | Limited usefulness, since its concept of ""neighborhood"" includes posts from miles away. And while I appreciate what is essentially advertising by local(ish) small businesses, there should be a limit to how many times you're shown an ad during one 15-minute scroll. | I'm new so I'd appreciate everyone's help.. | Wow, I didn't think anyone in my tiny neighborhood would be on, but I've already made a few connections and it's only been a day since I joined. | The review team which I was on until I quit likes to harsh core censor anyone they don't agree with hiding under guidelines in which we know most of the content doesn't truly violate them. They reported me because I refused to censor discenting opinions to the point. I quit, I called them out and the targeted me also and censored me. They're petty and petulant children and who needs this? Not me. It will get much worse. | Mostly a bunch of Karens on this app. Lots of unlicensed handyman adds. My inbox is bombarded with useless emails from Nextdoor. Some settings revert to default after 60 days, why? This app is a Honey Trap for Karens and incompetent handyman adds. | This app loves letting scam Artist and people always asking for go fund me scams to post on here every single day! But when you confront the scammers and question them about lying on here all the time. Nextdoor will suspend you for hurting the scammers feelings. Lol, they just suspended me. Idgaf honestly...I'll be back 🖕 | I love being on Next door meeting new neighbors | Hate it. This is just gossip ware. | I think that this app is good to have because it allows us to know what's going on in our community. | so far so good | I think you app is so stupid. You want ppl to look out for the area they live in and then when someone does and its about a serious and dangerous situation and you banned them. I think your priorities is so missed up and you'd need to sit and think about that.

When the AI got the coin wrong, there was no way to edit or correct the coin info. In one case, it failed to identify a gold coin and instead classified it as a silver coin with no option to correct it. In another case, it failed to identify the year of the coin and provided no option to fix it manually. Don't waste your money on this app. | I checked multiple rated coins. And this app gave a me a fraction of the price. Like bro these coins are rated at thousands not pennies. Be aware this app is misleading. | Wasn't accurate on dates got lots wrong | This is a great app for quick references on what your change is worth or if you have time to go through your piggy bank to see, potentially how much your money is worth! 5 Stars ☆☆☆☆☆ | yeah this is a fun app to have. never know you can find a good coin. worth a lot of money. it's like playing the lottery. it's fun! it really is | Great to identify coin | I love this app and my new interests in coins and history. | I've always loved coinsnap. it's great. I mean, the paid version is great. | I WILL, JUST STARTED,THANKS!😁🤓🥰❤ | so far so good.still new at this. | None | The money was taken out without an exact explanation as to whether I was going to purchase the product, and I made the payment without providing my credit card information. I feel very unpleasant. | did not grade accurately. UNC coin graded vf. | Best coin app out there. Thank you for no ads. | I downloaded app, try on two coins and uninstall app. They charged me for 25 euros for app that I don't have on my phone. | I'm just a beginner eager to learn | it's really cool | I would like my money back from this It doesn't do anything that I expected to do Noel does it do what it says it does to take a picture I can do that myself to recognize that it's a dime I could do that myself So can I please have my $4.99 back | No need it | I used it so exited to count up my coins and and see how much it's worth and then I checked one and it told me it was $83 and I was shocked and then I check it again and it told me it was 0.3 dollars and I checked that it said the same coin and checked it once again and it told me 0.45 dollars, so I was very confused, this app doesn't work well. Very disappointed. Creaters, please check the app again and tell me I'm wrong. | Awesome app!!! 😁👍🏼 👍🏼👍🏼😄 | STILL-Testing 123 +TESTING 321= | Advertising as #7 in free apps. There is nothing free about this app. Can NOT use the app unless you pay!!! | Dont let me load your app before you tell me I have to pay for it. | Could be better with the picture thingy. | so far it's been accurate with every coin. it's a pretty cool app. thanks 😊 | Works well most the time, would be nice if the catalogs were updated to at least 2023 | Lousy app. Not sure exactly what it's suppose to identify. I tried it. Didn't like it. | App is great!! Does exactly what I wanted it to do!! | this app is amazing | You have to pay once the app opens. ONLY a 7-day free trial. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👌🏻 uninstalling this app. This app also said it may share your info with 3rd party. Beware read before downloading. | so far so good | awesome application | Not good | working greater hope it keeps up the good job | AWFUL!!! Do not use. It does not work. The camera is spotty at best and it WILL NOT take a clear photo | nice | It's all a scam full of lies!!! | Not gonna pay $40 a year to look at coin value | good app | Requires credit card for a trial. | Product works well except the cost on the program says its yrly except they are charging monthly. I can't afford that pricing. | great app wish it was free | I love coinsnap | Loading issues | I'm still testing it out. will have an update soon. | Totally dig this app! It has to be the very best app experienceive for me thus far! It's very well designed, super easy to navigate, and most beneficial for researching coins. Though I haven't taken my coins to an expert or had them appraised by anyone, I feel that the app served me well, with a better understanding and invaluble amount of knowledge that I didn't have otherwise. There are several different options in app, that each in and of themselves makes the app cost effectively appropriate. | gave me a huge price gap with no explanation and didn't read the date right | It was enjoyable | great app | Wonderful ! | I didn't add the app on my phone a friend did and they charged me 42.99 and won't contact me back about my refund | Can't identify proof silver coins and slabbed versios. Is that working in the paid version? I like the app otherwise. | Very informative and satisfactory. | I canceled the same day I ordered. They still charged me for a year. Bad customer service. | it is quick and fun to do. | How do you cancel this subscription? | it's good | Not free | very amazing gets coins correctly very fun really worth it:) | Good | this is a useful app | pretty cool!! | Very good site.for a coin collector or just a regular person.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! DO NOT INSTALL!!! | Paid app | No good | It's not actually free | Very helpful | Can't use the dang app because it is a pay to use wanna be free app. Instead of making it an in app purchase, make da people pay for de app to install instead of free installation and then pay in the app. | no link to delete poor | I tried the free trial like Honey Hendricks did, cancelled it in time and they still took the money for the subscription. Even worse they tried the take it out of my bank account first and i stooled that one then on the 10th they took the money from one of my credit cards. I have so many bad words to call tbem but it wont do no good because they dont care. I could tey and get ahold of them like Honey H did but their not going to give my money back and they wont answer in the first place. POS's🖕 | Need to be able to discuss what I see not sure if they see maybe an explanation would be helpful but it's my first time to try this kind of app | I have collected old coin for many years | I wish i would have had this 10 years ago. | Still have to try | Amazing app 👏 has a lot of information 😎 🔥❤️ | start | Cool beans | it sucks I want to cancel please | I love this app.. so far my only complaint is when they show a coin error..It gives no description or reference picture as to the error for you to look for in it- it just says wrong planchet or stamped on dime etc..I would like to see a clear idea of what to look for and how to identify it or to show me what is seeing that makes it call for the coin error on my coin before I'm saving something that is worthless! So far other than that I have enjoyed starting this endless project! | It's only free to install. They offer a free trial but understand this cost | Very true and helpful collection sweet | Good information | It's hard to cancel anything it's a gimmick | Cool $$$ | A very good at Quick and fun 😊 | great app | awesome app | It's very inaccurate. I photographed the same coin several times and came up with a different reading each time it went from stating that it was mint state to fine to poor.

I've had a Wayfair credit card for a while, but never had a desire to purchase anything until now. The desk I wanted was $10 over my credit limit and I wasn't able to do a split payment online. I called to do it over the phone and they said they don't do split payments. Ridiculous.

I have no idea how this company is still in business. Calling them sweatshop quality furniture is a stretch. Is there a day the apprentices work in a sweatshop?

Way too messy. Is there a way to make that optional? | Cable provider sign in to stream shows on air is extremely buggy and often entirely broken. | How is it that the commercials play flawlessly, but more than half the time I can't watch the replay. Ridiculous. | No leaderboard results for the Zurich Classic. Nothing new in app since RBC. All other sports seem fine. | Update * espn hasn't been quality in years . 10/02/12This app is OK. It has information but it is not very good looking or fast. My expectations are higher then what this app provides. It gets 2 only because by default its better then the rest. I To many ADDS. | good | The 2w | Slowest sports app period. We have 5G everything fast but this app had not been streamlined ever. Deleting it. | kinda lame how my local teams are always blacked out. really lame that you do not have exclusive access to all espn games. if they are televised - I must be linked to my cable/tv provider..... why? | So sick of getting the loading screen | Horrible! Cant watch a game it continues to Buffer the game is on for 5 seconds then buffers!? The Very Good Watch ESPN app was great why did you smucks get rid of it? **5 years later it's a good app*** | alright | bought ESPN to watch NHL . watched the season games, but now ESPN won't let me watch the playoff games unless I get another subscription from a cable company!!! I've been streaming and don't have a cable company. I have Xfinity Internet. what a scam. | It does what you expect. no tech issues. | Paying the subscription and not having access to ESPN to watch the NFL draft?... Money hungry. That's what ESPN plus is. | Every time I try to log into my TV provider on the app, it shows my TV provider as verified, then sends me back to the TV provider login page. It does this in a loop and never allows me to stream shows that I have to verify my TV provider with. | Worst waste of money ever. Only reason it gets a 1 star is because there is nothing lower. | Worst sports app ever doesn't have any NBA or NFL and tells you to pay for another app to steam ESPN mother channel. Ridiculous in my opinion that you can't watch ESPN on the ESPN APP. GET REAL!!!! I would give it a 0 stars if I could. | Top | Worst sports app trying to check my teams won't load Peice of garbage | Good app for quick sports updates. | If I tell the app to not show notifications or updates to anything - I'd expect it to not show me random news notifications. Especially when it comes to getting updates on sports I really couldn't care less about. | doesnt work, messi rigged it | It's OK. | horrible app | Terrible UI and works inconsistently. PPVs are terrible, you are guaranteed to miss part of the event due to app issues. | ESPN is garbage | Fantastic app | Absolutely love it | App is slow too play videos. Does not open from the notification bar. Do better, please. | rarely ever loads or works correctly | Relentless ads | Useless app | It's aight | Notifications are a mess. I'm getting alerts for things I don't care about even though I have Breaking News and Instant Awesome alerts turned off. Make it stop. | how do we protect ourselves | Can't log into ESPN + with username. Only email. Paying for nothing | Have the breaking news turned off but still receive notifications. It keeps sending all notifications for everything. And it's all turned off. So frustrating | Literally paid for ESPN+ and can't watch anything on it. Tells me repeatedly to choose a TV provider why did I pay for the app? | I just paid for a subscription to ESPN+ so I could watch the draft. It says I still need to have a TV service provider to watch anything ESPN+ related. What a joke. Just another ripoff. And of course I won't get a refund. | This app doesn't work. I can't watch anything on this app I keep getting a message log out and sign in and still doesn't work. I have an espn + account and every time there's a live on espn + I can't wait it if my wife didn't watch hulu I would cancel my subscription | keeps sending me home screen when I go to get the email for two factor authentication | Can't get rid of the notification spam without completely disabling notifications. All I want is sports scores for my favorite teams but I keep getting breaking news even though I've turned that off in the app. I even have ESPN+. | Paid for ESPN+ to watch the NFL draft. Need a cable provider to watch on the app... If I had cable, I would already have ESPN. Didn't research, hope I save someone $11. Trash | Slow | Buggy and Doesn't Load | Dirt app! Pay and sign up to watch the draft but will not let me watch on TV only on my phone. You don't get what you pay for with espn+ | Satisfied customer | They replaced playoff series records with sport betting odds. Looking for a new app as we speak. | I am not happy I cannot watch ESPN without a provider. I pay the app, I should be able to watch what's there | This app sucks! You see ads but no content. You open a story only to find out you need a subscription. Too much garbage in the way. | I'm not watching a 15 second ad to watch a 5 second clip in your garbage app Edit: app is still ad revenue garbage. Doesn't even pull up the right video and then when you try to switch to the right one have to sit through another ad. Find an alternative for your sports news. | like it | Nice app love it | The ads in this app are overwhelming and repetitive. Half the time, the clip you want to watch doesn't even play after the ad you're forced to watch. An app this bad can only exist when there isn't enough competition. | Update sux... since the update, app opens correctly every now and then.. have to uninstall and reload for it to work.. | Have been an avid fan of sports and love getting content updates. It has now been years using this app, I kept thinking it was my new phone (Galaxy fold 4) that was the problem, but it has now been too long. The app will send me a notification for an appealing video link, but 2/3rds of the time if I click on the notification it brings me to a completely separate article. Not sure what else you want from me, I use the app every day and it still occasionally ""forgets"" my favorite teams. | If you're a sports fan and you expect to be able to watch sports on your phone you can't unless you have another provider. This is such a a blatant money grab and honestly a kick in the nuts for sports fans. Why have all sports on a app if you can't watch the games unless you have further apps.And it's not like they're free apps no it's literally cable Hulu and some much more which is stupid.Im not paying for multiple subscriptions make it so I can pay for the service I want. I WANNA WATCH GAMES | ACABARAM COM O WATCH ESPN. INACREDITÁVEL ISSO. | Want watch a highlight? Watch this ad, but just kidding highlight won't load. So watch another ad and try again. Surprise still won't work! Want to watch ESPN+? Thats too bad because if it isn't part of a blackout, the feed will stop and make you reload every two minutes. That's IF they accept that you even have an account. | This app blows. Ads load fine, videos don't play. | if you're not ESPN+, don't bother. If you have ESPN+, you have to continually enter your password and still can't access articles. | crashes too often | Good 😊😃😃😃 | Too many issues and the constant annoyance of answering whether I am sure I didn't want notifications? Are you intentionally trying to run people off? It worked. The ads work too well and too frequent. | Very entertaining and covers almost all matches from across the globe. Enjoying it 😍 | Score page now bulkier to show betting lines, which sucks because it makes the scores list needlessly longer.. Also, games that are part if the NBA/NHL playoffs don't show what the series is at on a high level (aka 'series tied 1-1') and you have to go into the score to see where it stands. Video player sucks: watch a 30 second ad, video doesn't play, back out, watch same 30 second ad, video plays. | Not Happy! Downloaded this app to watch an NBA playoff game. As soon as I logged I'm I was prompted to join the ESPN+ subscription service, so I did. I paid for the subscription, thinking it would allow me to watch the game. Yeah, NO. Turns out ESPN and ESPN+ are completely separate and different subscriptions and programs. Why don't they just call the app ESPN+ if that's the subscription they're selling you? I never did get to watch that game, and now I'm out $10. | This app stinks. I have many gripes about it, but the biggest is the video player never works on the first try, the player cuts out follow the advert and I have to refresh (at least once) and watch another ad before finally seeing the video. I'm convinced that this is purposeful, so ESPN can increase ad revenue. | Wow. Newest update took this from 2 to 4 stars for me. The layout is fresh and new while dark mode is finally available! However, due to highlight videos on the home page not playing correctly, it's a 3 at best. It really seems like they don't know what they are doing with this app. | I could have sworn I downloaded a sports tracking app, not a gambling app, but sponsor daddy says put that @#$% everywhere, shameful! | The app is just good. When alerts arrive on my phone and I select the alert headline I am not taken to the article referenced in the alerts. This is frustrating. | move a game to ESPN3 and then can't play video forever!!! | When trying to watch live on the app, it asks me to log in with my TV provider. Why would I need your app if I had a cable? Took my money, and I can't watch anything. I have a few streaming services, and yours by far the worst. | I'm paying for this service, yet when I try to watch a game, it tells me that the money I'm paying them isn't good enough, and that I need to pay a TV provider instead. I don't have a TV provider. Why the f--- do you think I'm paying you???? This ""service"" is absolutely, completely, 100% f---ing worthless. Don't waste your money on this scam. | App keeps closing on me and I uninstalled and reinstalled | It's not free. Bait and switch. You have to have a TV provider. | now there are 2 espns and they don't stream anything on the regular espn. | Worst app ever for Sports. One day I can watch a game on ESPN+. Then the next time I want to watch one, I can't. It says ""user not authenticated"". But it works perfectly fine on my phone, every time. It's the TV app that is complete TRASH | Absolutely worthless. Can't watch the local sports without having a TV subscription, can't watch sports center without having a TV subscription. Basically anything that you want ESPN for You cannot get on this app. It's pointless | Constantly getting ""Whoops something went wrong"" message. | awesome app.Must have if you like sports.Never bugs or glitches. the best. | very easy to understand | Advertising betting too much. | Will not open all the time. | You download the ESPN app, pay an $11 subscription for espn+ and then can't watch live games without another $10+ subscription to another app. It's ridiculous. If you don't play live games, don't charge people. Also, app is super buggy. Watched an old game, got kicked out of the video 6 times for no reason. | Here's my experience: I get an interesting notification for something I find interesting I click on said notification An add plays (100%) of the time Add finishes Play icon comes up Video won't load This is a terrible experience Can we have adds maybe 10% of the time Can we make sure video loads AT LEAST as well as the adds that load well all the time? Come on guys this isn't rocket science | why am i paying for ESPN+ if I can't watch any of the Stanley Cup Playoffs because I don't have Hulu. im already paying so I could see the regular season why can't I view the playoffs? | Stop doing web components or find a better APM!! Web pages 404, freeze, or don't load. I can't get boxscores right now. Been like that for two weeks. It'll get fixed. Then happen again. Get a better Observability vendor | The video playback is terrible. The ad works fine though, don't worry about that. The ad will load 100% of the time but the video I want to see only loads maybe 10% of the time. I don't know what I expected different from Disney though. I guess I will just use Bleacher Report. | This is the worst app I've ever used. I just paid over $100 dollars and I can't even watch a single video, aside from the ads that load 100% of the time! To watch an actual game you have to pay for Disney's other app or a cable company on top of this one. Do not waste your time or money here | If you like betting ads and pop ads, have I got an app for you | I really like the App but wish they added more widgets for Android. On IOS you can have a full scoreboard on your screen as a widget, on Android you can only add a small card you need to scroll through. | I subscribe to ESPN+ through Hulu and constantly have login problems. | App Update added all the ESPN Bet information I don't want. Is there an option to remove it?? More app bloat | For being the largest sports media company. This App truly needs a lot of work. | really dig this App. love everything about it. | My experience with this app is really bad, I have to uninstall and reinstall on a daily basis, dies not matter if I have my Android phone or if I have my iPad. The video feed is awful, most of the time I can't make out which team is which because it is so distorted, and the sound from that is very unusual that I can't describe it.

When trying to deposit check, app kept asking me to download mobile app, which I was already signed into! After several times signing out and in, it finally worked. Also, Deposit Checks Tab should be located in a more prominent place. | Excellent Bank! | I love banking with wells Fargo. They have always taken care of my needs. | The experience got worse when they reached out to help me. Plus, they show ads to you. | terrible service | It is easy to use. I am just now working with Fargo. Maybe it will be a good thing also | a lingering problem..attempting to move money between accounts (eg. checking to Visa) still does NOT work...after pressing ""continue""....the wheel just keep spinning... | User friendly! | I really liked how simple it was to deposit my check. Thank you Wells Fargo. | Excellent and convenient.🦈 | I don't use a lot of the features, but everything I have used is intuitive and works great. | It's been a wonderful experience | App is great when it works, but the last few days, I've been getting nothing but error messages when trying to log in, even on WiFi. | very convenient and assume | easy pezee | The app was working fine couple of days ago and suddenly it stopped working and displays check internet message, which is working fine. I uninstalled and re-installed, but getting the same error message. Not sure what changed. If anyone at Wells Fargo is reading this, please do not post a generic response as others are experiencing this same issue if you read their messages. Please fix ASAP. | The version I downloaded does not have the mobile deposit option. UPDATE 4/26: App updated on March 29. Still no button for mobile deposit. And response seemed like phasing. Asked for my account number: NFW! | really easy process | it's good | safe, fast, good 👍 | Everything went smooth works as always. I hope. | Great | Someone please fix the app. I try to sign on but it keeps telling me there's something wrong with my Internet connection and won't let me access my account. Other apps work fine. So it is not my Internet connection | thank u very much its really helpful | Kayla Ruffin was very helpful and courteous. She's a lifesaver. | The app doesn't work anymore. I've gotten error messages for the last 2 weeks. | It's all good | Simple | Message center is horrendous. I can't choose multiple messages to delete. You have to delete them one by one. The swipe to delete function is the stupidest design that doesn't even work. I have to keep swiping to delete one message because it never works the first time. Ai assistant is stupid too, not everything needs to have Ai now. | They are real professionals | Very good | Not able to complete sign on check your internet connection error. Doesn't work on wifi or on network after clearing memory and reinstalling or after restarting phone. | I have not been able to log into the app for the past month!! Anyone else having issues??! | great | great bank! | awesome 👌 | Worst banking app. Slow. You can't do anything on it. You can't report fraudulent transactions or even do basic banking without having to hop on a call or being told to go to a center. Borderline useless/pointless. | Good | The customer service rep. was vary helpful. | thank you 😄 | I truly can't live without this app. I check my accounts every day. You can set alerts to notify you about account activity so if, so much as a dollar moves in or out, you get a ping. Crooks can $20 you to death. Importantly, you'll be made aware of any fraudulent charges if you take time to look at the notification. Sometimes, you'll get a notification of suspicious activity. Best take care of that ASAP. The app and the bank provide very good protection for your accounts. | Haven't been able to sign in through app for a week now. I even reinstalled it and still not working! | Good | love this app | worked well | First impression, BRIGHT WHITE THEME ONLY! Please add dark mode. | Mehh | Amazingly fast | I have not been able to sign into the app for a week! What is going on?! Very frustrating! | Not able to download to my phone!!! | it just works, I'm lazy. | Haven't been able to log in as of a few days ago. Uninstalling and reinstalling has also not resolved it. Can log in fine on website or browser. | I am pleased with wells Fargo bank . Thank you for all of your services . | Very professional easy to operate very professional thank you | I have re-downloaded this app like 30 times already, and it doesn't work on my android phone. LAME! IT USED TO WORK PERFECTLY FINE. I don't know if the app was updated or what the case was but it has not let me log into my account for a month now. I keep having to go through the web. I always get a message saying to check my internet connection. I have used my home wifi and internet on my phone, same outcome. Or shall I say, no outcome. Two thumbs down. | Keeps me informed. | Im tried of this | Not too well.. | Easy P zeeeee. TY! 1st time also. | What's the point of swiping left and clicking the trash button in the message center? Nothing happens, a message can't be deleted that way. App is broken. | Having issues to get my card in 2to 3 business days | great and straight forward APP | Always smooth and easy to use 👌 | Not working now; it says to check your internet connection. | Fix your app. Can't log in due to internet connection, it's definitely not on my end. | the app makes rural banking easier. | Love wells Fargo Bank I have no problem with then. | I find it easy to use and very convenient | Wellsfargo is the worst bank.

Saying to check internet but it is working. | 👍 | great | Doesn't work half the time | Unable to sign in on mobile app. Can sign in just fine on a web browser. App is not working. | Too many updates! Takes up alot of storage space, for minor changes! | Easy to use. | This was a total pain in the a_ _. The WF person was not helpful at all. There were glitches, and it took 4 trys and 30 min to send money to another WF account! | super easy to use | Unable to update | Smh... not sure what's going on, but for two days, I haven't been able to access the app. I can use the 9nline site but not the app. This is crazy.

Always a problem. | every little thing help I love it | Used to brag on the app and company but not anymore. They've gotten rid of everything that made it great and you no longer get the free drinks no matter how many you've bought. Customer service rings and hangs up and they don't respond to emails! Back to QT and 7/11! | The best app I have! 👉 | Phenomenal may God Bless them! | Totally unfair if you want to pay cash you still pay the higher price because the idiots that work there believe that the program is only for people who have registered their credit card | Is okay | you can get free stuff | During a long day around here there is rarely anything like a polar pop and a circle k brand snack! | App did what they said it would do. | went to get gasoline ⛽ on my way to work at the circle K located at 8910 Albemarle Rd, Charlotte nc 28212, the cash register clerk has a terrible attitude and very poor customer service. I'm not sure why circle K is lowering the standards of customer service by hiring ghetto clerks. The young manager is also beyond his league | It's all good! And good morning | Get 5 free drinks when you first download | good service | Received a lot of free items! | sooooo many perks. this app is a must | I don't like this app anymore, it seems like there's not as many deals. | Great service and staff along with Great Deals on lots of items. Good job | Circle K is about the only convenient store that I use. All of there products are at affordable prices and the staff is super friendly for the most part. Usually they have ready for whatever I am looking for. Their store is very organized and clean. They conveniently offer an ATM inside the store. They offer coffee and various hot foods. This is a great place to shop at! Oh and the App is great. Your always getting free products. The drinking program is my favorite bc it's such a great deal! | A bunch of hassle with their discounts a lot of the time. But I went and enrolled in the easy pay just to not receive my $.30 a gallon off. Not surprising. It took an hour just to get the card accepted that was after I called to make sure it was registered before I went. I use Circle K a lot but thinking of trying other gas stations now. | ✨I love it here✨❤️💯🤞🏽 | It's a great place to get gas, snacks, cooked food and my favorite fountain drinks. | This app can save you some money here | love the,freebies 😍 much appreciated 👏 | Great | No. Not really worth it. I couldn't set my privacy controls either. I deleted the app. | Dope | For convenience store everything in one stop | I mean it's amazing you download the app and the rewards begin right away good job circle k I love the app | love it | Good | I love circle k. polar pops 6th one is always free. I drink a lot if polar pops a day. | Always Have A Great Experience At Circle K | Awesome | Best rewards app I have on my phone, so many perks, so many way to save highly recommend this app, works at any Circle K. Use it daily. | always great service | Great discounts. | love | this is great place to get gas | Would not allow me to verify age as requested of me when I logged on app. | I love this app. The free stuff is always great! Helps with the high gas prices. I would highly recommend! | Wonderful place to shop and buy gas. | Good ol app. Saves lots of change on the things you always get when you stop here | Need to enter update card | It's a good app, even better when your a Circle K Employee using it! | Employees are so friendly. | I have had nothing but good things to say about this app. They offer good deals, and are real about it. There is no tricks played by circle K. | Great saving | The best | Why am i only getting buy 1 get 1 free? I've been getting this 5 times in a row now? | is a great app to have and it helps a lot | For good discounts and free rewards all for zero cost to sign up..... Great. You are going to spend the money there anyways; why not get better deals and of course FREE rewards. love this app.!! | Just went in Circles trying to setup a debit account. Their system refuses to allow one to enter an email address at account setup. Failed in App and through web browser on or off VPN. Thats kind of messed up. Edit, tried again 1 week later because the gas station has no cards and doesn't know anything about getting them. Again cannot enter my email for registration! Called the support number. The rep was rude, argued with me that I couldn't operate with him until I am registered but how can I?? | POS app. Can't receive a text message to even set up my account. UNINSTALLED | It's just a fun place | My Circle K is awesome!! everybody is so friendly. | Absolutely worthless, I joined,I go in there is a banner hanging for 4 for $8 16oz monster energy drinks and I get rung up after putting my # in and he say 13 I say no it's supposed to b 8 sorry dude nothing I can do about that really? That's false advertising 1st off, why nowadays is the customer always wrong even when there is a sign plain as day, between the attitudes with the employees and the prices I will not go back I'd rather give my money to the Indian store owners least they are nice. | Ok | this is a perfect app to have to keep you hydrated and have to deal with other things from Circle K | Can't even download and make an account it says unexpected error | They are very nice and well respectable. I will return back there every time. | Very good | Absolutely wonderful! Going out of state, though, where there aren't any Circle K's. | awesome store | Love this app and my game's | Keep getting messages on Facebook to go to app to play,, then click on it. And casino game is no where to be found! | Good deals sometimes. | Great savings on gas,drinks, and snacks. Free snacks as well. | Great deal! | This is a wonderful app but I am having trouble verifying my driver's license or age. Can you help me? | Love the app | Awful app. Sms codes don't work frustrating experience. | Get 25 cents off my gas big help in these time also it a very well kept convenient store one stop. | there I so much ways to save give it a try | The app will not allow me to verify my age. Keeps saying age verification failed. I re-tried it several times. It also changed my date of birth. It shows it correctly on the little roller menu but it keeps changing the day to one day later and won't allow me to correct it. I can't see the cigarette selection because it won't let me verify my age. Very frustrating! | I love it! | it all good 😊 | I love circle k but it will not give me access to the adult adult product discounts 😭😭 | love this store friendly employees | try u | I really like the app it's helped me out a lot. Talk about the freebies that's nice. And the clerks where I go are very nice.

VPN related introduction

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.

VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.

Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.","Secure VPN is a lightning-fast app provide free VPN service.

Also, why do I have to create different ADP accounts for different employers when I can just have one ADP account. | great | Absolutely horrible app. It's always making me reset my password. | Very efficient | don't like having to wait for the day of payday to see my check, should give me more info such as vacation time accrued. I was forced to use this by my company! 😡 | used to work great now I keep getting network errors when I try to sign in I have Internet so something must be wrong with this app | I'm having a hard time getting my phone to work with my password and I'm also having a hard time getting my timecard to show up on my phone it's just not working right need some help with this matter what can I do ? | 👍 | ADP is not working | I use this app for work as a security guard, and man does this app make looking at my paystubs a breeze. | Absolutely rubbish. | The app is slow to load and feels a bit outdated. | siempre al dia con la mejor informacion de nuestros beneficios | Very bad experience with ADP. I can't see or download my paystub. There is a always problem. Keep saying...... (We apologize. There is a problem. Please try again later.) | Very organized 👌 | great 👍 | Unable to find my employee ID and information even after signing up. Adp to me personally is insufficient and useless because of the software is too technically terrible. | App keeps logging me out and will not accept feedback concerning deposits into an account that I never entered. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! | Constantly crashes, won't even load the clock in options, sometimes will clock you out at random. | Helpful | I love how it keeps track of everything and it's easy to use !!!! | Even after a new log in from my new employer, it still takes me to a job I haven't had in 2 years! | Well they've updated it... It seems. They sought the direction of Roomba Joe Biden and let his speech writers clean up the system | slow app | it's a great helpful app 👍👍 | incompatible with laptops and tablets | Terrible app. You can never see your pay statement, always a problem check back later. | Nice to go paperless and App is easy to navigate. | Very good | Doesn't work for Tecno Spark 10 | pay keeps say problem try again later | excellent up to check out your stamens. | App crashes every time I enter the password. Will not run. | is a excellent app | It's a nice app but why I cannot see my time card and also team card. My HR deptt. Also try to do it but they failed.how can I check my time card .four week before I can check and see it. But right now it is disappear from app. | Great | Everything is too slow and it crashes all the time. | Takes quite a bit of time to log in, and the splash after the login seems unnecessary. | good secure | so buggy!! | I can't even sign up or complete entering my info without the app crashing and closing down. Multiple attempts at this point. I have no other access to my payroll information and I need it asap. Figure it out and do better. I'm not the only one having serious problems with this app. Look at the reviews. Edit. It is now Feb 11 2024 and this app STILL crashes and will not even let me enter my information. Same problem, no improvement at all. Edit 4-25-24 Continuing problems. No change. | I can see amount of paycheck just no information beyond that. | very good and easy to use | Great 👍 | User friendly. love it | It seems like this app is programmed to work at 50/50 chance every time it's opened. One day it'll be fine, then the rest of the week it'll be broken. This app will go a full week telling me ""punches synced!"" and then proceed to not sync a single one so I'm left to manually inputting each one. Certain pages refuse to load half the time, for no real reason. Force closes/cache clears/phone resets don't fix it. The splash screen also takes up unneeded time every morning for punches. | very professional | I can't see my check studs anymore. | It's OK but it doesn't let me clock in from the app so I don't hardly use it if it would let me clxok in it would b awesome but | Sometimes the app let's you log in with no clock in option. I have to force close the app, open and login again about 3 times before I finally see clock option. This has causes late punches for me 😡 | Pay notifications are not working even though its turned on! The help feature isn't helpful, the message service is a bot. No human help at all. A poor service hiding behind a wall. An automated message asking ME to contact my HR department with their problem. My company is paying them for this service!! | if an app allows fingerprint sign in it should automatically prompt for that when you open it. | is the great! | The fact that mine makes me change my password Every 6 months is inferiorating considering i've been at my job for 17 years.It's hard to come up with new passwords. Half the time the app does not work and about a quarter of the time when you log in, it will not let you get to the homepage. | Rarely works,always says there is a problem and to try back later. App truely sucks. | this system I rubbish. never works, keeps blocking me for no reason. then the password reset won't work. it's not a user friendly program | very convenient | Not sure what happened but the app no longer let's me log in. It directs me to a web page to sign in and then just freezes. | It won't load online and the app don't work. Useless | Biometric sign in is bugged. Viewing documents in the app takes you to a website instead, which only says ""try our app"" and then makes you log in again. The name changes every year, so I never know what I'm signing in to. Not a great experience. | Worst app ever. Won't sync punches without uninstall and reinstall. | hangable app | Never works when it should. Any time I try to view my payroll, it errors out and says UNAVAILABLE. Which is quite literally the ONLY purpose of the app. If it can't do that, then what's the point?! You'd think a million dollar company could design a simple app that displays very simple information that's been input by employers but I guess that's asking too much these days. | Not a fan of the new updates, super frusterating. I've uninstalled and reinstalled thinking it was my phone glitching, but it is the app that is giving the trouble. | Very bad application, login it's self not working properly. May be the orgnization can develop the application with good developers. Till now I have used many apps but this is the worst. | Adp please yall got to fix the bug in the app cos I can't view my pay statement it's been 2months now cmon | Absolute Garbage. Can't access my account to change direct deposit even after changing passwords. App malfunctions, desktop malfunctions, HORRIBLE. | Half the time it doesn't work | Good | I use this app for work. It seems that everything is rolling smoothly | Doesn't work beyond quick clock. You try to sign in and it takes you to a login webpage. You enter your credentials and it just takes you to a white screen | Terrible software - had this app across multiple jobs and the same problems and bugs persist. Infuriating piece of hot steaming garbage. | App is very useful sometimes have problems | Worst app that I have ever tried. The app sumarry shows that my taxes are high than my total compensation, it looks that I am paying to work. Very poor organization of the taxes files, I have 3 Relève 1 and 3 T4 with the same name ""2023"". It is Impossible to know which one is the latest, on top of that, there is no date in the PDF file. If you want a company to deal with your payroll go to another one!! | Good | Missing basic functionality for retirement accounts. No option to receive support just a toy chat bot and send feedback button. | Never working Update: issue is still not fixed. | I try to get hold of them to create account with APD they didn't respond back | I've been trying to figure out why things I need access to are missing when I go into my adp, the service bot can't even comprehend what I'm trying to ask about and when I try to call support they don't have any automated options for my questions and just end up telling me goodbye. There needs to be an actual person you can talk to for support. | I have to continuously delete and reinstall the app to get it to only open once before having to do it all over again. | slow to load, sometimes doesn't display the page. difficult to navigate. various options available on the web are not available in the app. overall a terrible experience. | I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and have never been able to actually use it or Can't see any of my Pay stubs . need help can't get it so what do I do | App wont even open, web site freezes up, what a joke | One app I truly can't stand. It always logs you out and asks you to change the password, it's always a faff when you just want to see a payslip | Annoying. I tried to sign in and after clicking the sign in button NOTHING happened. App is broken. | Absolute garbage app. Half the time it won't even let you clock in or out. Timeclocks are not a hard thing to figure out, but ADP has managed to screw it up royally. | Why do I always get booted out? | Will not open | It's a good app and it helps me take care.What I needed to take care of | PW must be 8-64 characters, but you can't unhide it when resetting. This issue is over a decade old. By now most security settings shouldn't be trash, especially when protecting money or identity. | 4/22/24. Everything missing! Shouldn'thave to keep bothering my HR because ADP breaks things. Bother them enough & they may find new vendor!! ADP updates keep breaking things, & their solution is to go bother your HR department. Spent time yesterday fixing login. Today, retirement does not load. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops with each & every update. I shouldn't have to play games & be told to bother my HR. HR shouldn't have to reset my options that haven't changed after each update. | Why isn't my pay option opening up... How would I download my pay slip? | New update makes signing in impossible. App crashes during verification. Turned a perfectly functional app into an unusable waste of hard drive space | can you helpme somethig is wron with my up i need to clock inn it does not alowme | very satisfied with customer service and staffing.. | Great","{""1"":36313,""2"":9191,""3"":21194,""4"":56866,""5"":389996}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","ADP, INC.","ADP,+INC.","ADPmobile_feedback@ADP.com","http://www.adp.com/gomobile",,"http://www.adp.com/privacy/","ADP,+INC.","Business","BUSINESS","[{""name"":""Business"",""id"":""BUSINESS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/85xxdCjRGt9lcQA8KlFjneXds2rwRpIiNMwbthsQLnSYgST6JOhRlLEh2Pk-e3XakQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8cGkuqhv999-Q-_D0YqE-x_Y1YcRi2dzJP4kzvKi9s9AmLVkmI1LxOilxHg3NK39zY4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dixXD7KdxfzV-trXODnojwfBrCGvuJjYQQrJbLVsVy0E19qx9Fdtz2DI6dy-Cxuqjg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dPgNJUjXQT29VgtPMzmrUjb50oIHNN-ugDgd1E2vyPoxqVsu4VEoucdVoUyDZKYKDg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5mOfE5pvVlmyX2L-Dkr8a0qaB5EndRGUhWYtdKqftvYqaXL7EnN73IJjAgOuWGo9llpH"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Bg3E2WD1HyiXt-C3YC21fSS0Fx-ASQIuijomMHgtWO_w5bNDB8iVcWV0Adp5a0fHQ3w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7KvVmFbDPGM1EXeCb50-p5dx-WUgxTtkDp6elMcZSHtKuTq4KnSktFQB3hVRb65Ybw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/quF2ug0hXpvHH-x4s-anwXQkIYBs4C215034ltkACHAcIdlStbrE9Ivc0p93QMynJHA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fEf99m3VgXYmgQfAFlp5NtygHvbGPg1bHF37l3BNffMkX4O9LnYE3uxC6m_wjOW2B4c"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/998NQAbt_cuU4LDuWhrULlMQ-NwYcoytaFkeDzqAk0cxtJ62JzY4odQMiG6w5BbaCX0""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Apr 1, 2013",1713986650000,"24.17.0","This release of ADP Mobile contains minor usability enhancements and bug fixes.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.adpmobile.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adpmobile.android&hl=en&gl=US"

Thank u! | It's been about a month now with spectrum wifi 6. All Devices stay connected with a strong signal. no complaints so far. | Great internet, Tv, and Mobile | I like Spectrum, thank you! | awsome | fast. Great. top notch service. I cannot complain. 29.99 a month for internet, TV, and cell isn't a problem. I'm so keeping. :] check it out, you won't be disappointed. | great service | Awesome | Why can you just the settings page you need this stupid app yes I get that most people don't even know that you can change the settings on a webpage that consists of seemingly random numbers (to the untrained eye) but I do and I made the choice to go into my router webpage so I should be able to change my router settings with the router webpage!!! | Please don't go and get any service with spectrum they had f me over now I ended up went in the store back in August 2023 to get my Equipment for my TV and internet and the guy pretty much talked me into getting a phone so I finally said okay after I didn't even wanted it at all and I told the guy that I wanted insurance on it but then he never put insurance on the phone and then a few months later the phone got broken and I was paying 10 dollars a month at first and now the payment is 20. So f | I would definitely recommend both their internet and cell service. The only downfall is that when their discounts expired your bill goes up without them letting you know. Other than that if you want great internet definitely reach out to them. | the bill keeps going higher | love it. it's easy 😌 | Great app! easy to navigate and we can see all of our services in one convenient app! | +Makes paying the bill easy. +Makes wifi settings (General settings / Portforwording fairly simple) -(More of a gripe with spectrum) You cant log into your router the old ""Type an IP Address into your browser"" way. The app will get done what 90 percent of people need done What else do we really need? | Do not, I repeat, don't use this app to pay your bill. I was hacked by a Spectrum worker....double/triple charging me. Prices each month going up. Customer service did absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Wanted me to add more products. In all....they scammed me out of $1,000. New Bank card. Canceled provider. | I'm the | Thank You for readjusting my payment. | people at spectrum service very helpful. thank you | Shows are in Spanish that should be in English, closed captioning comments coming through even though cc is off. | The app refuses to sign me in, even after resetting the password. It also won't accept my fingerprint anymore, and has gotten worse and worse as more updates have been released. | Cody was AMAZING!!! He got house up and running again. | spectrum | Will not let me run speed test on wifi. | Channels, price customer service 10+. | equipment was delivered as scheduled . Easy setup. Easy pay | Easy system to use | need to be able to turn my services back on with a promise to pay option because im a disabled veteran and need to access VA.gov website but cant do it because my internet and phone got shut off. you know i even called them and it explained this and they told me that there was nothing they could do for me. i have had spectrum for a couple years now and it seems like their customer service has gone way downhill and their bills just keep riiiiising higher and higher like a hot air balloon. | They took away port forwarding | good security options. I wish some things were better. | I love this service !! | very helpful | View printable bill>download function doesn't work. I am using Samsung galaxy s24 | Please don't ever use spectrum. Worst support I've ever experienced and they randomly increase your bill. | great customer service | Great | easy way to pay monthly bill | Thieves | Not working at all (edit) It works now, but won't let me download my billing statements. It shows them, the download button is there, but nothing happens... Lame | Works great | The Chat Now function does not work. I've called and they are saying it's MY phone..mind you, the function worked before months prior | For some reason, my mobile information is not on my app. The app is treating me as if I'm not a mobile customer. | Great | Easy to use. | As usual when Spectrum gets ahold of something, no matter how good or simple it may have started out, prepare for a marked decline in quality and efficacy. It's downright pitiful and worse, it's gotten worse since I last had them as a provider. Their ""advanced Wifi"" is pathetic being unable to maintain a 5 and 2.4ghz network at the same time. And in true Spectrum fashion they hamstring the customer from managing it themselves with this crapplication. You can't even set the 5g/2.4ghz here. | Awesome Experience | I like the app and being able to resolve issues without calling. | The latest version allows me to manage seasonal service hold right from the app. No more need to call the support center! This alone is worth five stars to me. | Easy to use! 😁 | Biometrics does not work in opening this app | expensive | Trash because it ask me to update it | I was ready to cancel my service with Spectrum until I talked wit a young man that talked me out of it! This was after dealing with terrible customer service for two weeks or so. He took the time to straighten out all my issues, did some research on my account to see what was going on, and fixed every issue I had!!! This young man was by far the best customer service agent that I had spoken to in many years!!! Kudos to the young man that straightened out my account, and gave me a GREAT deal ! | there are some developers hackers in the it team of police dept bounty hunters using to invade power lines are the energy source ELS COMCAST BROADCASTING SYSTEMS | I am not a teck guy and don't know what I'm doing 1/2 the time. I like what I've seen up to know. | appreciate all the help with everything ! | Very good | Changedy number and no notifications never told us have had the same home number for about 20 years for them to change it without telling us at this point I'm going to another service | wish cable and internet were less expensive, but never have problems using app | good company | wish I can cancel a service through the app instead of calling you and hanging on the phone for an hour or two... | we always come through for eachother | App opens to a blank white screen | Good | Often I am unable to stream/view to my tv. | Need to let people sign in same time with out asking to change password & get that lower bill program back ! | Good | The app is user friendly and service is flexible, so far. | Problems with the app. The feature where you can use fingerprint to login. I always set it to login with my fingerprint but it still ask for my password. I've had to rest the password at least a dozen times in the past year and a half. What's the point of the fingerprint login if it doesn't work | simple and easy to use | good | Someone at my old age can do it, anyone can... very simple and quick..... Just what I like....🙂 | Best service by best company!!! | you can't beat cable internet. when you live in town. | extremely good service | Very easy to make payments | Customer service is an ABSOLUTE joke.. still garbage... Clowns! WORST COMPANY EVER lol | It's very convenient and simple. | excellent service | I'm having difficulty logging into the app. Usually take 3 times. Please advise, and no, it doesn't need to be updated. | Awesome. Best internet provider ever! | i like the conection | The app in the service are great. If you ever have problems with your other services, get spectrum. | Won't do anything but bring up a black screen. | Not user-friendly, especially when trying to report an outage, it just kept circling back to an equipment issue instead of letting me report an outage. | love it | This is a great APP. It makes everything more convenient for me. | very convenient | I love the service and how helpful they are when I do have any problems or questions! | Makes managing my account and paying my bill very easy. | Good | I'm a spectrum customer I've had my account with spectrum for 2 years they are both my accounts can't remember passwords 😭. I'm still using it but only on my phone 😔. hopefully your montring both.always saying I'm about to lose my ACP, I mean like really 🤦🏽. I'm watching TV on my phone 🤦🏽. that should count as using my Internet 🤷🏽 | Won't even load now. | I love how I can control what devices are connected and can set up schedule for when they can connect. | It's PHENOMENAL 😍🥰 | Great Service | 👍 | The app is easy to use. no Hassel. Thanks spectrum. My best experience with paying a bill so fat. Their service is a number 1 in my book. They even sent me a text telling me when they received noti e that service was out and expected wait time before service would be reestablished. Super helpful company. Real people and not left in the dark ever.

Never had any problems. | The service they offer is far better than the app, as sharing property links is often glitchy - but man, the property rental process itself makes it worth the trouble. | Put in the exact address we are currently staying at, (booked VRBO),and the property isn't listed.. very frustrating.... | Links being sent to fb messenger won't open up the property that is shared. | I've been using them for over 10 years and have yet to be disappointed. | Just walked in, and I LOVE it!!!!! | Has never failed us! | Do the app creators (or VRBO) even try using their own frustrating app? This app is frustrating at almost every tap or click... will not show entire messages, circles continuously, doesn't push Host messages, and (this may be a VRBO specific issue) does send a message stating the Host left a guest review, but doesn't allow the guest to even see it. (It DOES claim it will be visible to the guest after the guest leaves a review... which is patently false. Sounds like baiting for reviews to me.) | Cannot login on the app.... | great selection of villas in fantasic locations. | awesome app. | easy to use and great choices for places to stay. | Easiest way to locate your dream vacation accommodations! | Vrbo is now the only app we will book through. What you find is what you get. It is safe, reliable and affordable. Vrbo is the app to look on if you're ever going on vacation or just a one night retreat. Every time we book through Vrbo, we get the best results and it does not trick you into any other fees. What you see at the end is what you pay. Definitely worth booking through! | this site is user friendly and if there a problem with the house they will go to bat. | easy to use | good | Use to like it, but since it's updated it is really a struggle yo use. | Very smooth interface and easy to navigate thru. Detailed and precise | In my opinion a way better option than AirBnB. | Fast & friendly | I really like this app. Has a lot of listings and I've been able to stay in some very comfy homes. | excellent places. I am in Florida in a lovely house at a reasonable price. | great | Best places to stay. | Broken now | have scheduling problems quite often but enjoy the places for sure | never had a bad experience | Since you've added Expedia and Hotels to this app, it doesn't work on my phone any longer. | Won't let me login, asks about one key and prevents me from navigating. Only way to get app to work is to uninstall and reinstall app each time you use it. | Won't ever let me get in. Always trying to get me to sign up for one key. Already signed up | I have used VRBO for years and have always enjoyed our stays at all of the rentals. My issue is with their app. I appreciate their security measures, but the last update has got it acting crazy. I've been searching for a vacation rental for 2 days, and every time I get back on, I have to prove I'm not a bot. Then, after I click on several properties to see if I want to rent them, I've got to prove I'm not a bot again. I did their little bot test 5 times yesterday. That's a bit excessive. | App freezes, can't log in | Awful app. Links do not work can't see properties friends have shared | So many fun weekends! The comfort of feeling like you're home. | App is easy enough to book and communicate on, BUT I am notified by email that the host left me a review and I CANNOT SEE THE REVIEW!!!! FIX THIS or don't let us know we've been reviewed. | so easy to work with. | Great way to find deals and the ideal place. | i like being able to search, find a whole house to stay at and see all the expenses before i book. | I always use VRBO, but the new App is a real blunder. | Love VRBO, service and cleaning fees are too high. | There is no comparison between hotels and VRBO! VRBO every time no matter where we go. | Recently, I had to contact them as one of my booking had apparently been sold and the new owner was asking me for money.. The woman I spoke to was very helpful | I find better deals and locations with VRBO. | Love it but still has some kinks here and there as well as the One Key rewards program is a bit confusing. | Every experience has been good. | easy to use and the places I have gotten off here have been amazing. Just do your research like I do. I have not been disappointed | they have really saved me some money on flights and air b&b it'd be nice if they have recommendations based on your destination. make sure you know what areas to avoid in Nashville. | Easy to use app. Booking very simple. Great properties. | Nope, never again!! Decided to try this app for an out of town trip instead of Air BNB and was totally scammed. Worst part about it is the customer service is aware and say they don't care because they allow third party companies to use their app and they are responsible for refunding the money back. Long story short, I'm out $300 and nobody cares sadly. Didn't realize I didn't have a place to stay when I got to my destination so had to spend even more money booking last minute hotel stay. SMH | my girlfriend saw this one place and fell in love with it so I had to get it. it was so easy to book. | Great app to find a place to stay. Does not ask for 5 ways to prove your identity, like their competitor. Will use again. | The app puts you in a loop when you try and register an account | This makes my 2nd time booking with VRBO and they have met my expectations both time! | Host kept our security deposit, VRBO was absolutely zero help in getting it for us. Still don't have it. Will only use Airbnb going forward. | Brutally bad app. Search function is a joke. When you use the map view, and zoom in or out, the app will reset the filters which basically renders the filter function irrelevant. | only issue is the logging in. | Every Vrbo house we've experienced has been wonderful! | I've had great experiences. | It will not allow me to use my phone at all. It is continually asking me if I am a bot. This has gone on for 2 days . MAKE IT STOP! | Vrbo has saved us a lot of money. Most of the host that I've rented from are very easy going and accommodating. | great app | vrbo has been great for the past 4 years | app is questionable | I love how easy it is to find properties to suit our needs. | absolutely love vrbo! | I love Vrbo as a service. The app is great except that it won't let you view properties on a map, I can only do that on the web version. | easy to use | VRBO makes it easy to find the perfect vacation house. | I like all aspects of VRBO. I can share what I'm looking/researching with friends. I can look at the map to see where that property is located in regards to where the action is or the beach. I can contact the owner who can offer insight into transportation around the area or other things I would really enjoy during my stay. They can supply the kitchen with items you crave...fruit, juice, and supplies. And they take ownership for any glitches. The Reviews!!! They matter. | Great option over a hotel room! | Easy and safe to use. | Reliable and accurate listing of houses. | easy to book. Great comms. no issues. | Waiting for incorrect display of prices in my local currency to be fixed. Should be GBP not NZD. I'm not impressed. Don't want to book accommodation through VRBO until sorted. Reported problem with currency not being displayed correctly 4 months ago. Option to change currency is greyed out and can't be changed. Others have complained about this, but Vrbo seems ignore this problem. | Great site, so many amazing properties and is easy to use | love it | Fast to destination needed, Awesome download!!! | great options with friendly owners | Great choice , easy to use | oh yeah baby | I'm a very satisfied longtime user. | I cannot find the owners review of me in the app. otherwise I've had no problem | Great places to stay. Easy to use. | Won't let me sign in. App is freezing. | I've used Vrbo for three vacations, each time has been a great experience all the way through. | Great place to find a place to stay at a great price. | have had the best luck using this app and service | love all the options it showes and very user friendly | Great app | use it every time | love it | A pleasure to deal with! Bravo VRBO! | super easy to use? | easy to use great deals | Love VRBO! | Great communication! Beautiful Places to stay! Great prices! | best place to book vacation | My VRBO experiences have been excellent to date.

No matches on here and subscribed for a while now. Hinge has been better and seems to be more popular and active. | I got blocked from this app for no reason. wasn't given any explanation whatsoever. I'm not even entirely sure what it means to be blocked from bumble. Does that mean that anyone could lie & report you & you're done? Does it even mean that I was reported? This Is the most unorganized dating app ever. (I removed some of my comment so I can reply.) Um clearly you're wrong bc I was blocked without valid reason. Your response is terrible costomer service. have contacted support waiting for response. | ganda ng app nato | Paid for a subscription and literally a couple of hours later the banned me for absolutely no reason. I had one conversation that was going great and then this happens. What a waste of money. | Update, didn't even last one day, you lot are hilarious and full of it...😂🤣😂 | I have tried the premium version for this app once a year for 5 years dosent work at least Tinder worked for the first year the apps are made by the same company | Does not verify me properly even though it's clearly me on the pictur | Amazing | The option to cancel their subscription is non-existent. You will have to just call your bank and tell them that Bumble/Badoo refuses to stop charging you. Absolutely ridiculous and completely infuriating. | Full of bots and spam. Matches rarely respond, and nobody takes anything seriously on this app | Don't bother guys | Horrible app with horrible algorithm. If anyone likes you Bumble will force them so far down the card deck and then limit the number of likes you get to try and force you to pay. Don't expect to get any matches for at least 3 or 4 days unless you pay. Once you hit the limit the first time then you'll be limited to something ridiculous like 10 likes a day before it limits you again. Sorry but tinder far far superior Bumble | Doesn't seem right | You can put your name and picture, but adding other details requires a subscription. | I can't get the verification code or call when I try to sign up using my phone number l | I need help I can't get my photo to work | I can't view anything without premium membership but the payment option isn't going through either | . My P | not sure why you'd be able to use an app but not see anybody who likes you without having to pay for it. if you're going to do that, put a paywall before putting in all this information straight up MoneyGrab | This app is such a lag while applying for one week subscription it has merely deducted around 20 rs yet not able to subscribe fully The bot service is absolutely scrap | Recently started having an issue where I swipe on a profile, then the one after next is the same profile I swiped on. For such limited swipes, it is concerning to see that some swipes don't matter/count. Also frustrating that 2 likes have been sitting despite being in my parameters and setting distance to max. It's been 2 weeks and the app refuses to let their swipes be shown to me. | Can't even see who's trying to look at me without paying. Such a pointless app. A waste of time | I hate how I have to pay to see who swiped right, which means that I could miss that special one and never get the chance to even say anything. So many features are locked unless you pay for it. You don't pay to find love, that's like a friend asking you to pay them in order for them to set you up with someone. | Hi bumble... I Tried a lot to enter the program, I don't have a facebook account, I want to enter the program through my mobile number, but the verification code is not sent to me, please help me | more ladies | I thought this app is free, but they tried to charge my card for some I'm not getting & most of individual/individuals seeking dating are either out of state or country even when selecting near by location. I just keep giving it a chance, but still not going anywhere. | fantastic | Its optimisation is just worst | Don't not get this app.They offered the 7.00 dollar day plan,thought it was for one day.They charge you $7.44 per day.I cancel the subscription and still charging my bank.Ive cancel my debit card,and still got around my bank for the $7.44 charge for 4/26/24.I advise people to stay from the app and apply for other dating apps.Also there is no toll free number or customer support to change your subscription.You are on your own. | so far so good | Good | excellent | This is a terrible app, when ever you get a like of someone it never gives you the oppertunity to swipe to find out who it was unless you pay for a premium package which it's just a way of getting your money. The premium is way over priced, on the free core version you only get a certain amount of swipes till you run out of the free once and even then the person who liked your profile never shows up, again another money getting scheme from bumble. I would give a 0 star rating if I had the option | the pictures on the site are very clear. getting in contact with people is easy. | Well I didn't even try it just buy reading the comments I can tell it's not worth it | good app | Kept deleting my photos even tho they were appropriate. When I finally got the photos to stay after uploading like TEN times it wouldn't let me put my favorite as my main Bs | This app is NOT free! Sure you can swipe photos for free, but if you actually want to communicate with anyone it will cost you money you don't have! | Updated: to make matters worse, now you cant find friends or network unless you download another app. Worst decision ever Scammy and buggy. The app keeps crashing and I keep seeing weird men even though I filtered men out. They put on their profiles that they are women 🤮. No, Im not talking about bigender or trans women. I am talking about duse. Bumble really needs to sort it out | Uninstalled bumble to redo my profile then it has auto cancelled my premium and is now asking me to buy premium again absolute joke | It force you to upload ur pic and can't allow to turn off the location. | Not free, cant see anyone who ""likes"" you unless you pay.... how can i talk to scammers? Fake fake fake | it's good to be in control of who you can talk to | Sab bot bhare hai - West of time and money | When I tried to create an account it would not send the code to verify | very good.. been enjoying so far | Can't even use the app. It says they ""have reason to believe I'm underage"" despite the fact that I'm 19 with a full beard. | Matched with someone, but they won't show me who until I upgrade to premium for 50 bucks a month. I don't care about the free features if the one that matters is behind a paywall. | As an average (I think) looking guy, with common sense and whatnot..... I do believe that the system is made to make you believe that if you pay, you'll get more matches / interactions. Well... 0 matches x 2 matches after you pay (from which are probably bots because they don't reply back) = 0. Basically nothing works, 'thanks' Bumble for giving hope but the app doesn't seem to be designed for users! | Did not enjoy my time here. It kept telling me I got likes and matches but demands I pay to see them. Waist of time. | Don't use it. Unless you pay you don't get matched or get messages. Total con. Avoid it. | Awesome ! | I was charged full price and can't log in | Why have I stopped receiving matches suddenly ? I used to get quite good number of matches earlier.... Now nothing! Even after paying for primiem & using spotlight. Check my algorithm | Tkmmmm k.kmi.kkk.m, | This app requires you to pay just to have a good experience. Instead, you have to wait for something to happen. It's boring. | Bumble owner must be increasing his/her wealth every second because fooling customer are very easy . | Good | Hello can't open the apps, because blink blink. Please fix bugs | to | Good | Very pleased whit this app thanks 👍 | Good | Use a temporary card number if you get 'Lifetime'. They will bill you again, their customer service does not seem to speak English, and end up having to dispute through the bank. Edit: Laughably, they immediately replied to 'e-mail their customer service' to this review. I already did that. They refused to refund my duplicate billing and had to go through the bank. This company DEFRAUDS CUSTOMERS. | awesome | Too many obviously fake profiles | good | Great | good | Back again with the 1 star review | Not good | Still giving it a shot, but hoping to connect with someone to explore this new life I've been given. | Ridiculously expensive. - 12 quid for a weeks sub? Yes, I know your core options are all free. You don't have to remind me. Literally, everything is behind a paywall. You get about 10 free swipes a day. That's it. At its basic level,your core features are dreadful with how limited they are. Anything extra you need to pay quite absurd prices. - the women don't message either,and you lose the match,. Whats the point in it? Just unmatch if you can't be bothered. Stop wasting peoples time. | op | not worth not working no match will find ever on bumble | Yes I like your site app how to meet someone special | No one's on it | Fully wastage app | super | 👍 👌 | Am downloading but isn't yet a cepting | I met my wife through this app! Before that, of all the apps I tried, this one got me the most matches that led to dates. As with all dating apps you have to pay to find more success, but for me it ended up being a great investment. | Buena iniciativa de app, aunque parece cortada por el mismo patrón que otras, solo aparecen pitonis@s bien pagad@s para resultar en ningun match en la vida real | On the surface this app is a good idea when you actually get into it this is just tinder with extra steps. 24hrs for women to make up their mind is insane. you're lucky if they check this app once a week. The extend option is also useless if they only check the apps once a week you're always missing matches with this model. | Good | 90% of the pop ups are fake. Nothing has changed on this app. | App blows | App is decent enough, but you CAN NOT use it without leaving your phone's location services turned on. For me that's a non-starter | They make it incredibly difficult to stop paying them for the upgraded subscriptions. | Full of recycled accounts. | Good 😊 | Can't have a conversation in date bc you're locked out of sending the first message as a guy. And none of my matches would ever send the first message before expiring. Which in itself is a strange mechanic. So sadly I never get to talk to anyone. | Cannot set preferances. Seems like age and distance is set off profile but ethnic, build, and relationship are not available. | You want to charge for every little thing which is ridiculous I have 28 people that like me to where I can have a soulmate right now but no I can't see them unless I pay so you guys are really not a dating site you're here to sell and make money not help the fellow person out this is ridiculous it's all about greed why can't there be a dating site to were you meet people and not have to pay for it this is actually prostitution | I had this app for almost a week and no one has responded or liked or anything my profile and I paid a of money and it sucks | great | Unable to upload my picture | How do I obtain information from the developer regarding updates? I want to read about what is being updated before I update the app. TIA | Can't open the app | I have tried to tell them stop pulling money out of my account but somehow the money is still coming out of my account I called my bank and the bank even said they don't know how they doing this so please stop pulling money out of my account.","{""1"":179408,""2"":38965,""3"":92553,""4"":152330,""5"":564099}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.49 - $259.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Bumble Holding Limited","6810146070790225259","android.support@bumble.com","http://bumble.com/","The Broadgate Tower

I can't g3t out and to live in this town and not being able to normally get anything. I'm pretty much house bound and giving someone a list I never get what I want. This grocery shopping with Hannaford is the best | So far, so good at Sprouts. | I'm still learning how to navigate the app, used it twice. It went smoothly. What I like is that the shopper/deliverer is identified with name + photo, and they and I can message each other. If I've forgotten something, I can add items up to the moment shopper is at the register. The best part of the experience was the shoppers themselves..they're smart, know how to choose replacements for items not in stock, message you for your approval, + are polite. They arrived in appointed timeslot. | Super fast | The customer service is helpful.Drivers friendly and product exchanges satisfactory.Good job! | Very good! | The app works decently, but there are some issues with replacements and the system for them For example, as soon as a driver is assigned you can no longer select replacement options/refunds for items I'd they're out of stock. Also, when you approve a replacement the shopper makes, if you request a different item they can ignore this request entirely and just leave the item out of the order which is very frustrating. | Totally scammers! Ordered groceries on april 10 and was supposed to be delivered to me by 8p.m-11p.m, but when I got home, nothing was there. After complaining to them, they literally deactivated my account and never to return my money, stay away from these scammers! They will keep your money and will block your account. They don't care about their customers but to keep their money only! They don't even deserve to operate. Their app should be removed once for all. Not recommended. | Scam I was charged 99$ Sub without me knowing I did 4$ and cancelled it they don't give refunds | So far, so good with my orders. I would have given 5 stars if rotisserie chickens didn't run out so often. But to be fair, that's not Instacart's fault, me bad.🤭 | Easy to use. | Very easy app to use. Both shoppers were awesome | Excellent service. | They add is everywhere and it annoying but other than that love it | Great experience, especially since I have a hard time going up and down the stairs. | Everything is always delivered within a very reasonable time and communication is great. | I tried to sign in and I :can't sign"" it's blocked|. they owe me $180.00 Never Forgotten or didnt colleced this amount :b food smart. call me Please | Excellent!!! Instacart great shopping from your home, easy, convenient. Especially when you have a disability. Also you choose your store! Thank you!!! | Very convenient | 🛒Instacart makes ordering groceries easy! Simply add whatever you need from a store to your cart, pay (including the extra fee and tip, which actually isn't more expensive than actually going to the store at times), then wait! I like how shopping is handled; You can chat with your shopper (and should, if they need assistance) and can let them know what your preferred replacements are. 💯 Instacart handles bad orders amazingly; If a shopper doesn't do a good job, support will make it right! | Great app | Great job convenient and I love the service | They deliver my food right to my door. I love this app. | They are number one and doing a great job 👏 👍 | I love it to order from Aldi :) always perfect | I love having that to go to the store myself and having somebody else do the shopping for me | It's been 24 hours and you can't even help me this ain't no way you treat your elders especially with health issues | Great Experience. This is always my go-to app. I know exactly what I'm getting and I really like the convinance and transparency of this app. The drivers are experienced and respectful. Thanks for hiring a mini me Nancy Dunham Toronto | Great service, quick. and friendly | Love this app | The additional Instacart fees and prices of items in comparison to their in-store counterparts have gone up 15%+. Our membership no longer provides discounts and service fee adjustments it used to for us. Stores have even said Instacart forced them to raise their prices to reflect the ""instore price."" This app was perfect for those in need transportation wise. I hate seeing it price out the people who need it most. | Good | Love the service and the app has improved so much since COVID lockdown. The cross-platform feature allows a seamless shopping experience wherever i sm and whichever device or laptop im using. Recommend! | I've never had a bad experience really | Shanae was absolutely awesome | I love instacart!!!! Being an over the road truck driver this comes in handy for me. Sometimes I don't have the time or energy to grocery shop for myself. And being able to order what I want when I need it is a just wonderful. So thanks Instacart I really appreciate you and your driver's | Horrible they don't help at all they say I have multiple accounts so then why couldn't someone text me and let me know that instead of just disableling my account and not saying anything so now I can't work for the because I'm of that there system keep telling I can't create a account it not my fault the last one I did finally went through | Excellent 😃 | Amazing app had great people delivering for me. | Excellent | Tis a very good service. | Never get my order to the proper address. | So far so good 😊 gotten everything I had order. The delivery person are always friendly and on time 👍 | A great timer saver ! | The app is easy to use. Customer support is very helpful when needed. A worthy service for a busy working parent. | My husband has Brain cancer and I am disabled; we don't drive, instacart has been a game changer for us. | Good for bigger towns | Restaurant Depot is not providing the right weight. Therefore, it's impossible to process the order. Instead of 2 boxes, each 40lb, it's shows 2714lbs. Please fix it. It's been like this for weeks already. I spoke to customer service last week, and they told me it will be fixed in a few hours, and it's still not fixed. | i like the online choices available and how the app works | This my first time ordering thru instacart. I just hope i get my delivery. | First time user and seems simple to use. | This app/ delivery service is so convenient. Make sure to check your email to receive great promos and discounts. I just got $40 off $80 for my next 2 purchases. I had to apply them to my app from my email. The delivery charges are expected and minimal. Use the chat feature to communicate with shoppers and driver. | The Customer Service has gone down hill in the last few months. I used to really enjoy the app and got good service. Not anymore | It was delivered on time | For the most part, good. | Simple and easy to use. Since we do majority of our grocery shopping with Aldi, our instacart membership pays for itself 👍 | Always gets my order right compared to other services out there. Good Job, I use Instacart several times a week, I have their membership which is under $20 a month. What I love about Instacart is the convenience, so if I'm busy doing household chores or other work I don't have to stop what I'm doing to go to grocery store. They are also great for last minute planning for breakfast, lunch and especially dinner, when you realize you forgot to thaw out meat or your just totally out of a product | Great | Very convenient when you don't have time after getting off work in a long time | Great communication and substitutions. Always a good experience | I was completely in love with this service until I wasn't. This service was awesome until it wasn't. In this typical day and age there should be no issues with updating times and cancellation of your order. If you're guaranteed 30 minute delivery and the driver isnt at the store 10 minutes before you delivery it should be flagged immediately. On the same line if you want to cancel your order you shouldn't have look for the cancel button it should be right there on your order to cancel it | Fast and dependable. | Life saver | Awesome | On time. | Ease of finding what I need. | They really help me out alot. I walk with a cane. Very happy for them. Thank You soo much. | I have never been able to shop with insta. Very stupid app. Just got done talking to customer service agent who was completely no help. I have never used insta but my account is locked and apparently can't be unlocked. Like what!? Dumbest app ever. The website has never worked even from my desktop and app says I'm locked out of an account I have NEVER used. | Easy online experience!! The only con: It acts like it's loading even when i needed to click on something or type in something in order to continue. That's the only thing that held me up, which took a little longer because, like i said, i thought the page was loading when i just needed to click on something. | Love this app | This was my first time using this app . I usually let my son order for me, but I decided to order myself, and it was so easy and convenient . In the future, I will be ordering myself . Love this app | They told me that all was free if I spent $35.00 or more I spent o writing $100 .00 and they charged me $30.00 so they play to many games for me | I have had good experience with grocery delivery. | Please ring door bell on arrival | I had issues with my order and I sent them a message about what happened. I haven't heard from them after 3 days. I went to fair way to try to return the items. Their prices are lower than what instacart charges and the couden' help me because I made the order true instacart. Not fear, not professional | Convenient | Brianna is excellent... | It sure why but while opening the app I am directed into a web browser first. I then have been opening playstore to open the app, this way I'm not feeling scammed. | I love this app. It saves so much time and money. Allowing me to take advantage of deals at stores I don't go to often and have my items delivered the same day. | Exceptional service every time... easy transactions & fees aren't too bad.. ALWAYS TIP YOUR DRIVER! THEY DONT WORK FOR FREE | I've really enjoyed using Instacart. It's so nice having the option for priority delivery. I've also enjoyed their partnerships with peacock and chase. | Excellent | Everything was fine. | I love this app. A great way to find local markets in your neighborhood that provide grocery deliveries. The items presented are usually accurate and the workers who grab your items stay communicating during shopping to ensure they grab everything that you need. | First time using intacart. It was easy to use and quick. Saved a lot of time with my busy schedule. Will definitely be using them again | Efficient service | Very handy for a busy family. Saves time and trips when you need to do four things at once. | I'm not happy with instacart I quit using them over a year ago because 1st they take out more money out of your account than what you owe and 2nd I've had several orders that I paid for the items and didn't get them and reported it and still didn't get my money back. And 3rd yesterday I ordered $68. Worth of groceries and they took out $90. And then was refunded for 2 items which brought my total down to $61.82 and the $28.18 still hasn't been put back in my account. Know I don't have any money. | Very convenient if you don't like to go to the grocery store with all of the people... Yuck its so much easier to just shop on the couch and wait for them 😀 | Great app easy to use, however you can't add to your order once it's been placed | Picked up everything on the list. Texted me as well and also asked if I needed anything additional. Ryan. Great driver. | Awesome service! | 1st time ever, order complete but not yet delivered. So far so good! | Game changer! I spent way too much time and money in the grocery store. Getting extra things I didn't need. Now I just order and it's dropped off. The shoppers are always great. I don't spend 3 hours going down each aisle only to forget something anyway. App is easy to use. Substitute or refund, even add while shopper is there. Great communication. I've only had positive experiences. 2 growing boys and a full time single mom. This is a no brainer. More time with my kids in the evenings | Great and safe, easy to use | Delivered to wrong home...did not read directions | Ordered never received order. Yet kept getting promises the were comming under priority. No one could find my order. Most frustrated!!! Did not order a priority charge | Excellent service. | Book order for n grocery, vegitable and fruit needvmore time for first order or later.","{""1"":36532,""2"":8986,""3"":10530,""4"":24151,""5"":190979}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Instacart","8459937269124330718","happycustomers@instacart.com","http://www.instacart.com","50 Beale St, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA","https://www.instacart.com/privacy","8459937269124330718","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g_irOkVgCmmyGOxAoB5-N6CuHYjL7FMiHUkO7FJFNBVKE3W-yoFoKJBiq4Sy8sSI9woQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5dWMW0F3r88UhErYRexxcUIV2juuNH43pNIkMNjk-c5bhzhaLlTMgnNx5mPA8DP75w","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OqDSy5veRWo2XkPOyPXbSZT1as-96jF6GPRdRmLVrgphdb0WSqmxqwTPzbZucpB3QNyB"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eAXlaKp-WvIynsRVYeBV7JFeR25k3SNk_A2smulwU0UyOMAaTem-d1oik5GBBu2Rqg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aALguSRjjR73N9rM1e43pdFxtdHDe-pdKaQA91p8EAKBQdD8N9NCOPb3NIuCpyRcYoI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4FIDpi2w8aRlOh8miBMi81-vsKlP98Hmsm_ITNaSDC45N61tgBgqlwe-Pfv1SdAR2Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eQVdmG7jfBfzV9BZuq7hBMsUn6MvE-3LUKwsrt30f4VVBOB4DwlNpCWO6gxSi79tE2E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7mFvWZMujZbEXwpn5xo3le5HD1UE_eKWshaR6eDl0C77UxpOfNHc253INZqJD8EjJbc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nRXtjCvbQpih1VzsSH0QOjtzSLmxP4I-V4rQfl4DZTNBLu1j7qwgzzxdL4J5o6C9Cg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FVieSo5C5PP0yApcXLp4ApdXQtXZNVfWNBN6pPQ3VBe6UB6iDCFA8aGWw1HhEJyyhlk7""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/By-H6m2-sV4?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5dWMW0F3r88UhErYRexxcUIV2juuNH43pNIkMNjk-c5bhzhaLlTMgnNx5mPA8DP75w",,"Everyone",,true,"May 1, 2014",1714169051000,"8.15.5","Delivering fresh groceries on your schedule means our app is always evolving.

✔ Guard your sensitive data
With NordVPN, your online traffic travels through a secure encrypted tunnel. This way, it’s out of reach for cybercriminals eager to snatch your private data. No proxy server or privacy browser will give you this level of security.

✔ Stay one step ahead
Enable the Dark Web Monitor to get an alert if your credentials are exposed online. This way, you can take immediate action and protect your compromised accounts before anyone can get to them.

✔ Enjoy high-speed connection with NordLynx
It’s our fastest VPN protocol built on the backbone of WireGuard to bring you blazing speeds and bulletproof privacy. All you need to do is tap “Quick Connect” – you’ll be connected to one of our 5,400+ servers in seconds. It’s almost like traveling on a virtual express train!

✔ Fail-safe protection
Working with sensitive information? Turn the Kill Switch on – your data will stay safe even if your VPN connection drops.

Outrageous!! Makes it absolutely useless. Please consider well before long term subscription | Everyone raves about this app! I really wish my experiance was better. I definately want to try it again soon. My phone probably just needed updated. | Advertised as best VPN for China, but only list Hong Kong. Of course, you don't mention this until after you set up a subscription. | Ah yes, a free trial for 100 bucks. Nice scam you're running | I think it's pretty good 😌 and it's great for deflecting hackers 👍 | I love this vpn, it's really save and secure | Attention à l'essai gratuit de 7 jours, j'ai du le prendre avant sur un compte Google et à nouveau avec un autre compte. Débité pour 1 an d'abonnement sans possibilité de remboursement. | use on PC and glad to see it an android. everyone should use it | good | call me. we'll talk.not violent. | not working | Lost.access when i broke my phone. | Was loving it but now after I purchased here on play store I cannot get it to log in on either here or my laptop! Yet I paid almost 13$ for it. Says account limit reached and will not confirm the account!! | My NordVPN won't update!? | Very thorough application, better approach than other VPNs in terms of protocol and functionality; allows greater configuartion to specific device and is a company to believe in especially with their 'no-logs' policy. | very good, and fast. i recommend using this vpn | Great app to use | Good | I cancelled my subscription before the trial ends, return my money! | don't know yet, just got. | Where is the ""Widget""? You should have one for On/Off on homescreen. Please add one and then 5 stars.. UPDATE: April 26th - Where's the Widget? Also, the notification icon to turn on/off is gone. Please bring back. | is very easy to use | Useless | until now the best on the market | so far it's a good app working good. | I recently downloaded this program within the first 10 mins it kept self deleting itself. I tried sending a email to support no support. Each time I attempt to it kicked me out idk even know if this review will even post. Not a fan the only thing I got to see was the app open up after that it closed out. | NIce | Good vpn but sometimes gives trouble | Terrible. Wouln't work on new android box running android version 13, so swapped box for version 12 and it wouldn' t work on that either. Support was dismissive when i asked for a refund of a year left on account, because over 30 days. Buyer beware. | How many additional devices can this be installed? 6 or 10? or is it a single license? | bokachoda vpn sala download korlam subscription kinta bola bara | Nord VPN is by far the best. That's all I've got to say. | Cannot login without MS,Authenticator, abd NordVPN made it difficult to explain how to do that. | Good | Good VPN | App won't connect while ad/ tracking services are blocked. Currently, will not connect at all | I will never use this NordVPN again. They charged $200.00 on my Visa for a 1 year subscription. I contacted them about this issue, and they did absolutely nothing. | I love this app because it is fast and strong | Best👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 | very good | i have to pay to use. duumb or its just inunderstandable still dumb though | The default notification settings send you at least one unsolicited add per day. C'mon. You already have my money. Stop begging. It makes you look sad and scammy. Also, across all platforms the app is slow and clunky, and drags down device performance drastically. A vpn app should never be using 25% device resources. From the highest rated vpn, the user experience is surprisingly bad. | Just no | I have completed what you ask of me and now your sight is on my phone I did not receive the gift that you promised by accepting and downloading this app to my phone go Monopoly apparently I hit the jackpot so now I need for you to fill your end and send me what I w o n thank you | thought this was meant to be private | Ok it's good I use it for banned games like GTA see what if tiktok was banned no problem all you have to do is download this it will put you in a different server which means I can download tiktok if it's banned | Good app | Excellent choice! This is by far the very best VPN app out there!! 10 STARS!!! | as highlighted by many reviews, they have a very misleading policy on the 7 days trial. You will end up getting charged. | very good | Permanent notification nag screen | The connection almost never works, it says it's connected to whatever country I select but no Internet gets through, most of my subscription was wasted due to the app not working properly no matter where I connect to. Very disappointed. | great | just installed it and it asks me.. | Signed up for a free trial as advertised in the app and was immediately charged £96.99. Now have to wait 3–5 days for a refund as authorised by Google. What a scam. | excellent ops. good and fast connection. easy managed | So far so good this is the most reliable VPN | It's OK..... However, seems hit or miss to work every time...... I'm sure it will get better.... | This is bad af..... Always required money | love I it's one of the best I have used | MeiN ĶampF ·iteralmènt Tøtttaliß d'AbsoịomA'Ð ⛎️👨🏿‍🦯‍➡️ℹ️™️🕉🪐🕉🌙👨‍🦯🍑👨🏿‍✈️⛎️ | Works as advertised, has no issues across my home network, and four devices. | Good and great | Terrible....dont let me to signup | Best app ever | Excellent vpn, but can't afford the price. but recommend for work. Thanks for the free trial. | 4/2024 Update: connection will purposely cut when there's an update available also. __________ Would not recommend this mobile app in its current state. Frequently will stop connection until you manually open the app, and either restart/disconnect the connection or choosing a different location. It feels like this is occurring more and more frequently. Adjusting the VPN Protocol doesn't do anything to fix it, despite trying multiple times. | I'm very happy with Nordvpn! I recommend it for Everyone! TY | under review | OK | love this app | i like it | Despite paying for the service, I get pop up ads for their other products, with no way to turn this off. This happens both on the Android client as well as the Windows client. Avoid unless you want to pay to still have to see advertisements! | Good | most of the time not connecting to servers😡😡 | Required account to use | Awesome! | Can't get in to enroll in the program | It just works | Waste | very good 😊 | Lately is no warking | Not for poor people | very good speeds. limited protocol options. | Not acceptable for me. Idk why it won't let me explain in the description. There is only a loading circle. Also, you gotta expect a rating, good or bad, if you gain access to peoples phones & we still have to subscribe to your services. Enough said. | The Nordvpn working very good but , The interface is very confusing So please improve UI( Graphics) the Nordvpn, The last time I used express vpn , Express vpn UI is very good and easy to use | Slow | I'll change the country, to USA. | Fast. Rock solid. | The best VPN out there. I've been using NordVPN for 5 years. Never let me down. | Used to love Nord. The downfall happened with the expansion to other services that don't communicate and have poor documentation. (Incogni and Nordpass) I want one master password for all services. Not 3...4....5....8. | yuuu | just make the app be paid | My appologys. Being frutrated with my problem regarding another service wrote not flattering comment by mistake. | Can't sin in | Best one ever | Sangat tidak di rekomendasikan, gw langganan sudah lama pakai NordVPN, tapi akhir² ini kalau dipakai di Laptop speed internetnya turun drastis dibanding tanpa Nord VPN. Bayangkan bila Nord VPN aktif speed Internet (download) rata² turun drastis di 6 s/d 8 mbps, begitu nord VPN diaktifkan speed Internet normal di angka 98 mbps (pakai indihome).

However, just a heads up: I find the Timelapse feature very annoying but useful at the same time, however it would be good if you created a manual slider to see satellite imagery at different dates like Google Earth Pro. I guarantee that I and other people would find this very helpful if this was implemented into the app. However, no 5 star until something is done about it. | Very good 💯 | The app is the best just 1 issue.cant you guys update the app to 2024 instead of it being old | Wow I really love it, I'm a geography nerd so this helped me out a lot | Helpful | Super cool | I found biringan city | Suuuu | Good | She's not I can go to do my sakit sya sa kuya Muad kuludan a good day for Buddha and ketsuni so I can go to your eat my gytat | Google Earth has many interesting features and hobbies that people enjoy!

I'm literally pregnant and homeless, so finding work is difficult; especially with me being from a big city. If this app actually makes money, now would be a good time. Even if I gotta leave already used apps open, at least if I can make even $100 a week, that'd be a blessing right now. | Super good and simple to use | So far i have had a good experience I really do like the concept of this app super easy to use. Only down side is I feel like even if you spend a good time testing the app it really isn't enough time to earn a lot with the time limit some of the game take way to much time to reach a significant amount of money but overall good app. | Love it so far . It's very user friendly and explains in easy but efficient detail. Only thing I recommend is to allow cashout before finishing all tasks that way you don't have to cancel the whole thing if you don't want to wait until complete . I definitely recommend this app compared to others I've tried.I will be upgrading my score once I cash out . | Total scam waste of time when you try to verify what you've done it doesn't allow you to and just keeps giving an error then when you try to report the error won't let you do that either | Awesome!!! | Love it | Good app | Couldn't download any of the apps | Good app so far great games to play. | Testerup is a fun and easy way to make some extra cash doing what I like to relax... play games! Plus the games are actually fun and good quality. App tracks your progress very well. Really enjoying it so far! | Doesn't work at all | Pretty straight forward. Nice to test new games. | The app does what it says it will. | Before i would receive my payouts automatically now it takes 3 days to get your payout I don't think that's right because ppl need that few dollars at the moment | I really enjoy testerup! | Love it | I Love the Testerup App. The concept is amazing, and it has tons of games that everyone loves. Play and get rewarded at same time. Best App I've found. | The best app I could find to earn money while playing games on my phone | I like testerup it one of the few app that actually pay | I have tried downloading 5 different games on my android phone & NOTHING will download. I've rebooted my phone & still NOTHING. I'll be uninstalling this waste of my time. | Love this app. | I love this app. It's easy to use and get tasks done. | I love using testerup, because I can complete tasks at my own pace from the comfort of my home. | Has a very well easy to use layout of their app. Wells greatbso far! | Great app. | Great app I love the games you can play | I like the concept. So far everything seems to work great, time will tell I've had bad experiences with these sort of apps in the past but this one seems superior. | I love this app ,I keep making money for playing games I love u should at lest give it a try ,what do u have to lose.u will love if if u just try it. | Didn't work for me | I like this app and the card ncept but I think the payout threshold is too high. I have also experienced several glitches that have prohibited me from my full payout. | Love the game selections to play. | A fun way to make money | I love this app you don't have to pay no money but you can make money and it comes very quicky wife did it and that's how I got into it I just wish they had more games but I really love it | I love this qpp, one of the best like it. I would recommend to anyone who loves gaming and getting paid for it! | Great app for earning a few extra bucks while playing games | I like the idea of playing games for money, I like how they don't have a time limit for the offers which is nice. I have only just started but the offers are amazing. | It's almost impossible to ever get to payout game stop recording progress and support ignores your emails don't bother | Amazing Amazing Amazing | Fake doesn't pay out at all | Good luck | So far, it's been good. I wish I would have started playing Monopoly Go after downloading this app, though. | I enjoy that it shows your current progress on each single game, plus there's no delays when you want to withdraw. | Definitely legit. Took sometime to get the face recognition to work, but they did pay out. | This app gives great rewards for playing great games. | Haeven,t use yet | This is an amazing app and I am looking forward to testing many of the games since they are all fun games it looks like | The Fun games refuse to load and or everything runs super slow and it takes actually forever to get to the withdrawal limit | The app seems to be a bit glitchy, but otherwise functions well. | This app is awesome! It really pays! | Easy to use glad to make a little extra cash | After a bit, the app will no longer connect to the games you play so you can't continue completing goals for that game | Love all the variety of games that this app offers | Great app easy to use, lots of variety on the types of apps | Its awesome great way to make money | Good!!!! | I was referred by my sister who loves games and every since I've started I've enjoyed it. So many options of fun games and actually getting paid to play! I've already cashed out so I know it's legit! Enjoy | Great app, it's just a shame it is only viable in the US and Canada even though it gives you the option to select UK as part of your address and shows monies accumulated in £. | Free money?? Love it! Having an extra income always helps! | Fraudulent app! | Incentive- I love the idea that I could make money playing games I play anyway! | I like this app I have earned a lot by just playing games they recommend | I love this app.... | After doing all the challenges they ask you to do, you still don't get paid | I love the tester app because I can play the games I love and get paid for it at the same time! | Not a scam. | Easy to get lost in games the money adds up as you have fun | Super awesome. So much fun! | Love this app | I Everytime I try to click on the game it won't take me to the link 😞 | This app pays real funds all the games u love to play and get paid doing it it's a win win🎉 | Great app for testing games and earning rewards! | I love the games; however, it is not very user friendly is notifying user if tracking and other permissions are correct. | I tried this app it never tracked any game I downloaded cosmic rewards is better I've cashed out 2 times and 2 weeks I'm up to another cash out now | I love the tester app because I can use it. To find new games and explore while I'm earning money. I'm playing my favorite new games that I discovered through the app. It has a very good user interface and is easy to understand and install new and fun games and activities. | Lots of apps to choose from and very descriptive and detailed on the rules of the offers | ok | I love the opportunity it presents to get paid for playing games! | It was really a great experience to use this application, it has lot of offers and rewards if we stick to the plan to earn a passive income. | I like testerup because I can participate in paid task. Comfortably from home | So far decent just started playing.. Will update later.Enjoyable app to play. | I'm not sure how well this app will work. So far it's looked good but no offers have worked. | I like the idea of being able to earn a little extra cash by testing apps and games! | I've been a gamer since I was a little kid. Only we didn't have video games lol. This is be far one of the best platforms to actually make money on. Y'all are so stinking sweet whenever I've called customer service. | Looking forward to seeing the benefits of playing testerup games. I hope there are more games to choose from too. I Lil confused also..as if I need to always open the games inside the testerup app or just go directly to game app itself. | I LOVE THIS APP IS REALLY WORKING I RECOMMEND EVERY ONE SHOULD TRY IT. | Hopefully when I reach 70$ they actually pay me | I'm giving one star because I've made 30$ so far but now every single game now says oops not available to you so as of right now I can't play any games so I will never get to 70$ doesn't make sense this app is useless when you can't download any more games. | I love the concept. Great idea, designers. Thanks for the opportunity to generate some cash. 👍👍Very well put together. | Lots of fun games! | I've been playing with testerup only a few weeks. But I like the games, the fact you can earn $ is cool. | Testerup it's a great platform to earn extra cash by testing out new apps and providing value with feedback. | It actually pays, no ads!! You can play many different games and recieve money. Follow the instructions or you will lose the insentive | I love this app. I have so much fun and you earn money. | Don't waste your time | This is my favorite play to earn app I've come across yet! I really can't wait to see my earning potential. | After finally getting to $69.20 I ended up stuck at that amount for over 2 weeks trying to get to the 70 dollars needed to be able to cash out! I made in app purchases to speed up the process and after about 15 dollars and no progress, I at this point was pissed beyond recognition! I was running out of games to download and was able to get soda crush to level 25 and to the 70 threshold. There is no tab that keeps track of the games you download to make it easier to keep track of, need I say more | Great games and decent payout structure one of the better games in Ive had | So far so good! I don't like that you have to earn 70 dollars before you cash out, however if you have A LOT of time on your hands this is the app for you!

I set up rocket money and found out that $2500 went to the casino last month! Fantastic App. It has really opened my eyes to my finances. | why download this app when all u have to do is open ur app store click on ur profile scroll down and click on payment and subscriptions | App is pretty much useless. Some of my accounts haven't synced for 2 weeks. Putting account syncing behind a paywall is pretty stupid. Update: Emailed customer support as DJ suggested. Relinked accounts to see if the issue is resolved. Accounts were synced but data is still from a month back. Giving it time to see if it updates. | This has helped my budgeting so much. I highly recommend. | I might have actually signed up for your paid plan but although your app looks like you it's very promising, it just doesn't work. I don't have the time to constantly restart when it freezes. If it doesn't improve in a week or so I'm deleting it and revoking access | Forgot that I installed this years ago and gave it a poor review. The ads are flooding social media, got me to try it again apparently. Still sucks. It doesn't sync my accounts accurately. Signed up for premium in hopes that it would actually cancel some of my subs for me but all it does is give you instructions on how to do it yourself. Am I doing something wrong? I'm taking another star. 😅 | Excelling app, helps with budgeting | Pretty good site. It's helpful | Its very helpful, but there are still subscriptions that I know I pay annually and it doesnt show it to me, so I might forget them even if the app helps so for me it doesn't work, its shows me what I remember already, but stuff that I'm sure I'll forget it doesnt show me. | Stellar service for those who aren't familiar with money | they purposely make it difficult to tell between premium and free, don't mind paying but until I've tried it out. attempt to be a little more honest and clear about what people are signing up for smh3 | Work really well it's nice to be able to track my finances | Very organized | I love rocket money | This has been such a helpful tool to have all our finances in one place! | Cannot edit budget amounts for monthly bills. App is worthless | They negotiated with Verizon and told me that I saved $100. Next months bill was $25 higher and they bullshitted me. | Amazing! I appreciate that they want to help me budget and set financial goals. Cancel what I don't need! I wish I would have had this years ago! | Useless. It just plays on your ignorance. Just read your bank statement and you can figure this out on your own. | Love it!! | Great | Excellent app for budget management. | Great! | I am the world's worst budgeter and even I can see where all my money goes and how to stop that spending and lower my bills | Best app ever lowered my bills. They negotiate for you...awesome. | Accountability. This app encourages you to be fiscally responsible & shines a light on spending habits while providing a ""in one place, 1 click away"" look into bills, subscriptions, fees, etc. I canceled 2 subscriptions because of the app & re-evaluated others because I realized how much I was spending. The BUDGET feature is huge and further exemplifies how - if used correctly and often - compels you to be financially mindful of money going out & in. Wish FIDELITY could link | Really good lightweight budgeting and financial tracking app. Not as powerful as other tools, but very streamlined and convenient | Very useful app | Great | Very easy to navigate. Shows all debt and old subscriptions. | Chefs kiss | streamlined easy setup process | Plaid is very slow to add credit unions. Which makes it unfortunate that Rocket Money does not work outside of Plaid. Therefore, this app is useless to me. | Very thorough and app has great insight on helping you manage your money. | Installed this app to help me save some money. After installing this app, my bank notified me of a fraudulent charge on one of my debit cards. Uninstalled the app after this and will not be using this app due to it's lax security features. | Very disappointed. Not free like they advertise. | Stopped working after the first month | App is super buggy, and super slow. I've contacted support about issues with rules, and while they had kept me updated, they seem to have given up. Very useful app, unfortunately they seem slow to fix issues | Honestly Just a lifesaver when it comes to savings | So far 15 random people have come up to me and have gotten access to my bank accounts and tell me how many subscriptions I have. What is Rocket Money doing about this? | Very surprising I'm very happy | Pay to used app | This is a great app! It helps you save and manage your money. It will show all your subscriptions and cancel the ones you no longer want/need for you. It shows your investments and net worth. I give it an 11/10! EXCELLENT!!!!! | I love rocket money!! They help me stay on track! And help me reach my financial goals. | This app is great. I love that I can see all the activity across my accounts in one place! | Free version doesn't let you add additional categories to your budget. Seriously?! Also, it's absolutely ridiculous that they ask you for a donation to use their FREE version of the app. Like how greedy can you get?! | Not free. Basically a subscription service itself. | love it! | I guess if you're inattentive this might be good.. but when a ""recommended"" cancellation is my Internet bill.... The company is kinda useless 🤣🤣 | 😍 | Great app so far, pay what you think the app is worth, and they keep track or all bills and subscriptions. | Great wonderfully. What a great way to have all your life's headaches all in one place. Thank you Rocket you guys are the best. | This app is amazing, I know what bills are co.ing due that week. Just fabulous!!! | I've done the link process 3-4 times. I got notices from my banks that my accounts are linked, but the app is stuck in a loop to link my accounts. | I like being to see where my money is going, and it helps me remember what bills I have paid and what is coming up. Makes budgeting easier. | Used bill negotiation, Company ended up raising prices a month later scam app don't use | the app is awsome. highly recommend using it | It keeps changing set dates for income. Like my settlement money comes in on set days bit on one it keeps pushing back the dates of at least 3 days instead of what i save it to be. | Very good organization | Easy-to-use | Terrible app and deceptive service. The bill negotiation is a fraud operation, they want half your savings when Experian has a better service for no cut of your savings. They tried to claim a higher savings than I actually received and they were rude when I pointed it out. Do not use, back to simplifi | It's really helped me get my spending under control. Now, I can work on my shopping addiction that I use to numb myself to my memories in the Boy Scouts with Pastor Dan. | I dont know whats with mine but I use chime and the stats for my account balances, card numbers and total amount of subscriptions is wrong. Only thing right is the transaction list lmao | Excellent | Love it so far so helpful | Rocket money is helping me get a handle on my finances. They've been so helpful this past three months. I can't wait to see what is to come for the rest of this year! | So far I really enjoy it. Teach me perspective | This app helps me keep track of my recurring bills. Very good experience. | So helpful for budgeting and staying on top of things!! | Very easy to use. I had subscriptions that I rarely use. It helped me save money immediately. I also enjoy the auto savings account. | Rocket Money was good until they started using Plaid to connect my accounts. I haven't been able to update my banking accounts for several months! Rocket Money knows of the issue and is still not working. | WARNING ⚠️. This Rocket Money app will NOT FIND ALL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS. It is misleading that it will cancel subscriptions. Do not fall into it's trap. If there was Blank Star I would use it for Rocket Money app. | They helped me cancel subscriptions I forgot I had and it took seconds | In app cancellations. Awesome | I got this because I wanted to see if I had any subscriptions I didn't know about linked to my credit cards. It makes you put in your checking account information. I know I have zero subscriptions in my checking account so I don't see why they would need that information. | 1 have tested at least 8 top budgeting applications HANDS DOWN The winner Rocket money Every other platform: - Lack of flexibility in categorizing transactions, resulting in inaccurate categorization and limited user control, and inaccurate financial recording, - Incorrect income recognition from sources such as refunds and internal transfers, leading to inflated income figures. - Inability to exclude internal transfers, making it challenging to accurately track and manage finances. | Thought all the hype from influencers was bogus, really actually worth it. Makes tracking all your accounts easy because everything is in one place. | I'm sorry, it really does seem like a well run app, but the login process for company specific retirement accounts is trash. This very well could be my retirement account holder. Also, why can't we create a budget around our minimum monthly payments to our credit cards? They don't let you divvy up budgets between incoming and outgoing payments. This app is great for people NOT in debt. Not for the rest of us. | Great interface, and so far, it's consistently dependable. | I've been using it for 2 month. This app has helped me stay on top of my finances. | Amazing. | Very good, just won't link TSP. | Just like almost every other app for organizing finances after Mint turned to poo when bought out, this one also makes you sign up and enter bank data BEFORE they tell you must everything is for a membership fee. They claim free services but seeing how I can't get past the sign up page to access anything, it seems more like a bait and switch. Deleted app. | Did not see the value. For my subscriptions, it just told me how to cancel them, it did not cancel. Plus, it was difficult to find that feature even though it is heavily advertised. | Greatful app and helps know where all your money is going. | App won't send tex to log in deleting | Im learning how to use this app. I must saw it helps keep me mindful of what im spending and doing. This is really a useful app | I like the app alot. It gives me a day by day look at my finances. Easy to use. | Just started using it. Able to cancel bills I forgot I even still had subscribed..thanks rocket money! Not a paid promo or bot lol just keeping it real | I have been using this app since it was True Bill and it's worth the yearly charge. With it's help I am fully aware of my spending and easily keep track of everything. It alerts me when bills are due and my account balances. It's clear and concise. I really appreciate the easy to understand charts and highly recommend this app for help in building your credit score. It really is a genuine help if you're trying to get a handle on your spending and keep track of a budget. | So far it has been a real eye opener into my spending habits and where my money goes.

Love the street view, the satellite view, all the information! | The app was great but now it no longer shows listings at all. I've updated the app and it still doesn't work. | Great | It is horrible how the app is set up with the popup on the bottom of the screen it just makes it so difficult to use it it constantly has a mind of its own as it pops up it would be much better and easier to control if the pull-down screen was on top | It was great till they started pushing social views in ads. | Wouldn't let me log in. Wouldn't populate available houses | Desperately needs a ""Mark Unavailable"" button for use by prospective buyers/tenants. So many properties listed are unavailable even though they are listed. It's infuriating. It wastes so much of my time. | It would be nice if we could filter utilities, especially filter out well water. | Over priced! Many OLD Homes in need of repair and Upkeep. Bummer! | Not enough filter options to avoid notifications on properties I'm not interested in. | Exceptionally Great Coverage | Good! | got a new phone now it won't show summary of property | Quit getting in my way with these stupid pop-ups | I've been searching for an apartment for about 4 months. A lot of these property management or landlords do not respond to you at all, and if they do, they take about 2 -3 weeks to respond. Some are even asking you to fill out an application before even viewing the unit. This app sucks | the app crashes every couple of minutes and has serious performance issues. | it's a wonder app, all one could ask for | Confusing, not all are for real. Look out for thieves! They will try to get your money and run! | Incredibly helpful! My family and I were successful thanks to Zillow! | shows too many apartments and duplex after you say you only want to see homes | I gave a one because even setting your filters doesn't help you.Filter out things you're not looking for looking for an entire house.The entire space and this app continues to bring up room rentals.Wasting my time and efforts for hours | I am deleting this app because it's really unusable. For price range there is no ""range"". No matter where you start on the price, it says ""or more"" so you get 1 and 2 million dollar homes that you don't want. I haven't been able to figure out how to change the location. It just keeps showing me homes in the town I left, and I'm not even in that state anymore. I'm not using this app anymore. | Lot of scams for housing | Couldn't even find ny location. POS | The values are guesses, but the data is super. | Love the app, but miss the scrolling through function when viewing multiple houses on a map while zoomed in. It seemed a bit unnecessary to take that away | normally I have no issues with this app, but now I can't even get it to open. Otherwise this is a great app | terrible the customer support is just terrible and no help at all, they don't even reply till months later | Hard to navigate. Notifications are erratic and cannot be fully disabled. Essential features like saved searches are hidden. | Who put this on here | Zillow has been awesome in helping me with my posting, thank you all BIGLY 🤜🇺🇸 | Messages unreadable, ui is a mess | 7 Starz Great App! | Requires login. Doesn't send confirmation email. Unusable | Awful app. Way too many notifications, search doesn't work at all.. Pretty poor showing and a good indicator of how little Zillow values prospective home buyers. | Waisted of time and money we have invested 2 months worth of time and application fees into this app for applications to never be viewed or be contacted back. | Ok but needs to add more / better filters eg ground-floor master suite Obnoxious ""give me your email address"" at every turn Uninstalled | wanderful | It's pretty easy to use. I like exploring possible new places to retire to. | Now you are sending me notifications on things I have already saved? Why are you sending me notifications on houses that I have hidden? The app also shows notifications; however, when I click on it, there is nothing showing in the app? I then try clicking on the updates icon; however, nothing is showing which homes actually have updates? App needs a lot of work. | They were so helpful taking down pictures of my property that I just bought & they even left me additional information for me about keeping my home privacy safe. Thank you | Great web. site to advertise your home, or land for sale. I have sold and bought homes with the help from Zillow! I recommend using this site, it is easy to use, and a great way to advertise. | App has alot of issues and bugs ,very difficult to deal with sometimes also they post homes that are already sold wasting your time and getting hopes up for nothing | Good app, I wish they displayed information about whether homes met certain loan requirements. | I have just found you but hopefully we can work together! | Needs a community commenting or social section | enjoying all the beautiful styles of home I have been receiving. | It's easy to navigate. | Why do you need my email if I just want to browse? I can use your website without this caveat. Get a grip | I don't like to have to sign in to see homes People like to look, and if I see something interesting I'm calling or texting. Most people would, so the challenge we have is keeping more than one agent from calling. I dont bother with sites that require my personal contact information. Give the number and the agents start calling. So annoying and time consuming. | Latest 2 or 3 releases introduced an incredibly annoying bug. Deep linking into the app from Zillow emails will load the listing but snap back to prior search/map. Please fix this. | Super glitches don't download | Found my home years ago | It requires me to login inorde to unsubscribe mail. | There is something for everyone trust ..!!!! | Great Website Very Helpful ! | It's easier to browse the website than the app. After opening a house entry to view details, when I press the back arrow to return to the search list, it takes me to the TOP of the list and I have to scroll ALL the way back down to where I was. Super annoying. With the web browser, I can at least open up new tabs so I keep my place in the list. I just deleted the app to use the website instead. | outstanding site. | I am really enjoying what I am seeing on here. thank you | This app stops working. It always goes back to the last home you viewed instead of the home you just requested to view. To add to that the prices are screwed up. In a list view it shows one price, but in the actual listing itself it shows a much higher price. | The new update is awful. | You show my house on the market for over 200 days, but we just went on last Thursday, 5 days ago. This is hurting us. Many upgrades have been made since we were briefly on the market last year. Please change it to the correct number. Only 2 people came to our open house opening weekend! | Clicking a house link from a Zillow email opens the house in the app, but it doesn't check if that house is on the dislike list. I tried this several times, and despite tapping dislike each time, it never loaded with the dislike button highlighted. Seems small but it creates confusion and wastes time. Would be nice to be able to filter out septic and well too. | Good | Bugs, old listing and scams | Good | Freezes 🙄 | It's zillow. Nothing special. | When I set up search filters, I rarely get any results. But searching WITHOUT filters, I see many that have all my filter criteria. I WISH YOU WOULD FIX THAT | We found a great home | When I select a house then click the back button to go to my search results, instead of staying on the page I selected from say 3 of 5, it will go back to 1 of 3. | The only bad thing I have to say is that they keep sending me to homes with a HOA $. | NOTIFICATION CONSTANTLY JESUS F'ING CHRIST GIVE IT A REST | it's easy to look at home for Buyer. | I'm trying to make adjustments to the cost and taxes of a home and your app glitches. Your app is broken. Fix it. | The Zestimate is a useless algorithm. Even ignoring the factors Zillow can't know, it gives often absurd values. It took me several years to remove rental photos from public view because their website is so terrible. | I have never experienced a more frustrating app than this one. Why can't I view messages I've sent or received? Why aren't properties I've contacted tracked? Why is it sometimes I hit the back button and it goes back, and sometimes I hit it and it closes the app? This is the last movie I ever use Zillow for. There's too many better options that actually care about user experiences. | They are scammers the whole app is a scam .. | The best | Out of all the rental apps this is by far the worse. Can't even bree your own messages with people. Have to jump through hoops to see messages........ | Cannot find anywhere to get rid of a location I don't want to look at anymore. | Either the filters aren't working or companies aren't adhering to them. IE When I select ""allows large dogs"" and then the rentals pop up listing every large dog under breed restrictions. Or when looking to buy and you set the HOA at $500 but they're just going to ignore that completely. | Filters seem to be non-functional at times. This renders the app somewhere between a huge time requirement and useless. Otherwise easy to use. | The app has been displaying the incorrect home status for saved homes for months. | When you click ""hide a home"" the home comes right back up in the search results. Not really possible to narrow down on a handful of homes within a filter. Seems like a bug in the app that could easily be fixed. | I just like looking at different house and layouts | This app is just a joke, nothing works and if you call Zillow for help, there's no way you can actually talk to a real person. | Long-Standing customer exceptional site | Useless | so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Awesome home seeking app | Non-existent Although I've reached out repeatedly to 3 different agents. Very disappointed, very, very disappointed. | Won't verify listing even though I've gotten messages from 4 different people claiming to work for Zillow. I send a verification code and they say the phone does not work. Then when the listing does come up, it is in the totally wrong area. Total joke. | App no longer allow you to do a simple 'list' of sold homes when doing a search of sn area. App used to be great, now just plain awful. | If you enjoy clicking for no purpose whatsoever, This app is for yo | The app used to be great, but since the last update on the 28th of March 2024, it stopped loading information and updating the information on homes saved to show when they go under contract or price changes. | User friendly, accurate, informative. | I can't cancel searches I no longer want. | Serious landlord ghosting problem on Zillow. Landlords don't respond after paying $35 for the Zillow application. It's fine for Zillow to not be in control of them, but landlords who don't respond to applications should lose access to the service. It doesn't work to have a service full of non-responsive rental listings. | This app does not display enough useful information the filter settings do not work every time I try to set up to hide 55 plus communities .","{""1"":14172,""2"":6227,""3"":40464,""4"":186850,""5"":947823}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Zillow","9009299467586107971","androidfeedback@zillow.com","http://www.zillow.com/android","1301 Second Avenue, Floor 31,

And I can see weather in real time anywhere | You MUST watch the excellent videos of world weather ! Your local weather forecast is spot on, up to the minute, accurate, AND easy to decipher. A++ !! | Phenomenal, the station keeps my family up to date. | good but not accurate | good weather channel | Still working it out | I can't even get this ------ to open!!!I've allowed every permission but my bank account and cc number I have had it!!! | Of 3 apps I have, this is the best radar! | The weather on my samsung phone comes from the weather channel. The data is garbage. As we speak the phone says it's raining. Guess what it's not. Remember back in the 70s when the weather used to be accurate? Today's radar sucks. | Doesn't work right | wrong temperature | Entirely too many ads and for whatever reason there is an option to subscribe to a premium option to access basic parts of the app? I already hate the subscription based model for such a basic service as knowing the weather but it would at least be worth it if the app was close to accurate but it is wrong constantly, I understand the weather changes but seriously I can't rely on this app at all for accurate weather reports | Describe Your Experience | Grea ,lt for checking the w,& 9eather on the go. | The ads are ridiculous, always has issues loading, have to force close and reload, very slow loading | How do I place on my home screen so I don't have to open the app | inaccurate 85% of the time | Just started using. Looks like a great app. Home screen has very concise info. | easy quick and reliable look at the weather in my area and surrounding areas. | too much ads | Good | it's a great app | App keeps getting rid of my icon and can not seem to get the phone right either | love the weather details it offers | better predictions than the local weather stations! | Exlent | More ads than information! Terrible! | GOOD 😃😊 | lots of adds | I do not like the new detail. I liked being Able to look at an hour and see temperature Chance of rain and wind all in one Line, not having to open another screen. | Full screen ads on top of banner ads. Uninstalled and will never use again. | Why do the Freeze & river Flood warnings keep repeating even though they don't change? Why do the high/low temps in the Today Hourly forecast rarely match those in the Daily forecast? The Real-time Rain alerts used to consistently alert me amazingly accurately within 30 minutes before the rain started - a couple years ago. Now in 2023 they always occur after the rain starts or falsely before no rain falls. | It's good but I would like the home/default menu to be the radar because it says it's a 'radar' | More adds than an add agency | The best and truly precise weather app. Thanks. | Inaccurate!!!! | ADS = Slows down experience Unoptimized | Congrats on commoditizing the weather to the point where there's too many ads for the app to function. More ads space on my screen than weather information. Why do I need to be sold something to check the temperature? | Very informative, helpful and useful! | great forcast accuracy | I love the app but am not overly fond of where they placed the ads and I don't want to pay for premium. | Now that they've stopped using (fired?) the apps personalities the videos stink. You can't watch the weathervevents and read the descriptions. The hosts added a lot and this AI/cost cutting now has me sear hing for a new app. I'm gone as soon as I find a replacement. Sale from IBM to some hedge fund killed it. | Won't work installed and uninstalled twice. Won't run on Android | l appreciate the option of this app. Video's also gives insight regarding more than weather. the information for 954 and behind my neighbors' homes is 561, the Atlantic Ocean inlet intercoastal running access between both counties. The application has lots of ads that you wouldn't expect This dulls the reading part. I am wowed. no FB, no I, no X news streaming. 😔 that is great. imagine storming and a stones throw away no rain at all. Paradise 2024, launch your water kraft. | You guys are cool | it's okay | Despite having all notifications turned off (other than through phone notification settings) the app still pushes general notifications not associated with weather alerts or emergencies, the ""you might be interested"" type of notifications. Pretty annoying. Considering Uninstalling based on the number of annoying irrelevant notifications. I expected more from TWC. App doesn't adhere to notification settings from within the app. | It's been very dependable in my area, good app. | good | Way to many ads. | good reviews | The locals are non functional most of the time and had to download another App to get my daily weather for my Job site reports. Unhappy and disappointed. | Never accurate | good app | It is vital to understand the weather as well as the good and bad that accompanies it. The Weather Channel is my ""GO TO"" app to keep me apprised and knowledgeable!👍 | good | love it | too confusing and too much fake news! | Updated review. Better than my previous review. The app isn't as bad and the info is very useful. But like many weather apps, the widgets are useless. | good | great app works anywhere on the planet | App is never accurate and is crammed full of ads!!! | good | Great forecasting and interesting stories/videos!! | I like the way it set up | Can't figure out why this is the only app on my phone that's super-slow / locks up... | 💕 | Weather at my finger tips !! | good aapp | Full page ads appear when pressing the back button?!!. Very intrusive and disruptive. Forces me to close the app to stop them | good | The Weather Channel is the gold standard for accuracy | You are better than the local weather. You are more accurate which makes it easy to plan the day. Great job | It's wrong 90% of the time and there are adds popping up while I'm trying to get the weather. The app that came with my new phone is way better. | Love the weather channel on TV ,so why not on my phone . | very reliable | I can't get the information the majority of the time | Good | Imperative to have access to perfect weather broadcasting. | Works good always showing what is going on | I like it because i can go onto my app and see what the weather is going to be like when I go to work or when the greatgrand kids come over ! We can do something outside. And when it is time to plant veggies and new flowers 💐,. And sit outside and smell the fresh air! | too many ads 🙄 | excellent in the weather | coolio | Not very accurate about rain forecasts | Don't know what happened don't get any reading and location was not correct.couldnt Bring in weather. So I deleted you | Right now it isn't working Been stuck on 3 days ago | Cant open it. | Bought this app because it seemed the most accurate but lately, it's completely inaccurate. | Here's your review you wanted so badly | Okay. | This app doesn't seem to be compatible with Android Auto as some have said. Will it be in the future? | So much junk! | It's what I base my whole week around. I find you very dependable. .Thank You!!! | I like the accuracy for the next day, and also I enjoy the weather stories 😊 | I love the weather ☁️🌡️ channel app it's my go too weather forecast grew watching this channel 😀 | I downloaded this app about 2 years ago. It has been great until you added you added MapBox. Now when you go to the radar page, it has a red overlay on it. Please take it away or add a way to remove it on the app. This is maddening! | Ads hijack the operation of the apk. Difficult exiting. | I just uninstalled mines. Used to be best App, till suddenly the temp stop showing on homepage. Uninstalled/installed again & still won't work. Why idk but now I have to find another one that works😶!! | Great Awesome App Right On Point","{""1"":66766,""2"":28192,""3"":111488,""4"":462878,""5"":2366779}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.99 - $29.99 per item","7.0","7.0","VARY","The Weather Channel","5938833519207566184","android.support@weather.com","https://weather.com/","1001 Summit Blvd

I can't even find HOW to find the present price. | Good resource, and very good discounts. | Big savings, thank you | literally a lifesaver. no way I can afford these medications without insurance. I've had one cvs pharmacy refuse to honor GoodRX coupon, but a different cvs about a mile away has honored your GoodRX coupon, no questions asked. I felt that to be very odd. I simply expressed my gratitude to the cooperating pharmacist & his response was a simple ""your welcome."" again, a very sincere thank you, GoodRX. | Fast and informative. Easy to use | Wonderful having a program that helps us out. | Great prices | 7+ years using GoodRX and still loving it! | Very good! | I've saved several hundreds over the years and I am very grateful for this app. I've even tried mail order and the price didn't come close to GOOD RX. | I've been using for about 3 months now and have already saved over $1,000.00.. amazing. Thanks Good Rx | Save a lot of money! | Prices aren't always accurate | I like the rewards part and try to stay engaged in it for free gift cards to 100's of locations!! | Great | Cool app | I subscribed to what I thought was the family plan since I pay for my wife's meds. The pharmacy says because it isn't my wife as the main account holder I don't get the discount. I contacted good rx and they said I didn't add her (no instructions to do so regardless) and they offered no solution cept to eat the 40 extra dollars to get her antibiotics. The app constantly changed my pharmacy, made it hard to cancel my subscription like most of these scams. The app and program is a fail | Awesome | Always gives me best price Compares pharmacies | Great savings | Definitely a money saver! | I recently started using a continuous glucose monitor. Since I'm a type 2 and not using insulin my insurance wouldn't pay for it. The first time I paid around $160 for a 28-day supply. The second time I found a coupon on GoodRx which said it was for $5 off. Well I thought better than nothing. When I used the coupon at the Walmart pharmacy I go to I was pleasantly shocked they were only charging me $85. Just this one experience makes app worth my time. Certainly wouldn't hurt to give it a try! | Great savings on most prescriptions, but Kroger and Walmart do not honor good rx coupons for pain medications that are controlled substances. | Money saver | Easy to use | Saving $$ is always a good perk | Better prices | I am very happy with GoodRx and enjoying savings. | Send me codes then said it was not right | Great app | Helps with my medicine | good prices | Helps you keep more of your money. Wonderful coupons and discounts on medicines at many drugstores. Easy to use. I love thisuch needed app. | Has helped save $$$ | Wonderful | Easy, comprehensive, valuable.

Makes doing chores enjoyable | Very entertaining | So I have always loved this app but I can see a trend in the comments for the last week that people are having the same issue I am of the app not even opening. I have tried clearing cache and data, uninstalling and restarting my phone to no avail. The most frustrating thing is audible customer service is not even acknowledging this issue. Yeah if u call they'll give you a free credit but what good does that do if I can't open the app | Audible has increasingly adopted the habit of using the preface of the book as the 'sample', including any piece of music therein; however long. The result is oftentimes an entirely different voice actor is reading the actual book, so I've no idea if I'll enjoy the reading. It's a tiresome practice so I buy fewer books from them. I plenty in my library already that I can't bear/ get through. | Its makes reading very easy. | Suddenly the audible app wont open. This sux! | Very difficult to cancel subscription | App works for me. However, the sleep timer is unreliable and the power consumption in paused state seems to be too high. Please fix. | I wrote the following review 10 years ago. I'm still using the app regularly. It works great with Android Auto. I'm now using it for podcasts too. The Audible app just works. I use my phone exclusively for listening now because of the mobility and reliability. I don't really think about the app. It just works. | Won't open, bug detected, force close. Galaxy A somthing android | Crashes and is not usable | Won't stay open, total done and cancelled my membership. Not paying for something I can't use. | 5 star ordinarily but hasn't been functional for well over a week now. Doesn't even start, just instantly crashes. I'll restore 5 stars when it's working again! | love it.. but I need a break..impossible to cancel it!!! please assist with this! | Great books but app glitches alot. | App does not work, opens and immediately crashes | My app does not work. I push it, and it closes. I can not listen to it in my car and it's so frustrating | This app is in desperate need of an update to fix whatever bug is causing it to crash. I have used this app for years and have never had an issue until now. It's been over a week, and every time I try to open the app, it crashes. I've tried to uninstall and reinstall several times, tried rebooting my phone, and tried talking to customer service. They are very nice, but unfortunately it hasn't fixed the problem. Please fix this so I can use my app again, then I will update my rating. | Love app | Many problems to sign in | I really like this app, but it could be improved if they added a ""stop at end of chapter"" option. | Best app ever to read along with!! Or just listen on the go if you song have time to crack a book! Or just plain listening I do it all the time before bed or during a walk!!! | Amazing app for audiobooks. I have been using audible for years and have had zero issues | Why am I not able to buy anything? I spent 1 credit on a book and it didn't even come in my library And I am not able to buy any book as a premium plus member | Like many others, I'm experiencing a glitch where the app crashes non-stop | Will NOT OPEN!!!! | Easy to use. | Glass of wine outside | Not user friendly - all I wanted to do was redeem a code for a book and there is no place on the app. When you make it this hard I won't use it | Exceptional | So buggy! Multiple times per week, Audible loses my place in a book and starts me at the beginning. Also, Audible is so buggy with Android Auto. Other apps seem to work fine in Android auto. Audible used to be better all around, but it's gotten more buggy over time. Such a bummer. | The app worked wonderfully up until a week ago. Now, the app crashes within seconds of opening it. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not fix the issue. | Love it! Great when I need something to get through the day. | Crashed and can't be fixed.6 days now. | I don't like it right now cause it has a big and It want let in the app | This app has a great selection of books to listen to, including goosebumps books and classic books. | The books I purchased disappeared from my account after the app crashed for days, it is overpriced the customer service is terrible, I would not recommend this app or company to anymore. Highly disappointed after years of using the app and I will be searching for better service in the future. Overall the monopoly needs to be broken im sick of being at the mercy of big companies like this when all I'm trying to do is sharpen what I know about the world. | Great app loads of titles to choose from | This is my favourite App for books.I have been a user for years (and I mean YEARS!) | I haveoved and listened to my stories and podcasts for hear with no issues. Now all the sudden the app won't stay in in my android phone.it works on everything else but my phone. I have to log in using the Internet browser instead. It's a terrible work around and not getting any help with the issue. Troubleshooting and restarting and reinstalling does not work for this issue. | Excellent | You can't open your wishlist on the mobile app | Cannot resubscribe. Had my subscription set up on Google. Cancelled last year and now trying to set it up again. I cannot as there seem to be issues. I called Audible, who told me to call Google. I called Google, who told me to call Audible. I called Audible again who told me to call Google. It also displays the string ""Your membership ends on %cancellation_date%"". I tried getting Audible support to submit a bug about it, but they left the chat. Now I cannot pay. | I really enjoy being able to have my hands free. I read every chance I can. Audiobooks are the best. | My app immediately stops..... help | 👍 | Customer support is absolutely atrocious | Stops frequently for no reason. | Since audibles fastest update it will not work on my phone, I have been a loyal customer who purchases all the time. Over 600 titles in my library and NOTHING, the ap crashes every time a and 4 days ago support told be 24 hours and 2 days ago you told me 48 hours. I am being forced to check into getting a new phone just to use your app, what kind of compensation are you giving for thus issue | It's great so far in the second month! | Really makes long and monotonous days at work, or even the daily commute bearable | Great reading material, for the young and old. | It's crashed since yesterday. I've done everything to get it working without success | I have the Audible+ subscription, which allows access to a library of free books in addition to the new releases offered for a price or credits. It takes seconds to download a book. There is a great selection of titles. | Love Audible but it's been crashing every time I open it the past week. I've done what the app suggests to fix it, but it's still not working. Please fix this! | Can't even open the app. It just keeps shutting down right when I open it. | The system has been down over a week and still no explanation or estimated time for service. | DAY FOUR of updating this one-star review until the app is fixed. Going into the Listening Time menu causes the app to crash and has been doing so for more than a year. | Great app | Listening to books during work helps keep me focused. | So nice to listen while in traffic. | Love it wouldn't be with out it,so many books all in one place Love the fact that audible tagged in too,if I had all the physical books I'd have to have my own library | My favorite audiobook app! | Böøk | I truly enjoyed the experience. | Best way to listen to your favorite books and just get lost in the words!!!!! | Still there is a bug with Audible please fix!!! The app keeps shutting down. My phone says it's a bug with the app in the developer needs to fix it. I have unused credits on the app | Best app ever! | As someone with Adhd, I find it helps tremendously with my ability to finish novels. I love this app. The subscription price is worth it. | Great alternative to endlessly searching for radio stations on long trips. | Great book available I love that I can get books that just hit the shelves | I haven't been able to use the app for over a week now. It crashes immediately upon opening it. I've tried clearing the cache/the data, reinstalling multiple times, nothing has worked. | Awesome app great content ! | Won't open | Use it on break during work so I can eat and listen really nice. Can even download books for later depending on if I have a good connection at the job site. | Constantly stops playing for no reason when I leave the app. So annoying. Also constantly has issues downloading podcast episodes. | I 💚 THIS APP!!! I love books!! I own a ton of them but it's not always practical to travel with them. Enter AUDIBLE. Now I can still have my favorite titles with me and I can also discover new titles in different genres. This app is also a lifesaver on those days when I can't fall asleep. I put on my sleep mask, turn on a good book and let the app do the rest. It reminds me of when my children were small and I read them bedtime stories only now I get them read to me!! Thanks AUDIBLE!! | great collection of books | Good choice of audiobooks and easy to navigate | Really enjoy this app | Ease driving tines | I have audible on 2 devices. It worked fine on both for a while. One still is fine, but my newer A54 Galaxy will not open the app. Says contact developer. | After getting two audiobooks your app keeps closing when I open it | Walmart 0.88 and a a thing about: | Great app, easy to use | Excellent, for people with dyslexia or have bad eye sight, or just like listening to unabridged books, or playes this is an invaluable resource | Maximize your time!! In this busy world, where we have sometimes have long drives, lots of dishes laundry gardening, or are our eyes get super tired, it's super nice to be able to consume content while either doing something else or just chilling out. I have actually used it to fall asleep to. Sometimes the muffled voice of the reader through my earbuds helped me fall asleep. Just make sure to find out what chapter you're in so you can back up because you might just finish the book overnight. | I'm surprised how much I'm loving this app! I've been flying through audio books. It gives me something to listen to while I'm working around the house and walking. I actually find myself doing more activity so I can keep listening. | Very well made recordings and easy to use app | App works well most of the time. But can someone explain to me how the hell a downloaded book can seemingly lag? Audible has long had this issue, audio just getting blurbed every now and then at random. | not releasing books on the date they are set to be released is ridiculous. I'm going back to Google books | Loved it | Roll back whatever update is causing the app to be non-functional. Considering this problem has existed for more than a week it is unlikely I'll be updating this review. An update causing the app to crash on opening should of been fixed within a few days or the update rolled back. The fact that neither option has been taken and that no helpful info has been added to the help section is disappointing. | Nothing like actually holding a book in your hands but this is the next best thing😊 | Best way to enjoy books on the go! | I've been using audible for years, and just recently it keeps crashing. It's frustrating because I've put sooo much money into it, I'll have to unsubscribe if this keeps happening. | Audible is great, I never thought a subscription would be worth it, but as soon as I actually started listening I have spend all of my time listening to new book. The reviews are also super helpful when looking for a new book. One improvement I hope to see in the future is the ability to upvote or react to other reviews so that people can see what reviews people tend to agree with most often. | I love audiobook | App either crashes, randomly skips ahead, or pauses after updating to the latest version. Other than that, searching for books is convoluted and cumbersome. More filters and search features should be added. | 👌 wow superb...🙂🙂","{""1"":84489,""2"":29608,""3"":37049,""4"":152477,""5"":1272338}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.49 - $279.99 per item","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Audible, Inc.","5727193613985759060","customersupport@audible.com","https://www.audible.com","1 Washington Pl Ste 1600

But it's fairly easy to use when it does work, and its one of the better fast food apps. The coupons used to be better | It will not allow me to change store location. I would not give me a refund. Customer support doesn't exist. | They made it to where u can't use any coupons. If u want to take ur family to burger king it'll cost u $45 because they only allow one coupon per 24 hr period. What a way to get me to stop coming here. | works well and makes getting food easy | Cloud game wouldn't load. | great deals and rewards | Very dependable and fast. And good food. | hoping for free points with this review | Terrible app, when I go to log in I need to provide a confirmation code that is sent to my email. I don't have email access on my phone to have to get a code. No other fast food app has this. Why not send a code to my cell phone # ? I deleted the app because it's more of a hassle than ease of use | I wish there was a large sweet tea option when trying to get a meal. | double-checked my name and I was still given the wrong order. | I have quite a few issues of this app. I love the app for it's deals, but the new option of customer support is terrible. Automatic customer support doesn't work properly. It gets stuck at the beginning checking over order and the receipt picture crashes the whole thing to start over. I been trying to report a salmonella issue to make sure it gets checked over since I enjoy the burgers in burger king the most than any other place. I wish there was some other way to report. | it doesn't give me a code after I order online | order is always delayed better ordering at the store | Great, Occasional Deals, and points, that Could be Way Better, when you order stuff. The App works, just Burger King is So Damn Stingy with what they offer. And my neighborhood BK is Terrible. Orders are Always Wrong and Cold. | everything I order something, yall ain't got all of what I ordered, no cookies no oreos to go in the shake | At first this app was a huge convenience, but sadly that has all changed. In recent months the app either won't load or it loads and doesn't display the offers anymore. Or worse, it says that certain items are not available. Definitely thinking about deleting it and sticking with McDonald's app. | very good app | Girl at window was not in a good mood. | good food | Excellent service and convenient. | Great deals and free food. I like the app | for far no mess ups in my orders | awesome | great service | This is a helpful app | Would not allow me to create an account, or sign in with a pre existing one. I contacted support to report the issue, received no actual support for four days, and then got a ""how would you rate the support you received?"" email. App is non functional, support is non existent. | Try to use the app to order breakfast at 6 in the morning and it won't even bring up the breakfast menu. Bring up prior breakfast orders and it says only available at breakfast time. It's 6 in the morning last time I checked that was breakfast time | The food was good, but the store has cheated me many times in the last four years! DO NOT PULL AWAY FROM THE WINDOW WITHOUT CHECKING FIRST TO SEE THAT YOU GOT WHAT YOU ORDERED!! 1186 Perimeter Drive, Cleveland, TN, will charge you for food and not give it to you! They're stealing from their customers!! | it's burger king | No Food At Restaurant! Ordered online, store didn't have my order and didn't do anything to help fix it. Worthless. Interesting that I got a reply here before I got a refund or call back from the customer service. Priorities... | great customer service.Thank you | App does not allow you to customize a whopper offer. It offers an impossible or regular whopper for $3 on Wednesdays but doesn't allow you to choose regular or impossible or customize toppings. I want to do it on the app so I don't have to go into the store, tho store ppl are very nice. Would be a 4 or 5 otherwise. | forget burger in order | great food and service--app is so easy to use | Excellent process... | This app is really easy to use and navigate. | This is the best BK location, they made my 9 year old sons trip such a wonderful experience! Thank you for being so great! | Coupons don't work. | Decent app, could be designed differently for better experience. | Not actually all that user friendly | last week my app stopped working and I lost 950 points! I had to start a new account....that stinks! | Garbage app. They don't make your order until you confirm it at the drive-through, so what's the point of the app? The deals? Not even because the coupons I get in the mailbox are always superior to the app deals. | simple, fast, and not crashing is the best for food order app. | The staff at the Patchogue Waverly location are so friendly! And my order is always right. | OK 👍 | convenient and easy to use. nice that it doesn't need a constant connection to location, as some of us just aren't that big on that feature. | Drink options... Coke and... Diet Coke... That's it... My brother in Christ, there's a Freestyle machine at this location, there should be literally hundreds of drink options | The functionality seemed fine. The issue I had was mainly with the customer support side. I placed a $50 order for the family. When I got to the restaurant they told me they had no buns and were cancelling my order. Gave me a receipt that said overring and told me I would receive my money back. I did not receive money back. I contacted support they said they would reach out in 48 hours. They did not reach out. Went back to the restaurant for the refund and got the run around. | My delivery orders are messed up about 60% of the time. Missing items, incorrect items, incorrect customizations, no dipping sauces, cold food. If there's a way to screw up an order, Burger King will find it. If I want to gamble, I'll go to Vegas. If I'm hungry, I'm going anywhere except the BK app. | only one person working, very polite though | I love it | So far so good | I love Texas double burger | Always on time just sometimes I get The right stuff | Would never sign in. Took my info but would never work. I get emails from it but the app just resets and never signs in. | very easy to use | Remember back when BK""s slogan was ""Have it your way""? Those were good times.. All I wanted to know was how to request a drink with no ice. I tried to contact someone through the app but I can only get the ai. And since I have not actually placed an order yet, I can't get past it to talk to a real human. I just want a Dr Pepper with no ice. That is all. I'm getting frustrated. I cannot figure out how to contact a human being through the app. | This app works about half of the time. Sometimes it won't let me log in, Sometimes it can't find a local burger king, I've ordered from dozens of times. Sometimes it works great! But it's the half of the time it doesn't work I'm giving 2 stars for. | I really like the fast service and the food is very good. | service is fast and food is hot and fresh | ""Dread Rico"" Likes DeLicious Burger King | great place to eat | Awesome great | very convenient to play mobile orders for grabbing a quick meal on a lunch break. | I need my mcdonald's again back to me, but from Texas, no, no from California...... thank you. | I opened this restaurant app to order food and there was a popup to play their mobile video game and I closed the app and threw some tater tots in the air fryer. | Love the Whoppers, on line games, to win Prizes! keep it hot ,fresh burgers ,and fries 😋 ,I want it my way !! 🤗lol thanks,! bk | Love Burger King and the Burger King app!! | I love burger King 👑 | Did nobody test the game? | This app is GREAT!!! Easy to use | Good | So, crowns expire now? What a coincidence, so did my decision to eat at Burger King today. There's no rewards program worse than one that shackles you to the company and steals your earned points back if you don't use them at the company's pleasure. There is way too much competition out there to overlook this customer-spiting behavior, so I'm going to buy my lunch at a restaurant that respects its customers. | Poor. It takes too long to get code to order breakfast. Ad popups denying me code unless I install updates on my phone. | Quick friendly service, fresh food. | other establishments are running a inferior program for compensation and loyalty rewards truly greatful for such experiences | Burger bun was stale and cold. | The customer support function doesn't even work, I tried to click the items they got wrong and click submit, and it does nothing. Great customer support feature. | Always have trouble using app. Employees have to ask managers. Managers complain that it's too hard to use. And all for a 5% discount, if that! Not worth the hassle! | great deals.. best rewards App | the place is lit | I like the bk app and their spicy wrap is good 👍 yum! | great app crowns rewards are the bonb | Menu not Refreshing. Cannot redeem deals as well | Every time I come and order anything with bacon on it, yall be forgetting the bacon | What happened to the loyalty upgrade for drinks and fries? | Go inside for breakfast & use the app for discounts | great!!! | the deals... | Downloaded this app to help save money. The menu is never right. When it's breakfast time it shows lunch menu. Tried a couple times. Save your time just don't even use the app if you're craving the king | 6 l th u Should u | Does not show dine in | It could be higher, but they are stingy with the royal crowns unless I am feeding a family of three or four times a week at Burger King. It will take a while to even get a Whopper. | had to wait over 20 minutes for my food which I get there was a crazy rush on 4/20, but I had to go in multiple times because I didn't get everything and I even pre-ordered as well. there was no straw, no extra onions, I was missing a small fry and didn't have sauce for my chicken fries 😢 I was hungry and in a rush | Delicious | love ordering with the app so I never miss out on the best deals","{""1"":30421,""2"":6623,""3"":11405,""4"":31805,""5"":190700}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Burger King, Inc.","Burger+King,+Inc.","support@burgerking.zendesk.com","https://www.bk.com","5707 Blue Lagoon Dr

Update; it could be me but I don't find navigation the simplest. I couldn't find a way to stop overlays from this app even though I used the slider for it. I also don't like that the blocked caller can still leave a message. I like the idea of this but found it to be invasive in undesirable ways.

Edit: Agora consigo pagar boletos no mesmo dia. Merecidas 5 estrelas, o serviço é ótimo, transparente e a UI (User Interface) do aplicativo é impecável. | Its Great and easy! | DON'T! | Excelente banco. | ótimo banco virtual, com mtts opções de uso, 5 estrelas | The ad said there would be money for opening an account. I have received no money or any instructions on how to access money promised in the ad. | Who put this on here | Só problemas. Sempre!!! Não presta. Irei processá-los. | App mal organizado, com interface poluída, e que faz uso exagerado de pop-ups. A remoção do cashback direto, e redução da quantidade de cashback em si, são outros dois pontos negativos. Não recomendo o Inter somente pelo aplicativo ser tão ruim. | Cool | Sempre trazendo melhorias! Ótimo aplicativo e ótimos serviços do banco, após anos como cliente nunca tive nenhum problema! | Olá quero informar que após algum tempo em contato com a equipe do banco Inter a equipe resolveu o problema. fizeram uma grande melhoria no sistema de recadastro de selfie e finalmente consegui recadastrar no aparelho novo muito obrigado a todos da equipe do banco Inter. | Estou simplesmente adorando a experiência, aplicativo fluído, sem travamentos, rápido, bonito. Estou migrando minha conta do roxinho pra cá sem arrependimentos, fora que a conta PJ é sensacional, boleto com PIX, cai no mesmo dia, isso me ajudou tanto que vcs não têm ideia! Parabéns! | Excelente banco digital. Só poderia ser mais intuitivo e pedir senha quando for realizada uma transferência (para o usuário ter maior sensação de segurança). | Péssimo, não instalem!!!! | AWESOME!!! THANK YOU!! BOUT X | Muito bom | Danos are forming my life | O aplicativo é muito prático, responsivo e bonito. O banco (como só uso para o básico, pix e cartão), me parece ser confiável e seguro. Mas acredito que podia haver mais auxílios/dicas de como gerenciar uma conta bancária. Só atualizar os termos de uso e pedir para concordar, dificulta o entendimento do que mudou. Talvez um pouco de tutorial cairia bem :] | o app tem evoluido muito, mas as parte q sao web ainda é bem ruim | Não consigo usar o dinheiro na conta, a função débito está bloqueado, vou mudar de banco depois disso. | Não eh intuitivo nao funciona corretamente. Eu nunca vi um banco falar que a senha é fraca por ter mais de 15 caracteres e pior deixar você registrar para depois falar que o login e senha estão errados e fazer todo um processo de modificação de senha que demora horas porque o sistema de mandar mensagem por sms eh lento. E para finalizar não me perguntaram meu número de telefone quando fui alterar me fizeram modificar todos os documentos e email. Nao consegui nem logar na conta. | topper | O aplicativo é ótimo, mas cade a opção de baixar o comprovante? Para compartilhar tenho que obrigatoriamente enviar para alguém isso é meio chato | Ótimo aplicativo!! Deixando aqui uma sugestão: implementem, por fvr a funcionalidade de caixinhas pra separarmos o dinheiro por categoria todos os meses. Vai ser muitíssimo útil! Obg 🧡 | its a app good, she is quick, easy and dinamic | Atualizei o app e fiquei sem a opção de digitar a minha senha para entrar na conta. Avisa erro de conexão e depois algo errado aconteceu em loop. Não aparece o box de input. Logo, não consigo acessar a minha conta. Att, Oi, eu não quero ser atendido. Quero o acesso a minha conta. Começou o Itaú? O que a minha conexão de internet (que é estável e funciona bem em todos os outros aparelhos) precisa ser testada com Telemetria? Estou sem acesso e sem entender. | App demora muito para atualizar a fatura do cartão de crédito | No good zain service good asking ke bill | Uma estrela até ter modo escuro | Ad auto installs this app. Spam behavior. | Meu aplicativo está dando erro ao entrar como se eu estivesse sem Internet, todos os meus aplicativos com acesso a Internet estão funcionando normalmente menos esse. | Great | Nobody will show me a picture of a 2015 Honda SUV | Good | perfeito e maravilhoso | Não consigo ver o meu extrato e nem utilizar nada da minha conta | This app is a scam. There are ads floating around advertized on news apps saying if I download Inter&Co: Financial APP and create an account I can earn $1000.00 no deposit. Stop advertizing lies, because there is always a catch | Não gosto da demora no processamento das compras no cartão de crédito e na atualização do valor gasto no crédito. A gente coloca dinheiro na conta pra antecipar a fatura demora a atualizar e parece que não abate nada. Quando vai ver sempre fica o Valor alto é muito estranho. O app em si é bonitinho Mas eu desisto conselho fazer apenas uma compra no crédito pra acompanhar se não vc se perde. | Nice. | até pouco tempo atrás tinha a opção de ""histórico"" (ou algo assim) na Global para visualizar os dividendos pagos, mas sumiu. ou mudaram de lugar? | Minha conversa no chat foi encerrada enquanto eu digitava uma pergunta. Outra coisa que atrapalha são as notificações no meio do chat fazendo com que a janela feche, e tem que abrir o chat novamente, perdendo as informações que já haviam sido digitadas. Filtro de investimentos poderia ser incluído 'taxa de rentabilidade' para facilitar a busca por taxa. | Edit: A central deste banco chega a ser uma piada de mal gosto, nem da para chamar de atendimento, não tem empatia nenhuma com o cliente e não parecem conhecer o produto para qual trabalham, e menos ainda de varejo, em uma ligação no passado, quando questionei sobre o Open Finance, o atendente não sabia do que se tratava rsrs, já no que aconteceu mais recentemente, foi pior, a ponto de eu desligar na cara do atendente, mesmo eu repetindo várias vezes, atendimento do Itaú da de 10 a 0. | Muito bom o app e o banco,mas ta faltando uma coisa: Ter opção de pix no crédito. | Bug na interface de cartões. | No one speaks English | é bom | I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS | Get my money 💰 | Não gostei da atualização de senha COD.BL09 que apareceu após eu efetuar um pagamento PIX, maior burocracia para conseguir cadastrar nova senha. Deveria ser somente um aviso para atualizar a senha, não bloquear o acesso da conta. Se continuar com isso, vou procurar outro banco digital. | Cuidado, a app bloqueia o seu acesso às suas contas para coletar sua biometria facial. A obrigação de coletar a biometria facial é contra a lei no Rio de Janeiro. Sou cliente há 5 anos e estou decepcionado. O perfil pode ser usado pelo banco para bloquear uma pessoa de confiança usando sua conta ou você mesmo depois de sofrer acidente que tenha deformado o rosto, ou fazer tatuagem etc. | Eu tô vacilando ou toda vez que tento fazer um Ted o app realiza um pix | Thumbs 👍 | É um bom banco, mas uma péssima corretora. O preço médio de todas as minhas ações estão errados, | Suporte péssimo, não conseguem nem verificar histórico de casos passado. Trabalhei 2 anos como suporte e sei que eles não tem desculpa nenhuma para ser tão incompetentes. Fora isso que o app não paraaaa de ficar enviando ads para o usuário, muito irritante. | 👍 | app inoportuno fica pedindo pra avaliar toda hr | Melhor banco de todos | Not for everyone | Horrível!! Toda vez que vc precisa usar o banco vc nem que refazer todo o cadastro de novo. Se vc precisar fazer um Pix na hora, vc vai ter que refazer o cadastro e esperar entre 2 a 18 horas. Pelo amor de Deus isso é desumano. Deixando de ser cliente em 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 e até nunca mais BANCO INTER | um dos melhores bancos que já usei | muito bom | Zero | Banco robusto, consolidado, com plataforma de investimentos própria e atendimento bacana! Tem valido a pena! | Bad. This app was originally Usend created by a friend of mine while he was living in California and studying at UC Berkeley. It was an awesome app until Inter bought it and eliminated several functions of the app, including the capability of using it online, editing your recipients, and canceling a transaction. Now, if you enter any information incorrectly, you have to deal with all the burocracy common in Brasil. Se podemos complicar, por que simplificar? Awful. Don't waste your time. | bom | Melhorou depois da última atualização. Area de investimentos poderia receber melhorias, média de valor de ações não é calculado corretamente as vezes. Estou aguardando a ""evolução do perfil"" já tem um mês. Edit: suporte é mais demorado que fila de banco físico e fecha sua conversa se você demorar mais que 5 min pra responder. | Péssimo banco e aplicativo... Vivo no exterior e não consigo acessar minha conta. Tenho conta na em outras corretoras e bancos e consigo resolver tudo... | Fraco. Cheio de bugs. Não me mostra as informações de extrato q eu sei que existem. | muito bom | App fraco. Não mostra sequer a hora da transação no cartão de crédito. A exportação para csv do extrato também é uma tristeza. Ninguém fez sequer um benchmark com o líder de mercado? Amadores | Tela do app toda branca com letras brancas... Não dá pra enxergar nada 😕 | very well...nice | Péssimo aplicativo. Sempre fora do ar, nunca consegue conectar ao serviço de abertura de conta, trava toda hora. | Banco difícil de trabalhar. App complicado e pouco intuitivo. Precisa ter muita paciência. | Mudando minha avaliação. O app em si é okay. Quase tudo funciona quando deveria. O problema acontece quando algo dá errado e você precisa recorrer ao suporte. É um inferno. Mesmo sendo Inter One, o processo é moroso e cheio de transferências. Falar pelo chat do app é esperar um dia pra uma informação simples sobre uma mensagem de erro ser dada. Pelo telefone, é ainda pior porque ninguém sabe de nada pra te ajudar. Pra um banco dito digital, eles são bem engessados no suporte. | Agendamento de resgate do cdb porquinho não funciona. Minhas contas atrasaram por isso e tive que pagar multa. A equipe interna diz que não houve anormalidades, ou seja o normal é o ""super app"" não funcionar. Não recomendo. | otimo | Criei uma conta recentemente, e não consigo liberar o limite pix minha conta não abre mais fica travado em atualização de cadastro. | A primeira tela nao é nem de boas vindas, é ""habilite o GPS"". Que piada. | Atualizaram a interface e ficou muito bom. Obrigado. Quanto mais simples e PRÁTICO melhor. | toda vez que eu abro o app vem esse isafe. horrível. prefiro checagem biométrica | Down loaded this app and deleted it several times because I Don't know how to use it or why I need it!!! | Atendimento humano nota zero | Graças a Deus chegou essa última atualização, antes o aplicativo ficava fechando sozinho e falhando, agora sim está nota 10!! Tudo funcionando 🙏🙏 muitas funções boas e práticas do banco, recomendo, e a operadora também tem bastante internet. | Bom. Mas falta compatibilizar o app com a função ""Dark Mode"" do celular... Toda vez que entro no app tenho que desativar a função para conseguir usar o app, já que algumas coisas, como os números, ficam brancos mas o fundo continua branco. | App muito bom, porém essa nova logo é uma tristeza. Parabéns aos envolvidos. | good | Esse novo ícone é horroroso :( | O novo ícone é tão ruim quando redondo que dá dó, era tão bonito antes | F****** this | they give me nice benefits | Não deixa logar. Vão ficar sem dinheiro. Edit: Uma vez logado o app funciona muito bem. | Muito bom | Otimo | Have none at the time just got the app","{""1"":155962,""2"":51813,""3"":51813,""4"":192598,""5"":2422655}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Banco Inter SA","Banco+Inter+SA","faleconosco@bancointer.com.br","https://www.bancointer.com.br","Av.

Easy.","10,000,000+",10000000,14897402,3.7677157,"3.8",214689,"Xfinity app sucks. Why does chat only opens in chrome and not other browsers. The speed test doesn't work it just spins. There's no notifications for outages. Chat sucks u go around in circles and get nothing. Chat will tell u issues are fixed but the issues never get fixed. Why when an unknown device connects to your network u can't forget it. U have to wait for it to disconnect then u have to disconnect it yourself. | One star is one too many. Cant access email and cant access voicemail. | This app has been terrible in recent months. My Internet has not worked right at all the past few weeks | update payment method has error for last 2 weeks that says unable to update due to technical difficulties try again later android app or my Hp Laptop and both using Chrome | awesome. | Honestly, if there was any other options for internet in grays harbor, I wouldn't chose to do business with xfinity/Comcast (all the same company)... beings my family and I have experienced the worst bad business, excessive charges never corrected. phones that were suppose to be free, charges outstanding in addition Internet usage while the phone company blocked hotspot or unlimited Internet from connecting while at home, forcing over data charges on ""supposive free government phones"", dishonest | This app is absolutely horrible. Trying to find simple things like tracking your claim on a damaged device send you down a rabbit hole the leads to nowhere. Half the time it ends up with a 404 bad page error whatever the hell. Don't get me started on the assistant spins in circles doesn't know half the time what you're trying to ask it to do refuses to get you an agent. I filed a claim on the 11th so what two to three weeks ago and it still hasn't been processed how many huge mistake signing up | bad connection | Terrible | Lame service that requires an android app(this app) to administer their version of ""parental"" Mac address filtering. These people cater to our youths being online behind parents backs. Used to be able to allow ONLY certain Mac addresses. These people's way of parental controls are bypassed by VPN. | I'm looking for cheaper Internet | I just spent an hour of my time trying to pay the stupid bill, happens any time I log in or call. Tired of this mess! | still learning more | the service restoration technician (I did not catch his mane) was very capable and efficient. he detected several other problems that might have been affecting our signal reception. he replaced the cable and placed a work order to repair the outside pole attachment. he tested line service put his paper boots and checked the modem was feeding all our devices. all this in 30 minutes. that is why we continue loyal to Xfinity | If your Xfinity modem is ""not connected"" to the internet, the app will refuse to show device settings so that you can troubleshoot/fix them. Their virtual assistant is completely useless. Then you have to wait for a chat agent to pretend to look into the issue, pretend to try fixes, and finally have to send the issue over to someone else. Trash app, from a trash company. | didnt know this now am mad cuz this infor can be hacked at anytime | I don't know what happened, but the app went from being great and helpful (by letting me control my children's wifi access from my phone) to now I can't even see what devices are connected. Why change things that don't need changing?? | App keeps crashing. Had to download to activate new equipment. Can't troubleshoot voicemail because app says ""oops. didn't go as planned"" with option to sign out. What kind of message is that? More info, please? I hate this app stuff forced on people. Let me just talk to someone and activate my equipment with them! | love all the channels but going to have to get rid of some! | been with Xfinity for seven years and still have it in my household.. I rate it with four stars because of the services I have received over the years with Xfinity, I appreciate the plans I have chosen that are affordable. for me, so thank you Xfinity for the update plans that are affordable for the low-income residence. | changed price and switch my unlimited plan without discussing it with me. this company is acting in Bad Faith by making changes to my service and to my price though my internet service did not change. | Poor connections and slow speed | hate the service hate the app more | this app is garbage. It never accepts my CM MAC so I can't activate anything. The chat sessions always get reset when they ask me to approve something in a web browser, so I can't continue the process. I HATE THIS PROCESS AND I HATE THIS COMPANY | prices to high n refused to give Mr my credits for the acp program for almost a year | I don't know what kind of update was done but this app is trash now. | Easy 6o use useful educational | doesn't allow me to pay my bill online through app | THE APP CRASHES & INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE EVENT THAT SAID ITCTRIGGERED THE CAMERA...IT CLOSES!!!! SEVERAL DAYS NOW! FIX IT!!! NOT GOOD SECURITY!!!!! | App is slow and has errors. Comcast Xfinity service is very unreliable. Frequent outages. You cannot rely on Xfinity for any business or personal needs bc you never know when they will be down again. Terrible customer service. Comcast needs to be under regulation and broken up to protect consumers. | Why is this app tracking my phone all the time. Even when not opened? | very slow and terrible to use for them taking away the online quick pay and making customers get the app... thought it would of at least been better | never can talk to a real live person on the phone | This app is poor. It loads slow on my wifi and if I pause a device it never releases it to work normal. Cool idea poor execution. | Terrible app | too expensive. horrible service | My previous T-Mobile phone is on the app | Xfinity sucks, this new app sucks, trying to do anything is a pain in the a**. Always issues with the wifi and phone trying to connect. Definitely gonna switch soon!! | Takes forever to load and cannot make payments!!! | App works great, helps me stay informed. It is very intuitive. | data is not enough for high speed account. at least 2 tb required | Reliable Service!! | Awful. Lags and doesn't load half the time | Amazing, I've been a customer for about 4 years, and if im late and having trouble paying they work with you and don't even get upset and threaten to turn your stuff off! They're the real definition of a true to the word good company! Highly recommend | Worst at best! | they Messed up My new phone and are charging me because warranty doesn't cover their tech making buttons NOT WORK. They say they lowered plan price, disconnect home phone, etc ALL LIES | Painfull to use. Chat is AI and worthless. | There is a problem with the link to print return labels | cannot manage bill or svc, just a scam | Xfinity definitely lies on their billing statements. T-Mobile is way better and exact pricing. I'm not a boy but an actual Xfinity customer. They Lie on their bills. do not use Xfinity | Worst app ever. Won't load a d can't pay my bill! Been like this for awhile! They need to fix this issue! | App does not perform as well as old version. It often very slow, won't load or features won't load. Example the Outage map. Constant 400 error. In addition the info on rewards program does not specify plan requirement. Redeem free on demand movie but not available for stream plan. In app to pay bill and prompted to verify by opening app! If app keeps redirecting to web within it, then the app is pointless. | Horrible experience. Wasted hoursssss | unreliable, does not solve every issue. | Disappointed with Adv. tech rep who FACTORY RESET my gateway at 5pm on 4/23. The week prior was not able to see my GATEWAY on my mobile S22 Ultra. Made repeated calls to Sup. who has been working on my account for known issues for 8 months problems. RESET was icing on the cake with 30 DEVICES including resetting PSSWD/USERNAME. My GATEWAY not shown on Xfinity app under the tab for WIFI. I'm able now to view in a different area other than where it should be located for those with S22 Ultra. | love it | Annoying | slow | Great cable and internet service in Lake of the Woods. | I would complain but they don't listen and most definitely don't care | Please turn my internet essentials service back on. | Problematic. Nuisance to make pmts | Randomly shows unknown devices connecting to my network. I don't know what this app is doing | It won't let me in | TRASH, if I could give it lower I would!!! Not responsive and way too convoluted in today's landscape.... | Most of the options don't work. It doesn't even log into your account on its own but just opens a web browser. | Stuck in a login loop. Tried reinstalling. Still looping to a login screen. | It's fine but no access to email unless you go into help/ask. Which is stupid | sometimes it works | The app used to be a lot better a lot of internet management functions are quirky. The activity tracker on devices is weird or incomplete. The true status of a device (paused, or not) is usually false. I have times blocked out for my kids and they are actually blocked as per the schedule. But if I want to turn their device on during downtime it will not show as paused. So I have to ""pause"" a device and then wake the device . . .and typically, I have to wake the device again. | Useless app. Way to screw up what wasn't broken | My bill is high | Negative. My experience with this app is 9x out of 10 negative. Bring back the myxfinity app. | App is trash | Faster ok. | Can I please get a real person | Every update UI and app getting worse and worse. None bugs fixed, Horrible design, limited functionality - one of them no way to temporarily turn on Wi-Fi. When Wi-Fi is turned off per schedule It does not show it on the user profile, it need to turn off manually and then turn on, and then wake devices. Currently, I see only 1 positive feature, access to settings away from the local network. | Live chats are worthless | Rip off | My comcast internet use to be very good before and I don't know what happened. Now it drops constantly, at least 10 times a day, and my wife works from home so she relies on it. We've had technician come out and still has been dropping constantly. I've called customer service and still no help. Thinking about finding a different service if issue isn't fixed | Forced installation | going on 2 days of the app absolutely not working. xfinity was out to our neighborhood to ""better the experience"" of our services and they have been worse since | 04/23/24 Update: This app got even worse. The Assistant bot is useless and glitches frequently. By the time you get to a human being, you have wasted 30 min with useless recommendations, and the bot interrupts the chat with random tasks. Horrible....dear God please fix this. | The app is slow and doesn't work if WiFi is down. The company is somehow worse than the app. They are clearly price gouging where the competition that isn't in the area charges literally half what these jerks do. My price has increased 3 times in one year. Somehow 1200 Mbps is available but not 1000 or 800. They charge you for equipment. They give you a subscription to a wholly unpopular streaming service that no one uses or wants. The website and customer service are atrocious. RUN | Xfinty is too f!kd Up! | Have me no help, did give me stress and chest pain. No help at all, still waiting to get someone to help me | This app is useless.I don't know who is behind creating your app but they should be fired. You SHOULD NOT have prepaid Xfinity customers singing into a Comcast Xfinity Apps!! How is it y'all don't even have my correct address!? BUT I sure got service! But according to this junk app my service is at my old address. But its not cause I HAVE SERVICE at my house!! I'm this so irritating Xfinity is the worst when it comes to customer support through there App and by phone!! Awful 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 | Ordering new services doesn't work in the app or online. So you end up calling customer service, who will only offer you more expensive plans, pushing their mobile service and associated charges. Bait and switch. | To just be honest this app is horrible it has trouble connecting when I do finally get it to connect it causes my notification chime to go off repeatedly I can't find anything that I need all around they should have just left well enough alone the other app they had was a lot better than this one just like everything else about Comcast or Xfinity or whatever they want to call themselves this week this app is terrible The automated system when you call in is terrible | The modem provided disconnects every 3 or 4 days. My equipment never did that. | Always drop! It really sucks! You can't even use the app like you used to be able to. | My bill randomly went from 60 to 100 one month a while ago and when I called to ask why the worker laughed at me and said ""what are you poor or something you seriously can't afford 40 more dollars?"" when all I was asking was why it was that much suddenly. After that day I will leave bad reviews everywhere I can for this shameless, nasty company. Oh and your new app is busted and never works. If I weren't in an area with only Comcast available I'd be gone so fast. | It's a Sudo App | Literally the most UNRELIABLE CABLE COMPANY I HAVE EVER KNOWN!! If you make money online go with someone more reliable. This internet goes down every other day. Have the screenshot to prove. | Customer service goes round and round through the same menus, app screens, or Assistant chat memos. Cancellation or downgrading is made extremely difficult, making it a bigger headache than ever. | doesn't work when I need to pay a bill ever. worst app of all my utilities | We have requested to speak to a representative and all we get is a recording of you no assistance or Any Internet since we purchased this prepaid box I hate this. | Can't get at all, been waiting for loading 4 x today..

All I get is that the issue has been escalated and to be patient and promises for the refund. Extremely bad service. | Excellent | Fast and easy | A complete fraud and scammer website fooling people around and doing dirty business. I booked a hotel (showing all good photos of the hotel) in Goa through this website and that hotel never existed and instead that place was filled with all sort of bad people. They have no customer service in India and the foreign customer support representatives don't even bother to listen to your complaints. They should shut down their dirty and fraud business. Scammers! | Dishonest cancellation procedure. Worst customer service experience from external call centre in the Phillipines. My godmother had pnemonia. her doctor said flying would be fatal. They said they would refund but did not. 2 telephone representatives from the Philippines feined that they could not hear us and hung up on her face. Very unprudential business behaviour.

They end up being short on excuses and resort to ghost you instead of owning up to their mistakes and give what they promised. SCAMMERS AND THIEVES | Always find what I want | Great app to book my accommodation. It provides a lot of details on the accommodation facilities, attractions near by. Booking flights is not as competitive though. | The easiest way to look for your next trip lml | Pittoyable: Si je me connecte avec mon mot de passe ça bloque mon compte, si j'essaye avec le lien par mail, ca ouvre la session, dans le navigateur ! Alors a quoi sert d'instaler une application si la version WEB marche ? A part bouffer de l'espace et ma batterie je ne sais pas.

Dollars that I placed for a booking. Giving me the run around about sending email to the place that I wanted. Lies!! Merged calls to place and booking customer service and Still after hearing that booking needs to give me back my money still insists that they cannot give me my money back. Worst app ever, first and last of me ever using this app. I don't give free money away to an app that can't provide me with satisfied customer service!! | Very complicated alI i wanted was to send a message | Perfect | Good experience | Volos in εξαιρετικό ξενοδοχείο, με ενημερωμένο και εκπαιδευμένο προσωπικό. Ολοκαίνουργιο πεντακάθαρο Με τέλεια ηχομόνωση. Στο καλύτερο σημείο. | Easy and efficient | Very good | This company is just full of scammers and booking does nothing to protect it's clients, 15 years I used them and now never again. Check Trustpilot!!!!! | Poor customer service. They have not given an English speaking helpline number inside Saudi Arabia, instead have given UK number. These insane people think anyone experiencing troubls inside Saudi Arabia should call customer service in UK to complain. Too ridiculous. Not an advisable platform. | You | Better | هذا البرنامج يقوم بسرقه العملاء حيث انه يظهر المبالغ بالجنيه ويقوم بسحب المبلغ بالدولار ويكلف العميل ١٠% رسوم توفير عمله من البنك ويتعمد عدم اظهار ذلك حتي يسرق اموال العملاء ...كما أنه يسحب المبالغ بالدولار ويسدد للفنادق بالجنيه. | All right | ਰਾ ਮਾਹਬੂਬ ਵਾ ਰਗ ਰਗ ਰਗ | Good app to get clear information about stay and offers | It's very impressive | Great | Easy to navigate in a more centralized system | Cool | Very nice easy to use | Good choice | All went well | Easy and user friendly app | So much good | Good luck trying to get a refund. Customer service seems friendly but completely useless. | I gave booking another try, my own fault really just look at their trustpilot page. Over the last few years, booking have incorrectly cleared my account over Xmas which left me having to borrow money for presents. Overcharged me incorrectly charged me. Offered bookings pay at hotel and hotel pestering me for payment a year ahead. Let's be honest there prices are higher than most most of the time. Just look at google hotels and you'll see the difference.. awful app info on it not checked properl | Easy to use. Good range of offerings to choose from. It is always good to know how close or far away airports are. | ordered flight and hotell and was eligible for free taxi to hotell... but when I was going to order taxi it was only possible to do this from a different airport! custom service was not answering on this issue and I haved to pay xtra for taxi. | Excellent service from City Season Suites. Best place to live with family. Ms. Aye was very helpful and upgraded the room. Mr. Jonathan was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place. | Excellent | Top! | Excellent | Very nice and helpful I have been using this app for ages and it has helped me find the cheapest and best with no stress | I have used them a few times. Normally was OK and would have gicen 3-4 stars however after my last ordeal with them I don't see myself ever using them again. They made a mistake in my booking and from there had me, the motel staff and the motel supervisor as well as my fiance and two service dogs in a frenzy. Not only did they waste my time and energy but they didn't even offer to do anything to make up for their mistake. Guess it's OK to make mistakes on a booking. Disgraceful! | Quick and easy and very user friendly | Easy to use, good discount. Easy to monitor all of my travel bookings | My favorite app for reserving hotel stays and over all best prices. Quick easy booking. They could offer more rewards though I rented for 3 weeks through them now and have 0 rewards or 0 wallet balance. | I like you | Huawei Y7 Parem 2018 | Esy 4 me to arrange comfortable life | Easy to handle.....however surcharges to the price from the hotel are simply outrageous | Easy to use, secure, informative app. Used it for many years. | Always find the best prices here | Attempting to sign in on this app will result in account immediately being locked. | Easy-to-use | Very nice one | To high for 3 nights?","{""1"":237814,""2"":48233,""3"":104269,""4"":492993,""5"":3101871}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Booking.com Hotels & Vacation Rentals","8601716327451933581","customer.service@booking.com","http://www.booking.com/apps.html?source=googleplay",,"http://www.booking.com/content/privacy.html","8601716327451933581","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eJuvWSnbPwEWAQCYwl8i9nPJXRzTv94JSYGGrKIu0qeuG_5wgYtb982-2F_jOGtIytY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YIFlwc1AWzojzNi_SNhv1dw66NpzoHrd0EF9SBV8iNHIWKA4OYxcnA7vhBarUSFer58","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UOwVVA5Yx3lWT7Wk0uXDJlFQKIaK4CUd02K0KdLNnBexvewKNWNF6n07gFG7nr7AkR0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RT7RUxYnNAURQeDDgzfSyC-PWNy4Y-Ni1yDoHRKJlU4L21G10D1sPxLbO1K-6youHng"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0K_X1aa2RrJmSS2JMmO1w7fUkwoPXxMSkZGkwgBGixux0Xl80X0iHMUkkjUFe48LY6o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OL3QAgZMK2M8qPuaXS68w5c7jfnQCvjuYyIhZws6nbGx_4rYc1bRaH14bz9pSMfYNtg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b2xxYAI_AJhMoq-Ln93XZRc9LQLjdiJa-VuIQCSo_E34kIkjEcFgxLLmhv07cH-fpo0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3wdUw9NGcNKo9YzsNHeP0wdSkYXOd3UyYuvSR1VLmvPgI1gAwDGkzYg9VeP9oW4tK8I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2f0NZa4IkE6eX1b6DNicvDiHWUVvZCvz-EX_OPIrVWxoQ1mCxVEJeCuRfU8GfSxqTjRj"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/T6DwxNDG1_KIZSB0wYTcmOkBHCsfoREslhzCNjtooM09Kuqkb-3SBMr16MmtjQhr7RU""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTkZZwZycRE?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YIFlwc1AWzojzNi_SNhv1dw66NpzoHrd0EF9SBV8iNHIWKA4OYxcnA7vhBarUSFer58",,"Everyone",,false,"Feb 4, 2011",1714139048000,"VARY","We added some important info about our properties.

It also has one of the best-looking icon designs, for those who care about the visual look of their phone home screens. | Very good to use on this mobile phone. | I HAVE USED THIS BROWSER FOR 2 YEARS I AM VERY SATISFIED FROM THIS BROWSER(FIRE FOX) NO LAG OR CRSH IN ALL UPDATES VARY BEST PERFORMANCE | good | lovely browser | Trying to watch a YouTube vid to avoid ads is near impossible with this browser. Glitchy would be about the mildest description I could apply. Try to change to fullscreen, it CTD. Try to change resolution it hangs. If using headphones and you turn the screen it, headphones drop out. Commenting is almost but not quite, impossible. I just don't want to get spammed by the YouTube app with ads for alcohol and gambling when I don't drink and gamble. Firefox is completely unreliable for YouTube. | Can we get an option to delete the 'collections' thing altogether from the new tab page? I just want a clean thing that says 'Firefox browser' then my search bar | , bleszef | Add-ons work half the time. Too bad desktop add-ons were removed | The browser sucks now. It's been broken for a year. Why don't you fix it? | good and reliable | it's a great browser protects your privacy and allows extensions, just wish I could group tabs together to organize a bit better but overall great 10/10 do recommend | Nice 🙂 | This APP is horrible. You can not have multiple tap active at the same time. The programmer has code a switch between tabs with the same logic as the invisible exit command. So, you are logged out of tabs aka - cookies and cache cleared. Turning off the delete when exist does nothing. For over a decade, the browser saw wonderful. | Cannot open link from notification that coming from web desktop shortcut (made from firefox shortcut). Please make download location option to external storage. Tab display need rework. It will be much better if the tab can be resized manually and please add sub tab, so we can group some sub tab in one tab. | Nice app | Beats chrome, hands down. | Aashiq lslam | thats wonderful thank you have a nice weekend | Lovely | classy 🔥 | Amazing!! *_* See for yourself. Seeing is believing... | Best browser! Allows extensions by default, get ihatecookies and ""Google search fixer' to have a chrome experience on google 👌 | It's between brave or Firefox, there both are legit browsers iam still using both browsers,both100% good. | Why can't Bookmarks and Passwords have their own 'page'? I sometimes want to be able to leave them open while browsing other tabs but it's not possible. | 5 stars just for supporting addons on mobile. One minor quibnle. Firefox is missing Simd support on this device. Chrome on this same device supports Simd. 👎 The same version of Firefox on my android tablet supports Simd. Also, what is the point of the generic dev feedback here telling everyone to post their feedback elsewhere? Does someone get paid to do that? Copy, paste, $$, am I right? | 2 Good | Good | Thanks I've used this my whole life and I love it!! | its Firefox. I love Firefox. | This browser is great because of the ability to install desktop extensions. However, the search engine is extremely outdated, not even allowing the user to zoom into web pages or images. On top of this, I cannot seems to download files from any website while using this app. I have checked and the app is up to date, but the features are stuck well in the past. EDIT: With the help of a pretty easily accessible extension, the app is now completely up to date as a browser. | PWAs don't scroll smoothly. Refresh rate in dev options says 120hz but the PWA is clearly not scrolling as smooth as the website does in the firefox app. Edit: No thanks. But if you'd like to do that on my behalf, that would be pretty cool of you. | Excessive battery drain over the last few months. Would have been 5 stars before that. Update to the reply: looks like this has already been reported on the forum multiple times with no fix. Any ETA on when one may come? | Firefox is the best, F the rest. | ood work | Yasarrizwan | I've been on it before but now days we need to stay vigilant everywhere we go everything we do thanks Firefox. | Best regards | works great, but check privacy settings, defaults are invasive | faster than chrome | I agree to use fires | Top many nagmails | Adding bookmarks is broken | Is there an option to set a certain webpage as Homepage? Please add customized secure dns over https setting. | nice | Fastest browser | Hate the new view | Of the not metabrowsers I have downloaded, this is my favorite! Privacy is important to me, so after I noticed MS' Edge was collecting data without my use -- to be fair I only checked the browsing history & I still like that Edge & Firefox (FF) allow me an on-demand option to delete History & browsing data (plus, I still enjoy many MS products) -- I tried the DuckDuckgo browser. Like Chrome, DuckDuckGo has perks (I'll review it next) but for my needs, of my said browsers, FF has it all. | I like some of the functionality of Chrome a little better (eg. Built in table widgets for pro sports scores), but FF is a close second. Then you consider I can use uBlock Origins with FF for Android for a much more clean and enjoyable browsing experience and it's rocketed way into the lead over other browsers Easy pick IMO. | I use the App, on my android phone, and keep getting blocked on my some important websites. It's not possible to turn off pop-up blockers. I don't have any add-ons and nothing you told me worked. I have to use another browser, for the pages I'm blocked from, because it says turn off pop-ups, but I can't. Since I have to use another browser for some things, I might as well just use that browser for everything. Firefox, you disappoint me. Bye 👋 . | Use material design 3 atleast on Android, ui is preety boring and bad, so why not use latest... Open source doesn't meant ""not to get inspiration from google"" | An excellent product. | I wish you could reliability swipe the tabs to close them otherwise I've no real nit picks 🎉 | More trustworthy than anything Google makes | Nope. Every update make this browser worse. Pages take 30 seconds to load now on wifi. Completely unusable app | End Google's hostile takeover of the internet. | Video frame rate drops after you pause the video and play again | The app is fantastic | Does not play well with Facebook in the browser. | good | Good | Best of browser to my phone, but it lack just 1 feature Selection of tab, like combining 2 or more tab If this is updated it will be one of the best browser | No longer the best browser. The old version was fantastic. But I hate the new version. - new tab management is ugly and awful - the two most common actions you do in the tab management is: 1) close the current tab 2) open a new tab. But one is at the top and the other is at the bottom, so no matter where you place the toolbar, half chance you'll have to move your thumb all the way up/down - missing open new tab from the settings dropdown - missing favorites/recently visited/recently closed tabs | Where's the tab bar? Version 125 should have included it from the beta channel. | Good | privacy is great and great browser overall | Download fails most times and the name of the file you wanted to download is.made very long with lots of %20%20 and when the download function does manage to work there is no progress bar or anything, you just find the file in downloads folder after some time. | DNS setting is missing . Please add DNS setting so we can change it. Thanks | still best browser, hands off! | So close to greatness, I love Firefox on desktop, and I want to use it on mobile, but he MENU, this might seem like a small gripe to some but a vertical menu on a phone feels bad and looks bad, whenever I enter a site I need to scroll down to see some of the option I want in the menu, can't you make it like edge or samsung browser? We press the button and a customizable horizontal page show up with option to select the settings you want | Overall great, but some ""features"" makes using experience a pain. The biggest fault has to be that when you switch apps to look into something, it refresses the page you are in. This makes 2-way authentitacions, filling in forms etc next to impossible. When you fix this bug, I will change my review back to 5 stars, but this makes the app next to unusable. And this isnt a recent bug either, it has been this way for years. | Great features. good service. Enjoy setting up this up. A good and solidarity service to have. A very important part is to have online business and business.. It's very helpful, and I'm very surprised 😮 that Google doesn't have this feature | perfect | It's the only browser that's actually a unique browser and not just Chrome for the 2,763rd time. That alone is enough of a recommendation in my book. | I hate the new update. It makes Google search unbearable. I want to uninstall and go back to how it was a week ago. Everything is so clunky now, too much info for something I'm trying to search quickly. Hate it. | niche | I have been using this browser for a while now I never had any issues opening new tabs until now. How come eveytime I open a new tab it keeps crashing and I had this problem for a dam month now! Fix this issue now or I will have to move to a new browser. Thank you, for my message and I hope you actually read it and fix it too. | Betlogburat. Buraot ng google. Tell us | Sucks | BEST BROWSER BY FAR KEEP IT UP FIREFOX.. KEEP ADDING MORE FEATURES ETC. | always the best browser! both desktop and mobile. been my fav for more than a decade. | very nice 😍 | exlent | Website not open ,said website problem, but,same time another browser vivaldi open that website | Good browser for privy | Fullscreen crashes browser. Settings aren't saved even when logged in and synced. Youtube video playback quality is dropped to 240p at the slightest hint of problem. | shiva | Good service | it takes getting used to.. not very intuitive. but better than Google taking all my data info. | The experience is definitely getting worse. | great | It's not chrome. | The best Browser there is.

Downloaded the app and signed up. I keep receiving an error msg and try again later. Also, I receive text messages that gives a code to verify phone numbers, but there is no place to put the code. This app is not worth my time to try to deal with. | 🚫🚫 DON'T DOWNLOAD 🚫 I downloaded this app on two different phones and it still wouldn't work . | Great | Needs work it's a good idea to have a app for help or shopping but the freezing up is really bad and not loading properly also needs fixed if all this gets fixed I will install it and use it again but in not going to use it till it fixed | Splendid That's There's FINALLY An App...But Doesn't Completely Function Properly~And One Can't Place Order From The App...So It's Almost Useless... | Needs to be fixed,It keeps on freezing up | Need to update the website to be more like the mobile app. The wish list is the best part. I hate the fact you can find things on the mobile app that are not on the website. | Awesome, favorite store 😍 | The app was not responsive. Hoped-for the best but it took forever to use things like filtering my search. | There is no add to cart button | JELLO | this app suks! it locks up when i try to load more items to browse through! there's no discounts or incentives to go to the stores! | This app is continuously freezing. I can usually click to see more items twice before the whole app freezes. | I like it a lot | TN.LT: Vô Nhân Chấm:.Vô x=T | The Dollars Tree app needs an item aisle locate feature. Not having this feature is going to hurt their business in the long term. Walmart, Target, and Hyvee have item aisle located features. I shop more frequently at stores that have them. I give Dollar Tree two stars, because they do have items that can maybe save you in a pinch if you're low on money, for lots of things like birthday/holiday cards, toys, balloons and much more. They have a new $3 and $5 section, in addition to $1 on most item | A good store it's very clean and the people who work there is very nice and helpful good store 2shop in. Have a great day Katrina Morris | I can No Longer Order in App for delivery to Store or Home! I use to be able to order items in the Dollar Tree by Quantity, - was able to pay in App for store pickup or home delivery.. WHY CJANGE YHE BEST FEATURES UOU HAD!??? UNINSTALL.. I DONT WANT TO LOOK AT ITEMS, I WANT TO BUY THEM, EVEN IF I HAVE TO SHIP THEM TO STORE TO PICKUP, & PREPAY IN QUANTITY. | Tried signing in to app, but keep getting ""you need to change your password"", so I click on change password on DT's website & every single time I go to enter my email addy, the keyboard pops up & then immediately disappears before I can enter even start to type my email in! I even switched to the desktop view on my mobile phone cuz I don't own a PC nor a laptop & it still does the same thing...I'm soooo frustrated with this stupid app, way easier to go in store to apply for job!!! | Not for ordering online. | Borderline unusable given how often it freezes. | Products staff help from staff and cleanliness of store is a breath of fresh air | They all have my favorite snacks just for 1.25 I love it | Useless app in my small town. | Better than Planned! Driver communicated order Delivery was prompt and precise✔️👏 | It freezes a lot, it won't let you scroll through multiple pages to see more items. Have to restart the page to get stuck in the same spot all over again. | Will not let you reset password | I love dollar tree, but the app is slow and freezes constantly. | Horrible app! Useless! It is so unprofessional the way favorites/wishlist is setup. There are more issues but it is not my job to improve their app. I'm sure they got more than their money worth for developing app...🙄 | This is one of the most amazing stores | My app keeps freezing when I try to like an item to remember it for purchase. It freezes when I try to load more. | Does not work properly | I like Dollar Tree, I go there at least once a week. I can't say much for their app. It's an absolute glitchy nightmare! | I think 3 stars is generous the app is easy enough to navigate and even though most dollar trees are small my problem is they need aisle numbers in store and on app each store layout is different also the app don't tell you if the store has item in stocks or not that be helpful | The app works never had a problem with it freezing or running slow. However, you can't order from the app. So what is the point of it? | Useless. | Not compatible with Android 14. I installed this because the website is slow; but this app only loads a green background with the Dollar Tree logo in the middle, and that's it. No app functionality, no loading anything, just an image of the logo. | Great please keep prices down | Can only order bulk items | This app won't let me change my password! Weird! | Junk. Won't let me log in says I don't have an account. Try to create one and it says I have an account. Deleted it. | Freezes alot and can't order anything needs to be fix | It won't let me sign in or create account or change my password or contact customer service. I want to use the app because I shop at Dollar Tree all the time, but I don't know how I can. | Just started/opened app. But I love 😘 the Dollar Tree 🌴... Store. So I'm sure the app is going to be good as I go along. | The app freezes way too much. When I click to load more items, it doesn't register. When I click other buttons, it does the same after a couple minutes of being on the app. It gets frustrating and feels useless to have the app. It would also be great to be able to order from the app. | Why can't I order online any longer to ship to my house? It was my favorite feature | Can't purchase through the app. | I love shopping of my life | Why can't you order on the app? Kind of defeats the purpose. | Ifs good | App is so difficult to use. Super slow. Otherwise, nothing happens when you click on something or the page completely freezes while loading the next page | I love Dollar Tree and was super stoked to find that they have an app now, but every time I try to use the app, it takes FOREVER to do anything. Oh, I want to favorite a product? You have to wait 5 mins and tap the screen a million times. Oh, you want to look more at a product and not just the name and picture, hold on, let me load and buffer for 20 mins. These are bugs in the app that need to be fixed ASAP. Please fix this DT | The app keeps telling me to update my password and then will not let me change it. | Love Dollar Tree but this app horrible. | Love me some dollar tree. | I really appreciate finally having an app for this store, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to like my android phone very well. I can scroll through a subject for only a few seconds, then it freezes on me.... | My new 99 cent store since the others are closing down | product will not load and pages freeze and will not load and have to close app | It sucked. Would not let me create an account. | It's very glitchy, constantly freezing up. | I love it. | Won't open | It tries to force you to turn on the device location which is unnecessary when people can just type in the ZIP code or whatnot like I always do but it keeps harassing me to turn on the location and won't let me do anything on the app because I won't turn it on which is highly suspicious... | Lots of things that you can actually use and are good quality. | I downloaded it attempted to open app, ain't happening. Uninstalled, download it again for the second time, still doesn't open. | When I open it it goes blank. It sucks | Excuse me for interruption, but you have a problem with the store on green wood and s.p.i.d corpus Christi texas, one of the employees who was using bad mouth on the side of the store yall need to come and correct it I don't know what goings on | Loaded quickly....easy to follow prompts....Sally Martin | Satisfied 😀 | Love it | Wonder just wonderful | useless, I can't add anything to the cart | 👍🏻 | I can't get app to show anything!!! | Useless! I installed and it wouldn't let me search for a store without providing access to my location, it wouldn't search for a product that I know they carry, won't let you order from the app, and basically doesn't work unless you give it access to your entire phone. I just wanted to search what store had a certain product. Again...useless! | Down loaded the app 3 times and it won""t open | The app was downloaded but it didn't do anything. I downloaded from the Play Store. I went to open it and it didn't do anything. I basically had a blank screen with a little header that said Dollar Tree. So I uninstalled it. | Irrating layout and app, I hope it can improve because I deal with a lot of ""annoying"" apps that are hard to navigate and slow, but this app was especially irritating. Same thing with the dollar trees website it needs improvement. It's slow and hard to navigate at times. | Trying to download app on my android. Go to open it and wait ..nothing. anyone else experience this? | I can't get in | THIS REVIEW IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE APP ITSELF... IT'S OK!

Dollar tree is really a good place 2 find deals. When I lived in IE there was a really helpful manager named Manuel M. He was so helpful & awesome. The app is very helpful as well. | Not really sure what it's for. You can't shop on it. | I don't understand the point of the app if I can't order through it. Once they add that capability, I'll download it again. | Can't log in | I really think you should be able to order from the app. Sure it's great and all knowing what's in the store but there's no point in having an app just to look at the products. I want to be able to make purchases and go pick up what i need in the store if I'm too busy to go and shop around. With the prices being raised and an essentially useless app, I'm really questioning my loyalty to thie dollar tree brand. | Great job on the new app. Very smooth, works excellent. | Please have separate isles for different prices. MY local stores have variety of prices all lumped together. If the items are not on the right shelf, it's deceiving! Or price each individual item!. | Reviews are public and include your account and device info. Learn more Jon C Behling Rate their app Dollar Tree | How can you tell if something is in stock? Need to be able to order from the app too. | Wants me to update my password, but when I get link, follow it, put in my email address, the try to type the new password, the keyboard won't stay up for me to type it in.

Not worn | There are so many great finds for a great price 👍 | I absolutely love this app! | Horrible! You have to go purchase an Apple Card for $100-$500 (they 1st say $500 then if you buck them they go down to $100) for a buyer to purchase directly from you. Nowhere in their policies or guidelines do they advertise7k this inconvenience. Wow! They wait until you have a buyer trying to make the purchase before they sneak that one in. And it gets better. They tell both the buyer and seller that the money cannot be refunded. Better Business Bureau here I come. | like so far | Had a message to update the app. When I tried to update, it went back to need to update. | I have to turn off my phone's Wi-Fi to share all to share parties. Slow to notify me of offers on things I like or that sold. | I can't post pictures from my library...very frustrating. I shouldn't have to start over & retake photos of items just to post on 1 site. | About 2 out of every 3 purchases I make are poor quality...as in they don't fit as advertised, are worn out, the thighs are rubbed, a tiny hoke in the fabric of a t-shirt and the seller didn't disclose. I usually have to take the items to a consignment shop to try to recoup some money. | Plenty of traffic for a Sale platform as a seller, Wide range of clothes, shoes, home decor, accessories etc., Easy app tools as a Seller & Buyer! Recommend you check it out! | Great! | Vish site to order from. | No sales | So far so good tremendously koolness | Haven't sold anything yet. But really like the site and how easy it is to sell your items. | The app isn't needed for me because I am a buyer. I enjoy shopping from my laptop, not an app. But if you are a seller, this app would be necessary, so you can take pictures with your phone to the app seamlessly. If I were a seller, the app would more and likely be 5 stars. Being a buyer, I really have no use for it. | Outrageous fees for sellers, overpriced shipping for customers. Many other platforms with reasonable fees & shipping. ZERO STARS | Not happy with my experience with this app at all. There are too many scammers and cheap dollar store or thrift store sellers marking up the prices to ridiculous costs (an ikea mirror original priced at 29$ is over $175 here!) And POSHMARK won't let you just ""make an offer"", it tells you what minimum price you can send. If i want to offer 20, it should force a minimum price recommendation, no matter the asking price. Such a scam site now. Garbage! | Crashing again right now! | Just as I thought Poshmark makes it hard to get help retrieving your money back from a seller who was not upfront from the beginning. This app is useless | so far, it's easy to post. Now, just hoping I have something someone wants. | This company is absolutely terrible. I used it once time several years ago and now they send me emails like six times a day and when you try to turn them off it forces you to download the app, but after you uninstall the app they turn the emails back on. I wish i never used their service and would never recommend it to anyone else under any circumstances. | You can sell & buy almost anything! | I've used this app as both a buyer and seller for years. The most annoying issue for me is that there is no way to block seeing listings from a particular seller. With the rise of drop shipping there are plenty of closets that are full of THOUSANDS of repeated cheap stock image items. Blocking does absolutely nothing. The only condition filter available is 'new with tags' which is inconvenient as a vintage shopper and also doesn't provide a way to filter out the drop shipping garbage. | I absolutely love Poshmark. I've been. selling and buying for years. They continue to make the site better with upgrades and additions. It's an easy platform to buy and sell! 10 stars! | love poshing | LOVE THIS !!! | Fees that poshmark takes for sales are too high. | Very great app and amazing prices. | Ready to use and great community! | this is so strange. Idk why. bit these resale sites are not money saving, Just what I have noticed. I love the response below! it's cc processing fees! Wow. that's so funny. | Let's fraudsters sell items and does not back the consumer! Will not ever use again! I attempted to get help from Poshmark, and they were absolutely NO HELP! FRAUDSTER STILL KEPT MY MONEY | so easy to sell and negotiate. | This app pops up often and doesn't let you exit out of it | Easy To Use Site, Flat Shipping Prices When Selling or Buying Lots Of Options All Around Great Site To Buy,Sell, or Just Look Around. Highly Recommend This Site! | It's hard to shop when the app doesn't work. If you like watching circles going round and round then you will love this app. Not only will you get the circle to watch but they also will send you inventions to watch the circles go round and round. I guess to sum this app up best the word I would use is annoying. I can't shop when I want to become it's unreliable and constant notifications. | Poshmark sucks!. They take advertising to a whole new shity level. It's almost like they want you to buy stuff that doesn't fit so you can rePosh it so they can double their Commission. And God knows don't ever try and return something. Hopefully they're not in business long. | Love the Poshmark app. It's where I sell all my old and some new clothes, shoes, home items and more. Super easy to operate and use. I recommend it to all I see trying to get rid of a lot of items. It's like an online garage sale. You and others can make offers on items, and shipping is really fast. Buy, sell or trade. Great app from my personal experience. | Super Friendly So Far! Smiles | best platform for selling items off. | Won't download. | Love this buying opportunity! | Great place to sell clothing and accessories. | great | English / Owner wigs and toppers / cosmetology licensed/ color specialist/ thinning hair specialist/ message me with questions? | I really enjoyed this app allows me to sell my products without having any issues | A great place to buy and sell items | I am having so much fun here buying and selling. recycling clothes is the best, making new closet friends. | It's very easy to list items on this platform. I get the most engagement on Poshmark than any other platform out there. | Great app but since the new update I can't post anything for sell because it won't load up the pictures. Been a few days and still it's hard to post anything to sell. Kinda frustrating 😕 | Great app for reselling. They do take a cut if you sell something though. And the shipping sucks but overall, it's a great place to shop | I just opened up an account put on 4 comic books to sell 2 Days later I sold the Josie and the pussycat she sent the money I was putting it in my bank account information it came back wanted some more information you wanted me to put $300 on my account for 30 seconds I'm not doing it you said that's the only way that you can do this that's the only way you can verify that it's me by money on my card I saw the book for 33 I don't know why you want 300 on there just to verify it was my account | its taken 30min to post 1 item. 1st time the pics didn't register, and you can only delete one pic at a time. but not the cover pic. that one youre committed to and can only edit or replace. regardless its doesnt matter if you filled everything else out. no pics , no drafts, no lingering. had to fillbit out twice and was ridiculous. need to cut the edge asap | I just wish the postage wasn't so out of sight! It doesn't make any sense to pay so much for a pair of earrings or a pendant, as you do for a pair of shoes! | Scammers are all over this app. Be aware of those scams. | easy to use! | Since the last update it's been frustrating to not be able to add photos to your listings. I will get messages say my pics aren't supported. Then an hour later it will accept them. I've wasted hours uploading pics that disappear.I've contacted support & have not heard back in over a week. I can only imagine the number of sales I've missed. the Quick list feature works fine as long as your doing posh show listings but again when creating a covershot for your live posh show the same loading issue | great app to buy and sell! | great app to sell used clothing and make a little profit. wonderful for kids wanting to earn money. | Not sure who monitors the price of Casio watches but there crazy on here they have used ones marked up 1000% or more ,I seen some that are 99.00 brand new on Amazon and people on here asking 600.00 people do your research before getting scammed by crazy prices of used items especially watches on here there is no regulation going on | Kinda glitchy from my pc and customer service takes a long time but get a lot of traffic and shipping is much easier to deal with than eBay. | Love this app, however I feel that items that are listed on accounts that haven't been active for a while shouldn't pop up at the tops of my searches. | Ehhhhh (never used) | I'm tired of the searches being 75% promoted item from Poshmark. If I search for NEW items then I Don't won't Promoted Used Items in most of the search. | Fee's are slightley high for sales. However, not far from other apps. Great people !! Pleasant atmosphere ! | very friendly | I am having issues signing into Facebook for marketing there's no unisex option | Bad trying to return item and can not get superpotta address. | I'm New on here I hear about Poshmark is good to sale or buy items | I love having my own shop ONLINE and Posh is perfect for it! | Perfection!!!! Individuals are who you deal with. No bad experiences for me. Sellers are wonderful, ship quickly and a transaction is painless, not it's a joy. I'll be back for more items. | love it | I Love Selling and Buying on Poshmark There is Always something to Like No Matter if It's New or Used Wonder Deals to be Had | Some app!!! Hard to beat ;) | Poshmark continually has glitches. They take 20% of your sales and I don't know if they still do, but they used to charge you taxes on the USPS. | Wonderful way to clear out my closet, make some money and find great deals on wardrobe refreshing. Easy to use app. | My first time. Wait and see... for the rest | I guess | There is both positive and negative weighing the same amount. Not being able to contact customer support via phone or chat is alienating . Having to wait 24 hours for an email response is not sufficient. Listing is easy & payment is superb. The overall setup is genius. They offer many options for sellers to increase their business. Poshmark is #1 in the preowned fashion market. You can find electronics, home decor, kids and pet supplies. Their prepaid shipping labels are helpful! | Great | Latest App Update- on 4/17 my Poshmark app started failing non stop, saying the site was down. Okay, hiccups happen. By evening the app had an update. The update is buggy and something occurred that is causing the same ""news"" shares, likes, ect... to repeat without showing anything new for hours. Then, all of a sudden, 600 shares. Engagement is down significantly. Hopefully you can do a hot fix quickly to resolve these issues. | Poshmark is an awesome app for buying and selling merchandise new and used🥰💯❤️ | I love Poshmark! | fair company | SCAMMERS!! Waste your time. Sellers don't respong to offers or answer questions. Then you buy some thing and days later they cancel the order and say it's no longer available? There is no acountability when scammers waste your time. At least on Ebay there is acountability. | I was scammed on this app and got no help from poshmark customer support when I needed it | Selling is going great, just haven't done the shipping process | love this website ❤️ | love this app for selling things you have! easy and doable! | Love Poshmark! | Always an excellent shopping experience. Customer service always work & resolve order issues pretty quick and app have always worked great. My favorite shopping app at the moment. | So fun | Very suspicious..no telephone number to call..asking for government ID's...? | Poor online service will not ship on this site racist people negative I am not selling trademark I put in writing that the product was a type duplication a look a like not affiliate with original product and they remove my listing I am in the brotherhood and a marketing consultant poor customer service and they hàve hackers on postmark site do not go to this site you are wasting your time | I am finding more and more when searching for an item to purchase I end up disappointed because it is attached to an inactive account. Does Poshmark not have a system to clear these things so its not saying they are available when are very much not? Some of the accounts I saw had not been active for years. | They charge a high price to ship broken products. We bought a cream, and paid $7.00 for shipping. It came a week later (initially it was to arrive in 2 days). The cream had spilled all over the inside of the wrapping. This website is garbage. | so easy to start and list! I'm mad I haven't done this before | Great App for getting rid of things you don't use :) | Poshmark forces you to to download and use this app for any purchase. The app is ordinary, i don't like or not like it. It's just another app taking up space and potentially collecting your data. They now force you upload your driver's license or passport to actually buy anything. Can't wait to read about the massive data breech after they've collected millions of driver's licenses and passports. | amazing app","{""1"":7917,""2"":2516,""3"":5304,""4"":12790,""5"":136477}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Poshmark, Inc","Poshmark,+Inc","support@poshmark.com","https://poshmark.com",,"http://poshmark.com/privacy","Poshmark,+Inc","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/usX9zpURCN66gkUY0H9aCIHAfZ05dFtpp2YWdFgiiuPNebbZNi9ayYkQHM8Sa1kP_A0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2Zzo83gS6xO6HmdTgjUCUAz8dXagyf2HGtjY_b-yNyNa-YTInLMnNwlQoq_l9tnorW8","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EfqfQvlYXIVMlfZSuQFxAYzeuYu7Bn7DkKFTfk8SFkxYkIK6vffQO3DS1zMh21mTNQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-AYke3m6PyWpAWEx13APNiuZ15FiJn5YRJCCQYiyjHr9qvxW1xfqrorRXq-CBtBSWg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5TWl9HYaqmSw443xZtPVcMLyp2iQrfXuD1EwDyRryGo718MQG7BODtLmRYrNalCv2o_X"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3-MzNj8Ue7gtGC0-DBqjEFJcDCW_CZdGdZmIo7ahMwrYDw4wG3mi-CVGTDYYndMckpLs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NfbVkCG8EBlXrRdFWnfk5zlgT1RwyqSMr-sRi0huG3JDYPBK8Gcu-XlFEnBPS0APyvs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VA__u-I6rilyuk94Cp6XxdAp4-phPcE13om-su9oYOtKSr8zg7WX9T3HcfIYv1AgPmc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_-JLmPIEIP6BQk7njXUd2qUwr2RduVBc70k3iecaYufiAk3iG--_ZWsuGdVKnOEnbQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5c_oIGI6MGikQxYdxGqNwswC4FQZpJ1DtmAAxuIToxrTFVydu5J8Qk7a5hPV0-y06eQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yvLopIXUShMIBhoIlCBG5zDEp9Qrr8JsPW6cvl-hB2JGG4HHgg6xKHGBMO293CQHHjw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6NBv_oxroY-_do3Oxsa-6VYSYiv9qhyP5s1Zi0qIKoKFTJBUZpMukGgkWcpYx5PxGg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a_ARKWCSehgIwFBZ7azxzcttx8Fp92pttF5H01XZYq-7dNbsj4GqTmEpNF9tT8IYWMs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r8A9fWQzO2T57pLbClu7FY15Fu1JgmFOdel68-Z6kyql1O11_x7h-E3ocYL2BEZvwHE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J-hkc9j6yAtsGcLZmiSNBYHUFtqebFym0y-k9zItGv6_VsslRCjWd8PdCkBm9ROWcZg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cNvOP95fxNrh-TvV12AhzGeeSxDVPWunMHnXGA3RPlhup7TbkpZ08C5EKZUZbpaHGbgU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/06Kd2LGVkswzKAIxgcqaQs0fWndCl3f2ByqXGf3LwsBRjz5SgN2Y9S3Z3q3cw6gp8w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2VmZDz_La327scq57cn6yUEau4TDQR4L_1uxB4QnAppEHUKlTH6y2shy6PUCHqMc54E"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/40Zn3zvsLtj9aJSINGM9GAL9n5InhJDzQbZLJNQwYHA-pygvt-hDNLdfNUWK8GScDQU2"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zoyT1Ww0xSk5PjvgdzdyL8_b_pAhwm3P68oPecNubDcz3AVtEBxzogu3fY_48LwrjkXC"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U2XMpzHqmc3N2KoIrRtt9vrRojGEPNlfrRpbhxTUHRIA3fqwBNbNUyibQN-gjJrzWwcF"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vgunGRal4WBU3vVeBPZZfcuceLIkd_6TOPV4LyXAaVX6gT9tJap7eWw9qgdFvyzmxL8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/S8_i1kcxPxFMsYcvwmSiuoFrSavq6KIyF6_P_w1ftE0jnylVumyP53ypd9qExv5_GCfB"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IE7Cha0HYuBjd0KciRtQMJVBKR6oB6w1Y2iEEIfzk_f3t_IncLZF3MBeIMWW8BYJ7w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GT3_upFR8KEHxBrf4jKC9TsPFmMKcztFqzHkSx6LfJutBg1vPNZEWfYM_o1vHkRJTsk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4-z8IB7pwt4Dy26uSXdsDpq2qQQ7nk4PowWt0M24lOeHeAfEAxC0UqmJXMwrFJLNRZc""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Nov 11, 2013",1712969462000,"8.60","• Refresh your wardrobe for the spring season.

Thank you Twitch.tv | Great app, basicly every streamer is on here so i like it | Still trying to figure it out but I enjoy it. I DL to support my son in his hobbies. Just wish it was clear on where the donation button is when you're watching someone on live stream. | Not going to lie I only use this to watch Kai cenats streams | I got it bc Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is on it now and I'll definitely be on twitch now | I'm trying to login but it doesn't work | The mobile viewing experience is so bugged I hate it. I watch all the ads, but once they're done, I just see a black screen and a mini view of the streamer I am watching. Since I'm stuck, I exit the stream and try to open it again, and then I'm shown another 7 ads bc they think I'm trying to skip them, when in reality, I already watched the ads right before. This happens like every other time I try to watch a stream on mobile. | 😕 | Milk | 10/10 I'm avaliable to see caseohs fatass | Twitch mobile is by far horrible experience so it has a tendency to crash the phone where all u have is the streaming in the bakground and screen and cant do nothing nor check other apps nor do nothing u have to reset the phone to fix this. | Good app | Bom | Amazing app! Can easily use on mobile or pc. Only issue I had was signing up. Much easier on a PC | the best ever | Pretty good but some recent updates made it a bit worse. | Love it | Super good | Entertaining and fun to see your favourite streamer | Okay | Keep up the good work make sure is safe and secure . | CAN'T go live on mobile I have good connection and everything but it just stop? | Didn't even let me sign up | Trash app it keeps crashing non stop every time I try to open the app up please fix this. | Soso gooodd | Stories are completely broken. I've force stopped the app, cleared the cache, uninstalled and nothing fixes the problem. It just says it failed to post repeatedly. Not a fan of the changes made to chat either. | W streams | This app is a joke. If you have a pre-roll ad, it freezes with 1 seconds left, never transitioning to the actual stream. It might work after several reloads and several ads later. Didn't used to do this. Besides this problem, app is fine for streams you subscribe to. | Thanks for deleting my account eventhough I was active within the 1 year timeframe. | I like the app but I hate signing in I keep putting in the right email address but never gives me the code | Really fun join my streams if you want | Good app | Editing who you follow and who gives notifications is a nightmare. I'm no longer going to follow any more streamers who I dont constantly watch until it's made reasonable. | Pls views | As a twitch streamer I will always love this app (: thank you for giving us a space to share what we create and for making gaming and streaming fun : D | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Nice | Nice | Good | after the update the app wont work | Good | Entertainment | New Update is bugging a lot, when you minimize the app or put it in ""picture in picture"" the app completely freezes. No way to use it again except ""Force stop"" | ADs are an absolute nightmare | What is this updates this is garbage | It's cool | Really, REALLY obnoxious ad banner right underneath the viewing window. | How long has ""stories"" been a feature? And yet, it's still bugged; it still loads after a moment and hides the highest viewed stream in the following tab until you scroll down and back up. Does poor little Amazon not have enough money to make functional apps? Also, if you ""respect my privacy"" so much, maybe respect my choices and stop trying to trick me into accepting tracking cookies? | Tragic, horrible performance. Just hire the guy who made a replacement app and stop embrarasing ysvs | your app is not working properly, chrome is doing fine it's just the app that's not working correctly | This app is amazing an anticipated success | Its best | I'm giving you a 5 but please fix your lagging streams. | Fun at all hours of the day to watch new games and streamers entertain | Good | Hate how limited the app is compared to desktop, no creator dashboard really sucks but the design itself is clean and well operated. Compared to Kik and youtube twitch seems to crash a whole less frequently. Absolutely love it. From creator: Thefri3ndlyhermitt on twitch. | Good | After the last update, i am not able to watch any streams, video stops every 2 minutes and only audio plays unless i reopen the stream | It's completely amazing!! | Great App! | Yuuuh | Love ❤❤ | Great | Fun to watch | Such a scam app. Force to watch adds even before to know what the streamer has to offer. Can ur app just wait like 10 seconds before the 3 min ads just to see if worth the effort¿?¿? ¿? Scammmmm | No wrongs | love it! I use it more then youtube | Great app. Searching is a little rough but overall it's fine | love it you can be live on your phone its so ez to do is the best in the best. | Fun | So cool! | app sponsered bots and hackers they tell you will promote your channel tell you to go to discord doesn't even save your streams probably using your streaming for their own content | Can improve in recommendations.

It was cold, soggy, and the veggies were limp and didn't seem fresh. This is not my usual experience. | Login issue. I am putting Canada mobile no. and it is taking only US. | Ordering from the app and site is becoming trash when you fix you app and stuff let me know till then I won't even try to order no more | the food was super delicious but they left out some of my order :( | Can't even login even tried resetting my password still can't | Charged me for an order but never sent it to the store then can't get ahold of anyone for customer service over the phone to fix the problem | This app is a joke | easy to use | App is not working on Android 4/26/24. Cannot sign in, only gives error message. | yummy | Keep charging 20$ for a foot long you might make enough money to pay someone to fix the app | Terrible app | This app is garbage. After the update, I could not get it to load my profile. It kept telling me it had to quit and then it wouldn't quit. I rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app. I got screwed out of a BOGO footlong deal and the points. | Extremely buggy, new bugs introduced often | App is very broken as of late. I have had to reinstall it multiple times as it's not been showing any words and fails to log in. Clearing cache does nothing to fix it has been going on for at least a month use to work great. Not sure what changed. | why do i have to sign in everytime | spend alot of money to get little points and half the time the app doesn't work | Keep getting access denied on update | Horrible app. Unable to process payments. Nothing saved was there. If you can't figure your app out odnt have one. | does the job. | Deals are good when the app works. What's the most basic thing an app needs to do? I've been unable to order on the app more times than I've been able to order due to a ""generic online error"". I've done all suggestions, cleared cache, completely removed and reinstalled etc., the error persists. I would recommend not getting started with the rewards as eventually you won't be able to order anyway. | good food nice people | Revising my review. The newer version is performing better. Still an occasional slow response, but I can complete an order. OLD REVIEW: The app is extremely slow to respond. It takes a long time to place an order because of the app response time. If the performance was better, I'd have no complaints. | Terrible app, can't even login. | Buffalo chicken mmm good | Won't even open. Just takes me back to the login screen | You cant view the menu when the restaurant is closed. Not even on google. | Doesn't let me log in even after uninstall/reinstalling & restarting | The app does not work. I reset my password, and still not able to login. Points are expiring, and I can't use them because of this issue. | App is unusable. ""An error has occurred. Please try again"" is all I get. Wish there was a no star rating. One would think a company as successful as Subway could offer a decent app. | 2024-04-25 Always got a Payment failed error since April 21. Tried to change other payment method or cards, cleared app cache, register a new account, nothing works. | Can't Log in... It asks to change password but I never get the email with the code. Tried multiple times. | I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 1 because ever since I updated to this new stupid app, it literally wants to decline my order with every single card that was saved on my profile. When there's plenty of $$ on the cards!! GET IT TOGETHER SUBWAY AND HAVE YOUR APP CREATORS FIX THIS ALREADY!!! | I can't even order on the app now. Keep getting a message saying try a different payment method. | Tried twice to make 2 orders and it got voided both times. The app is supposed to work for both Canada and US. It worked in Canada but not in USA. Instead of using the app to redeem an offer I had to pay in-person and no offer given. Subway staff told me this app is managed by a 3rd party and I understand why the experience was bad... | It can be a little clunky, but it works and I don't have to wait in line. | Very poor performance. It takes forever just to load up the app and the login takes forever to work if it works at all. It literally took me 20 minutes just to load and get an order place just to find out I wasn't even logged my account and after trying to login to earn rewards for my order it never work. | There is no way to report problem with order unless you spend the time to go through a process outside of the app. | Here's my typical experience with this app... (Running out the door... ""Hey, I'll order a subway to pick up on the way"" Opens app.. ""Update required"" Ok, I'll update... Open app, greeted with blank screen except two buttons, which are also blank. Take a guess and press one. Shoot, logged out now... What the hell is my Subway password? (Tries multiple passwords) finally gets it. It forces an update pretty much every time I try to place an order. What do we get for that update, hassle. | Terrible app. Logs me out regularly, and I have to go hunting for my password because the app doesn't support autofill. Then after 3 attempts you get locked out. Very annoying. Practically have to reset your password any time you want to order. Plus they make you swipe through an ad about the ""new rewards program"" EVERY TIME you open the app. | I've had nothing but problems with the app. Can't get into the app/my account or see my rewards any more!?! Pretty much sickening... | The app has nice pictures. That's about it....I can't order because it doesn't even load my selections in my cart. What a waste. | Everytime i update I lose all my benefits. So app gets one star til either refund my benefits or fix. Either way thanks for taking all my points | GREAT FOOD!! | How the duck does the subway in a pilot have a pick up area with orders ready to pick up but I cannot use the app or website to place an order?!?! | Something broke the app, it's unusable now | Errors almost every time I use this app. Wont take any of my payment methods. Never buying food from subway again. | User friendly. | A horrible, horrible buggy app. Almost as bad as the website, which is a dumpster fire behind a Subway. The year is 2024 and a national restaurant chain can't figure out websites or mobile apps. | Sent my order via online and they got it wrong. wrong cheese, didn't cut it like I asked and the cucumbers were extremely old. bread was smashed too, pretty sad cause I was on my lunch too. | The app has stopped working completely. Update. The app almost works after the latest update. New update: the app and web browser doesn't work. I wonder how many customers this loses Subway. | love this app one of the best fast food apps I've used! | I have never had more issues with an app and I've been using this for at least 2 years. It is a horrible experience 95% of the time. It is always the same issues- either dropping my order, payment, or not working at all. It has had many updates and continues to suck. | THE APP SUCKS. WHOEVER SUBWAY IS PAYING TO CREATE THE OLO WEBPAGE AND MOBILE APP NEEDS TO GET FIRE! WEBPAGE AND APP DOESNT LOAD. SAD! | App leaves me on the initial loading screen indefinitely | Most of the time doesn't work. | Pick up right on time. Customer service is the best. Thanks guys!!! | Terrible app. Deals only work for online orders and only at limited ""participating"" stores. That's if it even works at all. Tried multiple times for offers including coupons and birthday cookie special, Nothing works at all. | Randomly declines orders. Also maybe one deal in the Deals section. Just create a new section for Ads so it's not misleading | Stupid app won't pick location. Plus you can't look at the menu | Worst app ever build You can't see the menu if store is closed | It's good just won't save my log in | To me it's so easy. it's very clean. | Over $37 for 1 footlong & 1 six-inch. Must be for Legal fees after selling FAKE TUNA Subs for years 😂 (NOT tuna->look it up) | This app is horrendous, would give 0 stars if i could. I've tried several times to order anything on this app and each time it won't take any form of my VALID payment options. won't take visa won't take googlepay, heck it won't even take ebt!!! Literally been craving a sandwich from here FOR WEEEKS but the only cheap way to get anything is that bogo for footlongs! probably won't take my business here for a very long time. | quick and easy | I love subway but this app has yet to load the rewards, what's the point? | Slow and unresponsive app. Rewards refuse to load. Unable to place orders. Wasted entire lunch break trying to order a sandwich. | Does not even open for me 😭 | After 6 months, I figured I'd give it another try. I was able to put one sub and a bag of chips in the cart. It would not allow me to add anything else. *Sigh* Uninstalling, again. | Would give zero if I could. Terrible app. Will not let you get past login, and customer service is impossible to get through to. | App often has issues. And will not accept payment the last 2 times I've tried ordering. Won't process payments. I tried with 4 cards that work everywhere else. | Makes ordering before or at work very convenient but they do have some of the wildest rushes that will have certain restaurants have longer wait times but ordering online saves a lot of time. | App is now Terrible!!! Trying to place an order, Screen Get stuck on Loading and Never Completes, Left it for 5 minutes, and it was still stuck. App will not recognize my biometrics any more, Will not auto populate my password any longer. | App is very buggy doesn't work. | slow to load. despite using high end phones and factoey reset app take too long and is oftenly unresponsive. | Worst app I've ever tried to used. | Broken, you can't use it because it has you log in or continue as guest snd after it's a blank screen and crashes. | easy to use ! | this app was good and helpful | Almost every time I use the app it either needs to restart due to an update, or I need to sign in because for some reason I have been signed out. This inevitably causes delays at the checkout, delaying the people behind me. If you want to waste your time (and other people's time), use this app. | App used to be great but no longer works, no deals get applied, I can't redeem my points or the order fails and crashes | Update logged me out and won't let me log back in. Getting really tired of having to fight an app to order lunch, uninstall. | This app literally never works. It will never load so that I can choose sandwiches, or when it does load it always crashes when I try to place my order. This is the worst for app I have ever used. | When working is just fine but is often buggy and unstable. | I made an account to build points to use and now no matter what I do the app doesn't let me sign in. | Ease of operation. | When it works it's awesome but when it doesn't there's no way to recover points | Horrible app. I've tried to place an order through the app, once the payment was completed it suddenly showed an errors saying something went wrong. I had to close the app and restart it. I couldn't see my order in the order history page. I went to the selected subway location and they said the didn't received any order. However the amount was deducted from my bank account. I've tried to contact the customer service and it didn't work either. No response from them at all. | The app doesn't work 😕 | The app never loads, it always just in process of loading, but would never let u use it for hours when you are at the store, stupidity to even try collecting points! | There is free food | I have tried paying for my food many times, and I tried three different debit cards that for sure have money. Keep getting error code to try different payment cards. I uninstalled and refresh app but nothing works. Frustrating | Why do I have to pre-order to save?? Why can't I walk in and get a so-called deal. | 1- app really often doesn't work. 2- no complain options 3- no cancel options . So this app trash. | When the app works, I like it, but there's so many times that I get all the way through and it won't let me finish. | Won't let me sign in, or continue as guest. | Recently, I can't sign in at all. If I try biometrics, it closes the prompt and does nothing. If I try to manually type my credentials by hitting Sign in, it just says an Error occurred, try again. Can't even create an account if I want to because I get the same error. | Does not and has not worked with android devices in months. Have filled ticket after ticket with the tech support with no response. I can however order just fine from my actual computer. So the app is all jacked up and apparently subway is refusing to resolve or acknowledge the issue. | When it works, its great. Currently it is not working properly.","{""1"":50783,""2"":7300,""3"":12634,""4"":46783,""5"":272588}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","SUBWAY Restaurants","SUBWAY+Restaurants","appreviews@subway.com","http://www.subway.com/app/faqs.aspx",,"https://www.subway.com/en-US/Legal/PrivacyStatement-FWH","SUBWAY+Restaurants","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A9_9_JpCe_K0bNUJ8ZZfHT_TqgqwOynVXjZ7L06ZKY6E4-nZOTsVFXYy3sTIGAeNLpM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/o7_npRBYsYqk0mwI7mn8tmZ81ZRyZJ8Yn535mScAM6kQY94dsWV6YrGbOsDehuLqSo0N","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mkb_oEvpSgB4jF2DpMhm6SVLdJszsDiJzMNr3_x21qP4maExgRHwKUrbhY-7562V"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9ogseR1SryUlSN2xQx7E4Mc8kEoqVVUs3cRmS2ixTkyCl7b9spLfrWIPBS0U2HVXK6o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r8nmUT4zb4h5cZY9hpjwcorJ6KZhpIy32oBFwYRE2uKP6lUEKdkagB4hwRJhwPg69Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KK5AXlEMHmFss98weBUlqi4dUMMOWXnzwKY-NLIPSEQJeHVeshdfo86gA7zTPseAbBA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/roKOtuPPDedDOuizbeyFT0IPgaYHgb4ggnwz-2vB23kZsZSHGFFYuWA5WcZnpqpyUw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hJ4UlW5FqPKDBpkdwt_EbzJazopHLdcqK4GRq7YfRKSPg_0oL6HCf0kt2QuMlS9xIAE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UcBtU461qlEFICCpLVagXz_rTMVG6PMas1ofz-YZrw8AN3t8ekf_s4xg7PeY88hKwr4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sH9vDAPpeV334bLNi8ep91d_P7eBEiwlTR3TacSj8Bcp2Bbd2KgHMT8puWc3kM5mWek""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Jul 31, 2014",1713382586000,"30.7.4","Minor bug fixes and enhancements to make ordering your favorite sub even easier.

I have always loved my Yahoo Mail over Gmail. and now there's these ridiculous tabs and have to go searching for my mail in a million places.

Your reply to uninstall, then I stall again did not work. Still having the same problem 😕 | Where out of office? On mob app should be in a drop under tool bar | Cool | absolutely terrible client. forces you to see adds and wants you to upgrade to paid version. no features to sort or see mail headers. GET BLUEMAIL its much better. | I think it's absurd to try and charge me to get back into my account. I factory reset my phone recently and thought I wrote everything down but I didn't. Yahoo wanted to charge me for new VPN, pw Mgr plan and I couldn't pay so they wouldn't help me get back in my own account. I luckily figured out a way to get everything done and unlock my phone, no thanks to Yahoo. Just crazy, pay or no help. Your answer to this review must be AI generated. | excellent | It's servicable, if you can get past all the clutter and ads that have started creeping in. It's slightly less obnoxious than Gmail. Overall, I'd give it a solid 'meh'. | Excellent 👍🏾 love it. Thank you | love | do not like the new look it was fine the way it was | Pretty solid leap from the web browser. Not a fan of recent changes which have taken away the colored theme. App now only displays either light or dark mode. No colored theme. | This opportunity to review Yahoo Mail is timely...I HATE this new addition of reply/forward at the bottom of every email every time I open one. How do I get rid of this??!! | they charge you if you need help with anything. Yes I was sent to the help center and they told me I needed to pay for assistance. | With this new update it will NOT!!..allow me to change the background color on the email, the white background is very hard on my eyes...its very generic. Why provide options of color but no change. | not so good now a days | good | The new design is trash. Change it back. | 🤩🤩🤩🤩 | lovely | Been with Yahoo as long as I can remember. I've had no reason to complain. works every time. | you have to pay to this app | easy simple fast | looking for better customer support | Email sending very slow on fastest internet connection and i can't send more 5 or 6 pictures. Not stuck but very slow going out and how to send more then 5 or 6 photos? | overall the app is okay, but there are s few annoying things. emails from my pharmacy always go to spam folder despite repeatedly marking them as 'not spam'. on more than one occasion the notification sound has changed on its own. and most recently the dark theme has changed. used to be everything was the color you chose. now everything's black except the highlighted button up top making my two accounts look nearly identical. i much preferred the more colorful dark mode. | excellent and very easy to use | Apk tai | Good | this website is a scam of the highest order.

Minimalizing everything does not make something easier to use. Your research sucks. Your ux sucks. | The new set up is hard to customize. The script is smaller and everything is white or grey.

Ever since the update now it doesnt work properly!!! Fix it still having issues. This is ridiculous! Now my emails are going to the trash instead of inbox. Get it together yahoo.

Contacted the support number and the store the order came from and was told by automated message that I couldn't talk to anyone and was getting hung up on. Expect to pay for items you'll never see and no way to even complain if you use the app. | If you place an order that is too large for the portal, you will not get notified that your order is ready. | majority of cashiers never help it all, they don't know how to rang it up, to pay the difference between regular pizza to stuffed crust, and always being like I know how can I make this happen. the app doesn't have a supreme stuffed crust. please train your employees please. | pizza pizza 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 | horrible! I will never order again ! | Took over an hour to make 1 pizza. | simple and straightforward. What more can you ask for | I'm from Detroit. Caesars is the best | A passable app that is satisfactorily functional. | fast service delivery people are always fast and plied | App is very easy to use and efficient. | Love the app. Just needs an option to pay in cash at the store. Currently cards are all that's offered as a means of paying.. | great app i love it | ordered a custom pizza online. picked it up from the portal. my mistake for not double checking, but I got the wrong pizza. box and stickers are correct. pizza is wrong | Always quick and easy.. | easy to use. | foods good. price is right. | easy to navigate. deals are few. | very slow, not much of a friendly staff! | They use doordash to deliver 🤮 This review is for app only.. pizza is amazing | pizza puffs are the best | So far so good! | Fast and easy to use. My one issue is that after your order is placed, there's no way to change or cancel it. I can't even get someone on the phone when I call. | Delicious Pizza-pizza!! | Restaurant was open but not taking online orders at 745pm. So had to go in to order and wait. | I love this place so much. the app could be a little more easily accessible tbh | the app is great, I never have any issues ordering. the only problem I ever have is with their toppings. apparently if you order onions, the store will see ""O"" and sometimes give you olives or banana peppers will be ""bpeppers"" and sometimes they'll give you bell peppers instead. | cheap and good😊 | screwed up my order | Super easy and convenient! | The only reason you didn't get five stars is because you don't offer any reward system. I realize your food is already mostly affordable Reward systems work. They have been proven to increase business compared to similar establishments without them. | close on me at 7:30 | I am so sorry to say that was the worst pizza in wings I've ever eaten.😩😩😩 | App is quick and easy but. PLEASE BRING BACK THE STUFFED CRUST ! | Always great pizza | nope.. never again... almost 40 bucks for a Delivery, and only like 3 pieces of meat per slice... waste of money... Do Not Make The Same Mistake | bad customer service delivery drivers don't speak english and both deliveries mussing food. terrible | I love the Pizza 🤤 need more cheese though | pretzel crust is the best pizza ever | None | Very easy to use. And theyvalways have pretty deals in-app. | it's nice and easy... | awesome I love it | The Crazy Puffs are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Great pizza! | taxing | The employees at My local Little Caesars are always friendly and courteous. They always make you feel welcome. As I am completely deaf. They go above and beyond to help me. | This game sucked | App decided to wake me up at 1:20am to remind me I left something in the cart from how many days ago. Like seriously, eat shît. All app notifications are annoying enough as it is, then you have to deliberately program them to be double extra annoying!? | Pizza Pizza | fast and great price. The app makes the process very convenient. | great | burnt pizza | love it | hard to navigate | Well they didn't get my order right in fact they forgot to even give me the crazy sauce that came with my crazy bread. I guess I'll have to call and let them know My pizza had extra sauce on it instead of light sauce. otherwise the pizza was good | great value | I don't like having to use Google pay. I would like to pay and not have my card stored | does not allow any customization | did not give me a total before checkout and charged an extra $13 for delivery.i would've picked up given the option. | My order showed ready at 5:57 pm. I arrived at store at 5:59pm and my name was on the self checkout showing ready but nothing was in the box when the door opened. I asked cashier and he said they were about to put it in the oven which caused me to wait an additional 10 minutes. | luv this app | 1hot and ready | Little.caes | Worst food app by far. No way to customize your order. Can't pay with cash. Domino's lets you pay cash. I'll be ordering there from now on | definitely very easy to use.. just wish they had rewards or some kind of good deals. 3 off 18 is as good as it gets but better than nothing . | Good food fast service Love this store! | Always a problem. Got there at 840 for a deep dish and told it's to late we don't make deep dish after a certain time. No response when I asked what time. | Great pizza puffs, love 'em | Great service and food! | Pides ingredientes en la app, te los cobran y te dan lo que quieren argumentando que no tienen ese ingrediente, pero ya te lo cobraron. Cada sucursal debería llevar un inventario de lo que tiene y lo que no. Ya van tres veces que me la aplican | the pizza I get from here is always fresh and hot it's not messed up and burnt you can see the cheese add it tastes amazing I always tip them because they're worth it and they always make sure my fresh food is fresh and great! | Zero customer service!! | App doesn't work.Wish it would clear off my phone | in order to get your pizza the time you desire it you have to order it at least to be ready an hour before... | No words needed!! 😋😋 | ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ | wouldn't let me use PayPal | good pizza and good app. | it's great not having to stand in line | I use this app so often and never really have problems. I love having this option available. | Quick, easy and delicious! | The app has been crashing lately | everything was good. | It is very easy to order online. | very nice Good quality Pizza and it's awesome that they deliver to my house. it's pretty far away out of town | Tengo 3 semanas queriendo pedir una pizza, la app no funciona. | 1st order quick fast .. | Love this Pizza | App never fails always works. There is only 1 thing wrong most apps you get good reward offers this one has no good reward offers. | I love ❤️ lil Caesars 💓 | The pizza was great. | Great pizza for a good price. Adding an app that is simple to use, has lots of options, and always works make the whole experience even better. This is, hands down, the best food ordering app I've ever used.

Chicago heightc | hooking it up for a Birthday party 🎉 | super easy to use, doesn't take a long time to set up. | App is horrible, and I think I just discovered little Caesars trying to steal from their customers.

Also not able to change profile pic. FEELS LIKE UNSTABLE APP. Try to focus on Amazon Music a bit. Good devs can definitely make it a better app. All we need is not new features. Just improve music recommendations, Make the app smoother (high priority), also fix the bugs. | Should make it so if you follow artists, a playlist generates to play songs from those artists. That would be a nice feature. The user interface is hard to navigate, it should be easier to deselect a song from list that you added by accident or changed your mind about. Also there should be a way to listen to songs like the particular artist not just their album or that artists songs. For instance I wanted to listen to artists like Chris Brown but only his songs played. Un-installed | Music sounds great but just one thing takes about a hour too just play the exact song at that minute in the same hour I'm about too get that motivation feel up too a super 10and no don't play nothing have too close and open and pay for YouTube premium and that's not good for customers like myself and a million others it's not my internet my stuff is all up to par and speed it out of sight super fast geez I Google fi waking me up I almost wanted too kill the basterd for coming in no respect | Easy to use | There is way too many glitches on this app. The audio is so much better, but after a month of use, and dealing with random glitches such as playlists not showing up, downloaded songs are ""not available anymore"" And many other things, all the music is locked and I still have my membership active. I've tried deleting everything resetting everything but the 15 problems this app has persists. Why cant this billion dollar company fix the app? The audio is stunning but the app itself is a headache. | Excellent app with very good collection and user friendly | Access almost all the music. UI makes sense. Better than dotify. | Spotify free tier is better than this. Amazon music stops music automatically, crashes, Low music quality | thank you | Good App. Easy to operate. Hangs a lot. Difficulty in casting music through other Alexa devices. Needs few improvements. | good morning | Absolutely love it! Well done guys and keep up the hard work! | Now it doesn't work at all! | I am getting fed up with amazon music i have been using this app for a while and loved it but now if you have a playlist it randomly takes off songs and does the wrong count of songs you actually have plus i now get random crashes and lags. The crashes are my main issue because it would randomly stop in the middle of a song and crash. pls fix the issues or i will move on to Spotify. If thiese issues are fixed you will once again have a happy customer and i will change my rating. For now tho boo! | Used to be good. But since they try try and force me to pay for the music beyond the Prime service, I barely listen to it anymore. I made up playlist but can't even listen to them anymore. Without paying,basically a waste of time!! | Tragic user interface. Constantly opening in different views, each of which offers misnamed/mislinked jumbles of songs and albums, sorted by recommendations and partial play histories and frequent plays. Just to open to a stable home page would be a big jump in quality, allowing me to organize stuff there. That may just be the impossible dream... Definitely not designed by music lovers and possibly not even by human beings. | At one point, it was quite satisfactory. However, I stopped using it as Prime is considerably more expensive and I have around 800 songs downloaded on my S24 Ultra that would prefer to listen to for free any time. | It has all the music I enjoy. | Good app overall, but far from perfect. This app is constantly being updated which changes many things, such as the live streams with music, which at one point had all live artists, even the smaller ones with less than 20 viewers. Now the only artists that we can watch are popular artists The other issue is the unplayabe songs. I find it very difficult to keep my playlist updated, because random songs are being banned. I find myself needing to sign out and back in constantly, which is annoying. | Great way to listen to music | I remember how good this was in 2022 for prime users. I can't do the basics of a music player anymore outside my own playlists, no going back a song, I can't listen to a full album anymore. instead it randomly shuffles songs that IT THINKS I will like. Sorry but what? that's not how to operate a music platform, as a user I KNOW the music I like, and I want to listen to it. This application is possibly the worst user experience I've had yet. Don't waste time downloading it. | I can't download music anymore and half the time it says it has no network connection | Whenever I try to add songs to play next, the ongoing song repeats | Slow and unreliable | Excellent | Need improvement in interface, my music & Playlist is having lot of snags | I like being able to buy download albums but the ""refresh your music"" button never works. I always have to download the music on my PC and then copy it into my phone | not as good as spotify | It tells you free trial then constantly tries to charge and never get the one month free. Not a very good app but Amazon is the same.. one month free trial then charge constantly. Lucky I'm able to freeze my bank cards | Seems Amazon Music is nothing more than music shared off of other users hard drives.... | I like it | Excellent streaming 👏 | You can only listen to music while the app is open. Quits playing less than a minute when not in the app. App stops working randomly quite frequently. | Terrible app crashes, the application is slow and miserable and never does what I want it to. Tech support no help 2024 still not happy with performance | Very glitchy lately, pick getting error messages when trying to listen to certain things, even after attempting to fix the problem. | If you have downloaded music but no/slow connection you can't open your music tab to play what you have previously downloaded. Many podcasts not available and the latest feature on podcasts does not work at all. I am very disappointed I started with Amazon music but now I'm to ingrained in the infrastructure with Alexa to change services. | New review - they added benefits for prime users so I am a lot happier. I also do not get the error of music no longer available, so good on them for fixing it. Old - Free trial is great, use that to build a like history so Amazon can give you similar music when Free trial is over. Gets a hard 2* since it will give me music no longer available, which usually breaks the app. so I can't skip or reset the Playlist, you have to close the app or chose a different Playlist. | It's taken me a year to rereview this from a one star. It's improved significantly in the year but I still have the rare moment when the app will freeze or the songs won't play to the point I have to uninstall and install it again. I genuinely dread any updates that come out when it's working well for me through fear that the update will break it again. It's far more reliable than it was last year and I enjoy using the app most of my waking hours without issue, so I am content to upgrade to 4* | Way better than my last music app | The App is very user-friendly with a wide variety of music. | Great | Why tf everytime it's hard to put sleep mode... | I absolutely hate the lack of a scroll bar. Would give it 3 stars if it had one. It's beyond stupid that it was ever removed. Adding the fact that if you pay for music unlimited and download your music it doesn't actually download. Uses space on your phone but you're still required to have a data connection to play music. App continually crashes. They don't listen to customer complaints at all. Also settings don't ever change to what you set it to. POS | The Amazon selling point is how all their devices and apps work seamlessly together with Alexa, but they don't. Constantly, without reason, playback devices freeze, connected devices vanish, the app randomly stops, Bluetooth & WiFi just drop, Amazon Music is laughable. Great concept in theory, if only it actually worked. | I can't get past the setup screen. It keeps glitching so bad | Awesome selections, playlists and fidelity! | Crashes, freezes, bugs, poorly organized. My biggest pet peeve is that when I download songs, Amazon music seems to forget what I've downloaded after a period of time. That means that I have to re-download everything to have local music when not connected to the internet. | Ìt,s awsomeɓut why did it sutt off .its not good you're when it off. | i love it | RUBBISH APP I searched up shidu moosa wala (artist) and amozon music said no results found and that's OK until I saw a Playlist of him and then when I would turn on one of his songs it would play a different song | Simply the best music service. Love the integration with Alexa. | I like IT for Free, but I really Can't afford it. | 2 star cos good songs but whenever I pause it goes to the previous podcast I was listening to and only goes away after few months | Love the easy use and functional ability. Love how I can take it with me everywhere I go! | They updated the app on the 11th of March 2024, and it now glitches when playing my playlists. It will show that I have 27 tracks in the list but only list 24 of them. When I go to add the missing songs back, it shows the error for it already being in the list. It happens to random playlists and only fixes itself by logging in and out of the app. I had no issues until now. It's annoying enough that I might switch. Update: it only fixes itself when you delete and redownload. | Love it 😀 😍 ❤️ | Totally frustrated. The music keeps stopping after playing a song or two and I don't know why. I think it's because we don't pay extra for the streaming service. | When I pause from the notification, it starts playing thr last podcast I was listening to. I've tried updating the app. | 💩 App nags for review. As if you need users to tell you how 💩💩💩 your app is. The iPod has an interface a million times more usable than this dumpster fire. Why even bother downloading songs? The 💩 app hides them somewhere in that trash UI so they become completely useless to the end user. Great that we save you trolls some bandwidth. Good for you. This is the ONLY app on my devices that locks up and it does it ALL THE TIME. Learn to code, STOP NAGGING. Fix your damn interface, it SUCKS. | I use the payed service and love it. Crystal clear sound for earbuds and for car use. Beats the heck out of FM radio. | I've loved this app for a long time, but ever since I upgraded my phone to an s24 ultra, the app pauses and plays again, at random times, pretty often. It makes the songs sound like skipping cd's. Pretty disappointed. If it continues I'll cancel my subscription. And go with a different music streaming service | Love it, makes me play list that keep me going through the work day! | It used to be that prime music gave you access to so much music you could listen as you please, then they said a higher paid tier, unlimited. Not as good as it used to be. | Unbelievable how buggy this has become, to the point it's mainly crashing, on a samsung s24 | It loads up my phone with too many songs. It gets slower and slower until I clear the data and then it asks for a review. But at least it works well when it works. Still no progress 2 months later. Update: after 5 months still the same problem as before, but now the ""My Likes"" playlist no longer works. | Good | A good app but so buggy. Even after a complete factory reset, it shows I have downloads on my phone. Requests permission to access SD card to delete downloads which don't exist, also wiped. Untill this bug is sorted (approximately 10 years this bug has existed), I cannot subscribe to Amazon music. | N.O.W Kevin A Goss thank you for your help publishing | Trash. Same as Amazon video and they're marketplace app | Excellent | Absolute scumbags they are now. If you haven't payed for their membership. Then you can't listen to your own songs in your playlist or have them on shuffle. | Keeps upgrading my subscription by posting an add where I would select a song. Predatory | The app never works properly Always buffering and sometimes also stops working altogether. | One issue iv noticed is it doesn't play everything on my playlist when on shuffle, all tracks are downloaded but it plays the same tracks in the same order every time even though it's on shuffle, annoying | Good | Actually 3.5/5. Huge database of music and the ability to watch videos and listen to some podcasts is great too. The search function could be a little less petty with slight typos. Also adding songs and then moving their order in playlists is tricky/finicky in the mobile app and on the desktop. A refresh isn't enough, you have to sign out and in again for your changes to show up. Shame they can't suggest alternative versions when licences run out, too. And Alexa is way too eagerly triggered! | it gives you like a week for free, but even during that free week it won't allow you to download to your phone, only to the app itself. Them after the free week you have to pay and it still won't allow downloads to device. I just assume use Pandora, same thing without charging! | Its getting worse and worse, it literally plays whatever song it wants not the ones you want! | Slow, glitchy, temperamental,storage is a joke, never plays what I want,it's free but what's the point | No se guarda tu última canción reproducida, la aplicación es inservible en playlists... | Randomly deletes songs from Playlists you make, even when you pay for prime music. And Randomly says no songs can be found due to filters and buffers. Fix your app | Absolutely atrocious app. Downloaded songs wont play offline half the time, same 30 songs out of 3000 play when on shuffle. | Not easy to navigate to my favorites and subscribe | This is the best app forever | I download songs. Then next time I open app some download again. I've been struggling to listen to ULTRA HD as they keep downloading in Dolby Atmos | Go to play an Eagles song, and though it says that song is playing, it is actually playing an AC/DC song. I don't even listen to that group. In fact, ever time I try to pla a song, it randomly plays songs from groups I've never listened to. So far, this app is worthless. | Garbage user interface. Not user friendly, it's multiple steps/actions just to pick a song, album, or artist. When you do choose, it doesn't even give you the most popular choices first. You have to search... Annoying, can't wait till I can pay for Spotify again cause Amazon Music is the worst | Amazon music was not a bab app, but it has really started to go downhill. Always have to be connected to use downloaded music, or you get the circle of death (loading circle). The menus are not user-friendly anymore. Wish they would let you set up your own menu layout. I personally don't care to have a share and cast on the main menu. Wish they would put the repeat back on the main menu. There are other setups that are not fun to navigate. | Only works half the time after update. | When it works, I enjoy it immensely. Unfortunately I have to install it at last once a month for it to work correctly. I don't criticize the availability of the music as that's a contract issue, not the app. | It cuts out or shuts off once in a while | Love this app | Podcast keeps stopping | Great selection and simple to use | DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app USED to be a good way to buy and download music for mobile. I could get the files and play them on my player of choice. But ever since an update made since I switched phones you can no longer play the music YOU OWN WHICH YOU PAID FOR WITH YOUR OWN MONEY with anything except the Amazon music app. Anti-consumer, anti-ownership. If I could give this app 0 stars I would. | Doesn't work. Gives you a code that's texted to you. Even if you insert the code they gave you, it will say it is wrong and not verify your account. Can't have it send you another code as it won't work unless you restart the app. Then, the new code won't be accepted either. So, all in all, you can't use the app. | Very good app. I really like having the ability to search nearly any song. But sometimes it's tricky getting to the correct title/artist/version of a song. | App is broken. Won't let me do anything. Just stopped working. Uninstall/Reinstall did nothing. | The app stops after playing just a few songs. Plus it shows an annoying ad every time you start the app. Just play the damn music and stop doing extra.

Do not use this app if you can avoid it | Would not save my information, could not find my reservation | Horrible app. Can't get signed in to view, change or update my reservation. Heck, it won't even let me register on the site or the app. This app is truly hot garbage.

Great experience!! | Super buggy. Repeatedly crashes. | I cannot open the app. It's the only way to pick up the truck. Rep at Uhaul said it isn't true that there is something wrong with the app. That's BS! | Can not sign in. Just says an error occured. Sign in works on web and iPhone app fine.

FIX IT UHAUL!!! | The mobile application is terrible. Had to make several attempts to make reservation. Had to call customer service and discovered there were 4 reservations in my name. Requested cancelation of 3 and confirmation number for the correct one! | An error occurred. Can't log in. Useless | Worked once and now errors. Can't even sign in anymore.

INSECURE APP! DO NOT USE!! [Accurate as of Apr 23, 2024] -- In my first two minutes of using this app it gave me JSON stack traces as errors as Kotlin Toasts AND it was treating passwords like plaintext according to my phone keyboard.

When I tried to return a truck, the app couldn't start the process, and it took several tries to even begin. Once begun, it couldn't detect my location for several tries. Once it detected my location, it wanted me to take photos of the returned truck. However, if I turned my phone to take a picture, the screen would go blank, and I'd have to refresh and start over. The app said returning a truck should take 15 minutes or less, but it took 45 minutes at 1am to finish! | I wanted to pickup truck from them and told him I had to go to San Bernardino and back two trips I need unlimited miles when I returned the truck back they want to charge me for the miles to the rental that i put on the truck and he told me I could pay him later the next day are in payments so I knew something was wrong with them they dent understand me when I picked up the truck so it not my fault they wrote it up wrong so I won't pay for the miles when it was to be unlimedit miles. Well I had | Idk abt the app but I know I'll nvr use U-Haul again. I thought I lost the key but it was in the back. Well I couldn't find the key, w/o being able to drive to the dump. So, I had to call roadside for a locksmith to come out & cut a key, even tho it stays on the web if lose the key to contact the store where it was rented for a spare, they don't have spares. Locksmiths paper said it was$50 to cut but uhaul billed me $315, even tho I paid for ins, it didn't cover anything. | Cannot even login... It's really useless | Great service | Terrible app. Frozen on me several times. Then it would tell me the truck wasn't available when I went to check out. Finally gave up and did it through the website. Come to find out later that it booked a truck for me at two different locations. The owner of the 2nd business where it double booked me said this happens all the time when people use the app. Check in with the app was super slow and clunky. I had to go inside to get the key any way so it would have been faster just to go in . | awesome | Broken. Doesn't let you drop uhaul after hours. You have to call them and wait 45-55 min to talk to someone to do that or get charged a fee. | Just use your mobile browser. This app is super slow and unresponsive. Uhuals mobile team needs to upgrade | V good | Doesnt pull up my active reservation | Works 100% of the time never... | Good | Garbage. Just downloaded. Tried creating a profile twice. Can't even get into my account. Junk. Now I'll wait in line another 30+ mins to return my rental. | Reloads all the time making me repeat steps of the return equipment process constantly. | Good j öi 90rr 9k 9kl.l no 9 | Selected the office in Raleigh NC and the app brought me to Decatur IL every time. Useless | Very detail lots of good information | Can't even log in | Honestly a consistently horrible app. It's hot trash water. Crashes constantly. It often takes longer to reserve a truck on the app than to just walk in the front door and reserve on site. Too many steps, too many pages, too many points of failure. We rent uhaul trucks often (several times/month) for our rental company. The app is by far the worst part of the experience each time. Don't waste your time downloading, go to their website online it's quicker. Would give zero stars if possible. | Tells me I have no order. | Great experience booking the trailer!! Woman was super helpful. The actual rental won't be for a month, but expect no issues based on today's experience. | Garbage. Getting errors trying to just set up my profile. Unintuitive and full of bugs. I'd rather wait on-hold with the 1-800 number. | Very good 👌 | Great | This app is awful. It wouldn't even let me log in to view a reservation. It was not a password issue since I was able to log in to the website using the same credentials. How can they expect to to do everything through the app when it won't even let you log in? | Excellent service and manners of adam | The app is trash I downloaded it and it won't connect any information so it's completely useless to have just go to their website and do everything on their website | Problems with self check out due to pickup location is in an area with poor data signals for verifing correct location | All the time when I try to log in, because the app shows me the text "" an error occurred"" | They are so helpfull when you need them they are there attendad cortis knologeble and the unis are super clean Thank you | Very slow app | It's very hard to navigate this app | Uhaul made it easy to find movers in Dallas and CO. The truck was great, and commiucation with customer service was great. Thanks for making it easy. | Nothing worked, just tons of error codes when I tried to do anything. | Worst app I've seen in a while. Just go online and set up an account. After that call and make a reservation by phone | This app is terrible, it signed me out and now everytime I try to sign back in it signs me in as a different person. The truck drives terrible and speaking to an actual uhaul representative was even more difficult. I DO NOT recommend using uhaul at all. | Had to have human intervention to over come bugs. | When you call, the automated system practically begs you to use the app. Made my reservation for later today. It's still not showing in the app. Awesome. 🙄 | Always an error occurred when trying to log in | ""an error has occurred"" and I'm not the only one getting this error | App is about on par as the rest of the 1stars. Emailed the dev email as well. It's pretty ridiculous that the previous 1stars haven't even been addressed. Fix the app so we can use it. | complete garbage of an app. Do not reply on this for mobile pickup. it has an entirely separate application when you go pickup that takes forever. But then it doesn't even confirm and loops back to the start of th application. I'm literally sitting in my car trying to get this turd of an app to work. Location service works 50% of the time, and this app is scuffed if it doesn't work. overall I would give a negative score if it were possible. | Awesome | Can't sign in... why bother having it? | Highly not recommended very unprofessional and ignorant workers at customer service rude and dumb but will take your money fast if they can Not recommended | I could download the app but couldn't get past the profile set up just kept spinning like refreshing itself... horrible app | Excellent service very clean location very friendly. | Uhaul in flushing Queens on college point Blvd has a theif in charged on their storage units by the way | Can't even login ..something wrong with app.. On the website it's absolutely working fine ... | This app does not allow you to pay on line, if you call still there is noone to answer the phone | Hasn't worked for years | I really liked this place over the year's the only place I known and keep in my mind always. Customer service amazing very professional the rate fair enough for my budgets great communications motivated I can't complaint all I can said decades ago until today excellent services, and I will continue my business there on 22nd Ave and 163rd👍 | App is very slow and difficult to use | Didn't work | Totally useless app. It always says ""an error occurred "" I've un-installed and reinstalled it and log back in. The same message occurs after I put in my password. You're better off using Google. But yet they send you an email or text after you've made a reservation,and it tells you to use the app and actually takes you to the app but can't sign in because "" an error has occured"". Totally a waste of space. | ZERO STARS. APP WILL NOT POST REVIEW WITHOUT A STAR. This app does not work. Difficult to navigate, then pops up w oops, something went wrong. Impossible to check rental in w app that way, and rental place closed before due return time so had to use app or pay $20 fee for store to check in next day. It's a scam! And the review will not post w zero stars!! ZERO STARS | No point in reserving a u haul. I always show up to be told they don't have my reserved truck available and my reservation was moved to a different location then to go there to be told they have nothing available and my reservation was again moved to another location. U haul sucks!!!!!! And no one ever picks up the phone at the locations so you can't call the actual location to confirm before showing up. | Doesn't work. | Very smooth | Nothing works.

I don't want to remake that song...so please help! Anyways....Bandlab is a great app for anyone who is searching. | It's so hard but it good anyways | Great for recording | Absolutely amazing app. Kind of gives off the vibes SoundCloud did when it was in its bloom. How would I get into contact with the developers as I have some questions about accessing my account now that I have a new device? Amazing work guys. | It's a cool up but please work on it. Because it skip's sometimes | 𝚐𝚘𝚘𝚘𝚘𝚍 | thank you bandland now I can master my music | Very nice thank you so much | Yah app ek star ki bhi barabar nahin hai | It is an amazaing DAW software and it is getting better and better day by day. But I request to add some more features like Manual tuning , Duff Instrument & More voice instruments etc. & Update controls. I hope you will definitely add these features soon.. Thankyou ❣️ | Amazing | wow | best application I can recommend for you to create music | I've been trying to use FL studio mobile but it's a bit harder than what I was expecting. Tho the only reason why I'd prefer that than bandlab is that you can edit notes, there's like pitch blend or you can make the keynotes cut and have no echo or something like that. And the part where you can edit the volume so easily, like you don't have to manually change every single note to a specific volume. Tho I'm still using bandlab at the moment beach FLS is too confusing for me, maybe next time. | greatest thing | favorite | It's great but i think that they could use more features and stuff | Very interesting | Very good app | I 😘 ve it got all my stuff from different platforms on one playlist this is cool thank you | Perfect just Perfect | Such a easy to make music | How the hell do you make stuff | I tried to open in studio and it always shows me bandlab has stop, and all my projects are not loading, please can you guys fix it? | It is good to make your own music | Still loving the app making beats weekly an I hope this app stays for as long as possible cause I'll use it for as long as it's available thanks for the fantastic updates to 🤘😎❤️ | This is just my go too | guys Hello everyone I'm new in this whould | GREAT APP | Nmmmmmm nice 🕺🕺 | The best | so very useful💯💙💙 | Thank you, without this app I would have never made a song. | 💎🔥 | I love it, i really do, but i wished there was more looper packs, i barely get new ones, I wish we could get more daily like everyday day. Also the Classic Hip-Hop loop pack has clickbait, the guitar, which I wish it was part of the pack. | I love this ❤️ | Easy to use, sounds good. Perfect to find your sound and learn the recording proces. Very user friendly. | On it everyday great app only problem is that it takes up alot of battery | So good | Great app for beginners | love this program can't wait to get mics for the setup | This app has helped me achieve my dreams in life, I owe almost all my success to this app, the company, investors, collaboraters, this is truly the best app for musicians wise and hopeful to learn. I believe strongly in inspiration and inspiring to be better than I was yesterday, Tomorrow. Thank you bandlab for all that you did, and allow me to do in life . | Best app to use to make music | Superb | Bandlab used to be a big family. It isn't to me anymore after about 10 years of use. Over $200 just so I can use 5 tracks out of 8? I no longer have any other use for bandlab because I only use five tracks at the most. Occasionally 6 if I want to double my vocals although I found a way to use just four tracks. But my music suffers as a result so five tracks for over $200 with no commercials per year. That's a lot of money to remove ads and get my family back as well. I feel like a hostage.🤕😭 | adipoly | I love this app its the real thing❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥 | Very great app | it's to nice but i never use it | I just started using this app a week ago and I'm very excited to learn more. | I would have rate it more but after I use 4 to 5 layer of track it starts glitching, it starts hanging and slowing down that I'm not able to do my vocals in more than 3 layer and it's really disappointing. Otherwise I found it better than any other app | Check me out on bandlab this app is underrated and I really mean that | Wow 😲 amazing app really appreciate it I will like to do so with recording My songs | Great learning all these controls | It's good 😊😊 | amazing | i like it because i can make a songs | The best app for any artist to expand creativity | I use this app to feed myself. | They enable you to do all this from your phone,just think about that, seriously I feel like it's tech we were gifted early. | Bandlab is a good no a absolutely great platform for creating and editing a music. | ghu | personal use to make music | I love this app I use it as a ringtone somehow 😅 😂 | Mama | happy to find this app | im 🟡 | sign me | JJ ES MOYo | cupiri | For me this app is very useful.Thanks. | good | Just mid | We need free guitar spits too 😅 | Best app. i think ise sabhi ko download karna chahiye | I couldn't believe all these creation tools were free but they were. Love you 😘🤟🏼. You are the real hero. | Nice app | why tf you make importing files from drive | This is perfect | nice | Good app when I try record a audio it starts glitching and lagging please fix it | Its the best | Best music app ever. Creations and chat. Amazing amazing. And Amazing | Amazing app! Love the layout! Highly recommend! | It's very helpfull for me I was really sad before using of this when i was use it i really think in mind that now i can do anything thank you bandlab | The Best Experience, Love Getting Lost inside the process with bandlab , the capability the app has is amazing and it's got something for everyone! I can't think of anything I can't do , absolutely love the virtual instruments & the new looper kit for beat making is awesome if you're looking for a fast & easy beat build . They are always updating and adding new tools to improve the app & syncing opportunities for artists when you subscribe on their membership ♡♡♡ 💯 // 🔟 Ur Gonna Love 😍 | Fake | Still new in the game but good experience | This app is pretty good! Though, I would love to see some instruments added. A solo male choir. ""Ooo"" voices. Concert saxophones to hit that sweet jazz feeling. A bass that's styled after Japanese Breakcore. Likewise, a bass for Frenchcore. Definitely a whistle that sounds more like someone whistling. Djembe Drums (Percussion), there's this one army song I wanna make that's based on African culture. And Hi-hats as percussion. That's all 👍 Great app to make music! | good | if you want to become a great music engineer bandlab is definitely the place to be it is millions of us over here enjoying making music making beats so come on and join the bandlab family I promise you you won't be disappointed... | yeah this is a great application. i'm using for mixing up songs and the output I really loving this. | It's so very good app for recording | It gives you An experience When you want to make songs | fire | good | really fun, creating music without any music knowledge. | It's a great app I think | Such a beautiful app for creating quality and high standard music.

It's a lot of fun and they like to check their progress and how they are doing. Makes learning fun highly recommend it! | So, I'm 16 and still love this app. I'd say it's a bit over priced but for all it has to offer (even if just for fun) it is one fantastic app. It's a great app for anybody who wants to feel like a toddler again and if VERY good at teaching children, I've been on this app since I was I think 5 and honestly it's so stimulating I love it. | My son loves this and it helps my wife with at home prek | Update 4-25: issue finally resolved. Adding 2 stars because the app is decent & my daughter liked it. I subscribed during covid & eventually forgot about our subscription. Last week, I saw a new yearly charge on my CC statement. Realizing I hadn't canceled, I contacted them to ask for a refund for the recent advance charge only (I own not canceling before & don't expect to get that back.) It took 2 emails & a 30 min chat online before they issued 50% & ""credits for unused time."" Ridiculous. | We love this learning app but lately the coloring games are not working. | Ryder loves it | 🐦‍⬛👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🪽🪽🪽🪽🪽👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 | I have the program for my 3 year old who will be going into VPK. So far, I am not impressed. There are a lot of ""maze"" games that I don't understand how they could be used for learning. The games are short lived and and not very challenging. Some of the activities are not age/ developmentally appropriate. For instance, on a maze game, my 3yo has to tap on all the number 17s. He doesn't yet recognize that number. He has not even learned number 1-10. Great graphics, though. | Good | I love it Because it has learning path | I can't even sign in me and my kid tried to get in the game and it was very difficult it would be easy if you would add a Google sign in that would be very much easier to do than having to read so many paragraphs to get in the game thank you | I CANT EVEN SIGN IN!!!!!!!!! 3 TIMES!!!!!!!.!!! THATS WHY | It is one of the best experiences You'll ever have for your child. Trust me, it will be your. That's decision that you've ever made | Great | Have to pay before the child gets to test it. | Not really a good app. A lot of irrelevant information and games that teach none of the subject selected. Also, I canceled my subscription a day before they were supposed to charge me, but they still charged me the $12.99 for another month and when contacting Customer Support, they said they can't do anything. So, basically terrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend paying for this app, not only because is irrelevant and not that educational as I thought, but also, because you'll lose money | I love this app! I watched your Youtube channel with all the alphabet songs that are A-U, X. and Z. I love them! My favorite one of them all is the letter J song. I haven't watched V, W, and Y yet. | Great app. What happened to the other apps that went with it for offline? | I bought my children new Android devices to my surprise it is not ABCmouse compatible to this particular device I cannot refund my tablets and I pay ABCmouse up for 1 year and they can't even use it I am so flabbergasted 😭 | I like this I love it | It is SOOOO fun for me and I love all of the themes of the outfits and hair I love I all of the things you can earn to decorate your room and OMG I absolutely love the learning path Infinity out of 10 like love it | 😘🤩😍🥰🤗😊💯 my child loves ❤ it | Horrible app!! It is a scam , do not agree to terms or enter credit card info! I tried to cancel and it won't let me open the app and charged my account before I could cancel my card. The password reset takes you to a reset screen for one second before it goes right back to the app homepage , making it impossible to reset password and get into the app 😡 | Rrfu | Bad costume service... and it won't take my password I even make a new one an it still not taking it like 😒 | Keeps logging me out | I have used this for almost 2 years now. My oldest son loves it. I noticed a difference after we started using it. Lots of books, activities, ect to keep him engaged in learning. When my youngest is old enough, he will be using as well. Update. Had some issues with the app and wasn't able to log on. Staff were very friendly and quickly replied to emails re:status. Very happy with the customer service | I'd canceled ABC mouse in 2020, and kept getting charged annually. Even though i didn't use it for the past couple of years, they refuse to provide a full refund. Only now, my account is completely deactivated, but I still had to pay $60 for 2024. Certainly not worth the frustration of making sure it is fully canceled year after year. | Informative | It is very helpful. | My son Vincent and daughter Amelia love ABCmouse! Amelia is 20 months old and Vincent is 4 years old! They love the learning path! | Constantly freezing haven't been able to use properly without uninstalling and reinstalling time and time again how are we supposed to make progress this has become terrible to use properly | I like it | Highly overrated app, the number of lessons are actually very few /handful no surprise the yearly subscription is discounted to get the money now because unlikely the month/month would work for them. Many other apps there that are better | It's so nice | It's amazing you can get your own house and get money and you can get lots of stuff to is great but it uses internet connection and wen you have no internet it gives you 2 music videos | I can't get the application to even load on my daughter's tablet. | Would not download on my son's tablet. I called customer service. She said to download under google chrome, I did. It still didn't work. She put me on hold. Never came back to the line. I waited 15-18 minutes. Thanks for the customer support 😑 | 😍😋😍 | My 7 year old daughter loves ABCmouse! She loves the learning path! | Good | Do not pay for this service, it is a scam! | Has not worked in weeks yet they won't fix it. Sent 3 tickets on issue now. I've reached just got off chat before posting. Nothing has been done to fix the issue yet still | My kids love it. It's fun and engaging and the reward system definitely helps them want to keep playing! | It is so much fun | Wish I could give more than 1 star, but I can not because the app isn't opening/working! I've paid for a 12 month subscription and my 2 year old has yet to experience all the hype that ABC MOUSE has promoted through advertisements. | Kids got to play it only a little bit and then it wouldn't open and they couldn't play anymore! Paid money for nothing...... | THIS MOUSE KEEPS POPPING UP AND INTERFERES WITH MY GAMES DON'T RECOMMEND IT.. HE IS INTERFERING WITH MY PHONE AND TABLET SO I DON'T LIKE HIM BUT U MIGHT FOR UR KIDS I DON'T HAVE ANY LITTLE ONES BUT IT'S NOT FAIR 😞 HE COMES ON THEN I HAVE TO RESTART MY TABLET..... ENJOY | It keeps freezing on my child he doesn't get anything out of it | Have cancelled my subscription as never used the service and they still continue to take money so after being unable to contact them I am reporting now for fraud | Spongebob square | This app was a favorite of ours but now we can't even get past the splash screen on our Samsung tablet. | Good way of learning for early education. | Greàt app but extremely slow opening r won't open at all. My child likes playing the games and likes learning new things however she seems to not hold an interest for longer than 5 minutes. | Won't work on my devices and yet they won't give a full refund. Ridiculously bad customer service. | Love it! | FUN COOL ME LOVE | constantly crashes and glitches. my daughter gets sick of it glitching and just hands it back to me. so sad. she did learn a lot, but going to cancel. found a better free app that doesn't glitch and still teaches. also a little too much ""fluff"" - coloring pages, videos, and other non-educational material my daughter isn't benefiting from. | This was a really great learning app for my son until it stopped opening up on his tablet and now he can't play at all..Im being charged for an app he can't use! | My daughter and I love this learning app. English is our second language and ABC mause is being a huge difference in the learning of my 3 year old daughter. | CANT OPEN ON APPLE PRODUCTS! Android and Internet only! I pay monthly for what!? For my stepdaughter to use MY workphone to use this app because it gets stuck ""connecting"" and never works on her iPad or on her father's iPhone!? What am I paying for then? Are we supposed to buy her a brand new laptop so she can use your website?? So I'm wasting monthly money on an app my daughter cannot freely use when she needs help or extra homework. | The app is not loading past the landing page. Please fix it asap. | I love it 🤓🥰🤸🏻‍♀️’I'm 9 now and I can't play anymore :( | Stars ABCmouse Kids learning games | Fun and education | ABCmouse is an award-winning Academy for kids ages 2 through 8.Thank you, ABC From M.M | Bought a subscription for ABC mouse and now I can't access it on the tablet! They keep redirecting me to ABC mouse reimagined and they want me to pay again?! | Good app but it's stuck on the yellow page since the update and it's not loading anything. I've subscribed and my daughter cannot use this for about a month. This needs attention . Using Samsung tablet. | I love it for my grandkids | Not functional as of yesterday on my Samsung Tablet. Fix plz!!!!! | My kids can't get into their account anymore and I payed for a year plan | App hasn't worked since I downloaded it and I can't even cancel the subscription. | it showed just a pic of the mouse | Takes forever to load | Don't do it. App cannot be closed without restarting your device. Account cannot be canceled, until you jump through 200 hoops. | No matter how many times I uninstall and install this app, close it down, clear the cache... this app worked 1 time and has frozen ever since. I'm done 😤 This is obviously a known issue (as it's one of the first auto fill suggestions from Google when you type in ""ABCMouse""...ABC Mouse keeps freezing) that I would think you all would want to resolve this... but guess it's just easier to ""blame the user"". | Good but almost never loads. It only opens once a week. | Great app when it functions on the hardware it's installed on. Works on some newer phones. Has issues with some Android platforms on tablets. Freezes up or fails to load. ABCMouse is aware and says it's an Android problem. I'm not sure if they are actively seeking a solution. This is an ongoing issue that has now extended into several months. | We had no issues with program until today. We use a Samsung tablet and it's now stuck on the opening yellow screen with the mouse in the middle. We've uninstalled the app, restarted the tablet, reinstalled the app, and were STILL stuck on the Yellow Screen with the mouse in the middle. It's like the app is frozen and nothing we do gets us beyond this. Extremely frustrating especially since this is subscription service. Can anyone on the app team help us with this issue please? | I HATE that I have to pay for it | Can no longer log into the app. Asks me to solve 1+1 and then brings me back to the sign up page Edit: Contacted customer care and when I finally was connected with someone online, I sat there for 20 minutes without a response after they said Hi. Good to know it's not just the app that suffers from neglect, I'll be cancelling the subscription today. There are other learning apps to try with my kids. | Apsls LL d..d.d Aqq | I can't even get the app to open after downloading. I have uninstalled and reinstalled from the app store and the website for abcmouse and nothing has worked. | I have a special needs son that im trying to work with him on his speech and learning. The game constantly crashes and freezes it just took me 20 minutes or more just to get on. Had to reset my device twice, and uninstall and reinstall. Its a nice app when it actually works. I like the variety of games and subjects. | They will take your money. Poor customer support | Ù Honolulu | I have only been able to use this app 1 day. My son loves it and asks for ""Mouse."" I try to open the app and it is a yellow screen and that's as far as it goes. It very rarely loads so it can be used. | It's a Unch a trash, won't load it's junk. Not worth the time at all | I think the president will do this year by making our gun man and his supporters have a very good point about this issue because they don't know that there goes the problem in a fnf 9th | This app is extremely slow I just installed it and it takes forever wast of money 👎🏼 | Abcmouse | Constantly freezing | Glitches and freezes and sometimes won't load at all. | I hate this app when I try to open it and it gets stuck on the yellow screen with the mouse I didn't get to login to it yet bc of the yellow screen I don't have the patience or time to mess around with it | Recently purchased a year subscription and every time my daughter goes to get on it the app won't load I end up having to uninstall and reinstall just to use it | Ready to learn 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 | Not fun | Terrible App. Pay for 4 kids profiles and we can never get it to open. The company pays so much for advertising but seems they could use that money to increase performance on the app. Reading reviews it almost seems like its on purpose - get famlies to buy into the platform but the application almost NEVER work. Searching for different platforms. The company should be ashamed of themselves, putting out and charging for a product that is subpar, I guess this is the new American way. | This is normally a 5 star but it stopped working on my tablet. It works on my phone but I'd rather not let my child play on my phone.","{""1"":20066,""2"":4238,""3"":4895,""4"":5990,""5"":58030}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$9.95 - $79.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Age of Learning, Inc.","Age+of+Learning,+Inc.","support@abcmouse.com","http://www.abcmouse.com","101 North Brand Blvd, 8th Floor

She always makes sure my orders are right, and she is so pleasant and friendly! Way to go, Daria!! Wendy’s is lucky to have you! (Whenever she is not there, there is ALWAYS something wrong with my order. I realize getting good help is difficult, but if Daria can get it right, the others should be able to get it right also!!) | Unable to log in for weeks now, also unable to sign up. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. | Ordered food, drove 12 minutes to pick it up, told they didn't have the items, Said they would cancel the order, drove home and checked no refund, no chat available, no call available, this is a scam. | Absolute trash | buggy with payment but otherwise bussin 🤣 | NikkiB | love Wendy's but the apps terrible | App is AWESOME | Doe not work took money canceled my order then wouldn't place. Waist of time | Overpowered | Doesn't let you pay | Loving the food and the cookies are so good. | Nice friendly Quick Service. | Don't see an option for no ice. | love the app. love free food! | As of 2:16pm.on newest Android, app is not allowing us to login or place mobile order. | Makes me angry when the app doesn't work when I get to the store. | I've been trying to use this app for 2 months. It doesn't store my card and won't even let me order bc it says server error. | your app is bad have mcdonald's help you with your app | the app doesnt work sometime. it can be real glitchy | App never works | Cannot place mobile orders or load funds to account | 👍 | The operation of app is lying and manipulating. | Gr8 chilis, gr8 salads, gr8 cheeseburgers, gr8 chicken sandwiches. But not a 5 star cause of prices. High pricing would go more often but can't afford that often. | The scan button is no longer there. I cannot add points or use my points. Please fix it. | little buggy but not bad, one love. | interface to enter payment info is poorly placed in the ordering process. | great | absolutely the most painful ordering process of any mobile fast food app ever. | payment is a pain | terrible place to work at food all over and they just throw workers wherever they want to | Work purfucia | Oops, something went wrong!!!!! That all I see when trying to login. This continues to happen, unless app | Crashes every time I try to place an order. Can't view a pending order to inform them I am at the store. | Doesn't work. Will not let me add credit or debit card so I can't use it to order. Deleted it before I even got to use it. | Adding any reward or offer to your card is completely broken, works on online orders only | App doesn't function at all. You can enter in an order but it won't process payment or order at all. | It's not allow onto sign olkk | Could not use rewards would not load selected reward to wallet | mmm nuggets | I would change nothing about it. It is THAT good! I am talking about the app. | How in the hell is there still not an option for Apple Pay, G Pay, or Paypal? | Works good | The app is unusable and requires frequent uninstalling and installing again. I've had this app for 4 years and never knew that points expired. So while the app was unusable for months, I lost almost all my points. The deals are far worse than they used to be. No point of wasting my time on this app anymore. When will this be fixed? | Like it ❤️ | awesome service 👏 | I have been able to get my points, sorta with some effort. The preorder is very misleading now because it tells you your order will be ready in 5 minutes but has another button to MAKE the order, which I did not notice until waiting at the counter for 15 minutes thinking the order was processed. Now I am having to wait another 20 minutes for my food to be made. | Good when it works! Yesterday I got 2 breakfast baconators for the price of one using an in app offer and was able to add on free breakfast potatoes using my points in the same order. Paid $6 for everything. Today the app won't log me in to my account. Keeps saying ""Oops! SOMETHING WENT WRONG!"" Feels like it's on purpose sometimes. | The barcode to scan before ordering your food is not showing up for them to scan to get my points. had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again | Two many bugs! | Whoever approved this new UI design needs to be fired immediately. Its ugly and clunky. Literally, absolutely nothing wrong with it before. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. | The rewards QR code barely works when you need it, and updates seem to cause more problems than they fix. | great food | Worst fast food app ever, can't ever get it to work. Nor will the offers work. Just give me errors. Gonna stick with Arby's and Burger King. | Without a doubt the best mobile food app there is. Great daily offers that blow the competition out of the water (update on new version: daily deals have been revoked. Now on a reward point system which isn't as rewarding for the consumer). Also, PLEASE update the drink menu to show ALL drink options (e.g. Hi-C only shows the punch but I prefer Orange) It's very annoying constantly have to corit when at the location . UPDATE: Unfortunately the app has become increasingly laggy and hangs... | This app is always not working correctly. The last 2 weeks it only shows breakfast no matter the time of day. It makes me go somewhere else to get food. | this app sucks completely. foods great. | The payson Wendy's apparently can't read to get a order right | Most frustrating restaurant app I've used. Paying is a hassle. Won't save Card. | App is terrible please fix | Can't get past the soda part of ordering neither can my husband who has an iPhone. Your app is useless. | easy to use | Trash app. Wont load after i try to sign in with google.. | App is terrible way to damn glitchy | works great | had to order in app to make any offer available. couldn't do in restaurant. | The app is fast and easy to use 👌 | App never wants to work. Worthless | Cannot redeem offers or items from points anymore for use in restaurant. Makes no sense. And it takes your points but offers no way to redeem the food. 2 separe times I went because of tge offers and couldn't even use nor did employees care to help. Wendys is not like it use to be. Sidenote: The new fries are always terrible. Employees just don't care in pasadena, md. | The website is down and the app is having login issues. Always | Payment not working | fast and easy mobile order. | app is hard compared to others | Lately its been getting stuck on the loop with the burger fries and frosty. Kinda sucks because I can't order. | always good deals on the app. $1 small chili on Wednesday! | The app sucks. Doesn't let me get the deals and rewards I have. Hard to get into. | App is pretty good when it actually works. The darn thing won't let me log on at all it's frustrating AF 😭. Can someone help with this | the apps jank and barely works | As a developer this app annoys the heck out of me. I'm lucky if I can get an order to go through. I constantly receive errors. Who built this thing?? | you app buggy af, get on the maccas levels you scrubs | app does not work well. food is great | The Wendy's app is apparently broken 🤷 can't log in/sign up for rewards and this has been days in a row of trying. It's 💯 not my Wi-Fi or data connection that has the problem either | nice an clean | great | great app! | Had a 1 star ⭐ review for the app but it seems that they have fixed the problems. Of course I really like the app when its working. I'm happy it's fixed because I really do like Wendy's breakfast. | who update like to know more like do I have to scan or if payed online | PERFECT | awful app, order failed to use card, javascript error, then failed to find location while in parking lot, then failed to find offers. a boxed trifecta! | very easy | There is no point in using the app if stores aren't allowed to modify orders due to no inventory... Couldn't cancel the out of stock item or cancel the order after they told me to drive forward. | Both on your website and in the mobile app you can't select extra options on your items for ex baconator you can't add bacon, but you can remove and change the amount of ketchup, don't know what the issue is. I hope this is fixed soon as we can't perfect our orders :( | Good app so far. Easy to use. | App does not work 80% of the time. Have to reinstall app multiple times for the app to work. It is too much of a hassle and easier just to order at the restaurant | Not accepting my password and email address. | If less than 1 ⭐ was possible, that's what I would give the Wendy's app. | bla","{""1"":23872,""2"":6605,""3"":15281,""4"":40813,""5"":232304}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Wendy's Int'l., LLC","Wendy's+Int'l.,+LLC","customercare@wendys.com","http://www.wendys.com/app","Digital Marketing

I am using it to ditch my Verizon account but still maintain a static US number. I now only use local SIM cards for data to use GV. No longer any need to maintain a US cellular plan during my endless summers in the Southern Hemisphere. Update 4/26/2024 GV is exceeding my expectations. Now I just need a cheap local SIM card where ever I wander. Permanent US numbers are useful and better still free calls from aboard over the web. | Works good with my tablet. | I signed in using my Google Email. When I tried connecting my phone number to the account, it said that it could not be used. It didn't tell me why or give me any direction as to how to fix it, so I can't use the app. They keep replying that I can link my number but I clearly cannot. Here is the message I receive when trying to link my number: ""This phone number can't be used to sign up for a Google Voice number. Try verifying with another number."" Please give me a number to call to resolve this | Good | Not working at all | Nice for voice calls and texts, voicemail too; excellent for a second number, VoIP or otherwise! | Amazing | Been using for years no problems | Couldn't use my normal call function after installing. Very frustrating. | It's sad when you don't even know your own phone number. How do you gain access of your phone number? Especially when you wasn't even given one. | Reliable Service | thanks for the quick response. everything is working . I had put another number as a link and messed up. Needed a hand to get my regular phone back working. Everything is back in order. thanks for the quick response and once again , this was something I did and corrected. It wasn't you guys , lol, it is an excellent app. once again , this was a mistake on my part not y'all's . thanks | They make you pay, otherwise you will not get a number unless you pay them. This App sucks, Don't download. | This is great. I can use it across all my devices. Works as a 2nd line on my phone. | Everything is going well. | What's better when it forwarded text to my real number. | Been using this since it came out! Can't imagine being without it | Why do I have to RE-CLAIM my Voice number and why are you trying to force me to forward it to my phone number in order to use it? I DON'T WANT IT FORWARDED! This was supposed to be OPTIONAL. I need a separate ring tone and preferably a separate device. The was supposed to make communicating with like online easier when they needed to call me without giving it my phone number, but I don't want to mix up my online calls with my personal call. Maybe next you can add rotary dial. | Bad , I couldn't verified my account | .... ly | All calls are missed calls. I have my phone in my hand, app open, and I get no notification beyond silently seeing another number added to the list of missed calls with no option to have answered or done anything on my end. | I like it. You should make it more fun for people 😉 | There is absolutely no one to get a hold of and it won't let me set up my google voice number. The below response from Google did NOT help. I have followed these instructions a million times. | Google | It's nice to have the option of an alternative number, but my calls didn't always come through and I'd receive voicemails later than when they were left | Voice mail won't work on my new Google Pixel 8 Pro. I used Google Voice for voice mail with transcription emails on several Galaxy phones going back more than ten years, and expected it to work flawlessly on a Google phone. But now, I can't get it to work at all. That's just one issue. I could not listen to old voice mails on the phone, I just got silence from all the saved messages, which I had heard perfectly well on Galaxy phones. On line help and talking with a tech were worthless. | Cool | Easy to use. Have had a number for over a decade. Easy to link to a landline or cell in the US. Does not link to overseas cell phones or landlines. | Doesn't work with all numbers and devices and locations | Am an user for several years, overall very satisfied | Very good phone number app. Simple layout and great. | Excellent program for mobile devices and home desktop use – also great for wi-fi usage. | GREAT APP | This app has served me more than I expected. And Google voice has a mainstay in my life for almost 15 years. Google has never changed my number and even when I didn't have a phone they were there for me to receive important information from family and friend. Thanks Google. We love u | The problem is that am not able to select a gvoice number. After I select a number, I am asked to link it to a real number, I do the 2fa with that, and the real number is linked but I don't see the gvoice number I selected on my account. | It's nice and reliable | So I got a new phone April 10th I've been using this app nonstop it has been fantastic today's date April 24th 2024 | Well. When you can't use your own number to verify it, it's pretty much useless. | Extra phone line works great! Thanks Google. | I love having this phone number. It allows me to separate my personal number from my business line. Oh, and if I get incoming call, I can record. I would love to record the outgoing calls as well though, if you could add that feature. However, overall, I love it. I greatly appreciate and am grateful for this app. | Google Voice is the ONLY reason I use Android instead of iPhone. There are many ways it could be improved but it is still Google's killer service. Still hoping after all these years Google will eventually support receipt of faxes and Caller ID. Newer versions of GV limit access to settings. It defies reason why Google would not offer a GV Wear OS app. | Won't complete setup | This app saves me to use a second phone by the hardware. | Awesome service for having a free backup or spare number! | It needs to verify my number. Perfectly fine. It says that my number can't be used to verify etc. Oh well. | Best ever heard | Great messaging app! It's reliable and the call clarity is good as well. | I'm really enjoying this app | marked a call spam? was a local number. had an important voicemail missed | Edit: down to 1 star. The audio quality has declined, and voice no longer rings when someone calls me. It was far better when it integrated with hangouts and Gmail 7 years ago. | Amazing 😍 | Doesn't seem to work with non-US phones. So if you're overseas, using a foreign SIM, it's useless. Bad as it is, at least Skype works with international phones. | Worse google app ever | The experience has been meh for a while. Where's the floating head feature? Can't send or receive videos. No sent or received notifications. Needs all the features of Google Messages. Also should have the option of being the default messaging app. | Terriff | Just started to use it recently, and was spot on each time. | Not bad, Google! ...Not bad.. | I liked Voice because it allowed me to easily search through old messages. But now the search function is almost worthless since it only pulls up one message and not the context around the message. The ability to search messages is why I switched over to Voice. It's why I had Messages before Voice, and Google has taken away the ability to search for those, too. They keep taking the functional apps they buy and ruining them, just like the apps they develop. | It has worked great until this week it has been dropping calls and also another call coming threw it causes crashes | Calls don't go through | Good expectation keep improving ❤️‍🩹 | Good | Love this app!! | It works | RCS support is desperately needed. | I can't call | Good | Used to mB a 5⭐ but no it allot of ppl b are not getting my mesgs | Seamless transitions from other device and from app to app to upgrade..s. There was no data loss | No RCS... Why? | Love it ! | 👍 | Excellent for my needs | Awesome | Love this app | Love it | It allows me to use my former USA number here in The Philippines🇵🇭 on wifi for free! | Great experience. I have never had any issues. Google has been and still is my favorite. | Vary Good 👍 😊. | Love it | Wonderful service | Great service! | I use the service many years. Never been disappointed. Thank you, Google Voice | Seriously disappointed, my phones voice mail cannot update cause the phone is so old it refuses to. I needed an add on voice mail for just one day to receive and extremely important news and the google voice did absolutely nothing. If you really want to waste your data and your time this app is for you. I DO NOT recommend. | Thank You for replying. I'm just bummed because I don't want to give my real cp# only to inundated with spammer or marketing calls. Useless when trying to receive security codes from different accounts. Even with my own wifi, it doesn't send it until after the fact when I end up using my email for security code instead. | Decent, could be better | Best ever | Great 👍 | I can't send message in my Google voice I don't know why | It's a great service with a slightly clunky app. Now and then it gets done solid polish, then lingers a while. I wish I could tell it to stop asking me to link my phone's number and always let me place calls over WiFi and cell data. It's fickle about whether that's allowed while you have a cell data connection. | Good and better to use | Worst app won't work in India | Good | Real good","{""1"":25650,""2"":9108,""3"":17355,""4"":48455,""5"":245432}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Google LLC","5700313618786177705","apps-help@google.com","http://www.google.com/voice","1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043","http://www.google.com/policies/privacy","5700313618786177705","Communication","COMMUNICATION","[{""name"":""Communication"",""id"":""COMMUNICATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gf8ufuFbtfXO5Y6JuZjnG0iIpZh21zNTqZ5aiAXO8mA38mvXzY-1s27FWbGlp51paQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YAcWQVBN8tcl5swm5qEeuwP8zMUNXRd6E0yN_gEVn4lYX7ern9S_4VZqRI6DeRhidw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-Eo8pCXJ9ofkZsS605-4uXBXbOjCLMOI2THcPhTlmmJ5AUtOlV_ejWpwmxdnobwg-xg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/T_6aiD-fKmn91V8Hqm2WNGlxQfonKKfUm9u0pQBzsgg29QFnszI0tCcKLLwl3TDQtG0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yTSD6lM63edhAl0bhQdKiE9hC7OIHgzBxMX2PSnwlW248e7GHvsjgZjIuuhicvMsnAjP"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aIRH5E41KH1pNSsWfHgU7i02_UHDFYSG621aS9Rc-OBjLStfeTEyRJIzOQp6Ncojbz8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rJrkcEsdQa7_AozmzGpy9CPTy-GKKFENfBRdUQwXLdI0tSbYSMsng0C19CdzYmQM-Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iWaKOLYdmOKqLObx3EkBc71BPdkUdNNC__ry6E7rcznxj4CfD6gdcPCnbUJqfa1rnOY""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,,1713803446000,"VARY","• Stability and performance improvements","[null]",false,false,false,"com.google.android.apps.googlevoice","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice&hl=en&gl=US"

It doesn't take a password, just sends me an email with a bunch of links that don't work. I tried logging in, but the link just downloaded the .png of the button. Tried to contact support and it didn't work either. Tried multiple browsers and network connections. | Ordered 2 buckets of sweet lightning and the app changed them to Pepsi after ordering. This app is also a pain to use sometimes please fix this | Good | Would not load. | This app is HORRIBLE! I placed an online pickup order. The app changed my location to the next town over. I drive 20 minutes to get there and the store closed early and didn't have any food despite confirming the app order. The employee was extremely rude. I lost $33 an hour of my time and gas for nothing. I will NEVER use this app again and KFC has lost my business for good. | Good | Won't let me log in, just sits there. Useless app | So basically we was on the app and we tried to press order, until it started to kick us out multiple times. | very efficient | App doesn't update your current location. Easy to order from the previous location you ordered from. But can cause orders by mistake if you are ordering from a different KFC location which leads to wasted food and a financial hit. Fox this please. | Huge disconnect in the time when they say it's ready and when it actually is | Very good | You waive your right to take KFC to court by using this app. | Offering PayPal as an additional payment method would be nice. | ordered food and when I got there my order had not gone thru | My apps are hacked and I need your help! | The app restarts when u try to pay for it 8 PC chicken only special runs.in a.loop can't order it | Cancelled my quick pick up order when I arrived with no immediate explanation. Already had to wait to be helped at all as the counter person was busy. Then I had to reorder at the kiosk just to get my food and lost my discount. Completely defeats the purpose of ordering ahead and using the app and adds unnecessary frustration. | Prices are outrageous and very inconsistent store to store AND in the app. You are stuck with the sides that are shown in the deals now. No one in my house eats Cole slaw and nor KFC anymore. Service in stores is usually terrible and I was hoping this would help. Too little too late. | Hardly ever works | Whenever I want to use an special offer or deals it's saying I can not combine which my cart is empty. I'm missing out on free food or deals and having to pay regular price. This has to be fixed | The ordering works fine for me but despite having the necessary points I'm unable to redeem any rewards | Will not let me place an order! My sister's app stopped working, so I downloaded it on my phone and got 2 orders before mine stopped working as well. It says my payment is invalid even though I can use that payment other places with no problem. Extremely frustrating | Has raised prices and cut chicken into or smaller chicks. It's ok food, chicken is good, instant potatoes, canned gravy, coleslaw is good, baked beans needs my touch, green beans from a can just heated. They should be the number one place for wings, and there not. Why aren't they taking advantage of being the best chicken place. Oh they offer wings but they really need to hit this market and have a variety and quantities for parties, holidays, the very best THIER is, at a fair price | Why does this app not use a password like every other app known to man? I deliberately do not have e-mail on my phone. All of my e-mails go to a server on my laptop. | I tried to use a coupon, and as soon as I added it, it vanished. I then tried to use a different coupon, and it kept giving me an error message. I'm not going to order if the coupons are not going to work. | Trash app cannot login and deal redeem does not work. | I have ordered twice, and the system canceled my order. Both times, I paid in advance, and payment was processed with no issues. | Once they bringsomething out, then they remove it, sucks | Great service and friendly crew thanks | 0000 pop | Honestly can't remember one time tany of the deals actually worked. Usually the site will just crash, not load when you're close, or just fail to load | So you can order. You can order a family meal choose regular or crispy but no choice for mixed or dark meat. That's poor design. If you order a combo you can pick the meat but you cant pick the size of drink. So you can't even properly order. Update: they added rewards which Is nice. But the store that I use says currently unavailable for mobile order like half the time I try and you can't use your receipt to get rewards so I just generally go somewhere else.🤷‍♀️ Edit: offers no longer redeem. | Deals won't load | Hard to get into, I had to send three links before it actually worked. I can't get my order for delivery because it continually sends me to link that has expired due to it being old. | Kodak Black kfc gives 5 stars | won't let me add free nuggets deal | The kfc near me doesn't accept online orders so the app has no value. Popeyes is better anyway | app will not load offers | Half the locations don't work on the app, and whenever there's a ""free"" offer on anything it never works. I swear they advertise ""free"" food for a limited time and purposefully use a broken link so you can never actually take advantage of the free offer. Will not eat at KFC period let alone use this broken app until they stop doing dubious bs like this. | Garbage app. Anytime you want to order regular food it works. Want to use a promotion? Have fun looking at the loading screen forever. | I didn't receive my rewards points after ordering from the app. Already contacted you guys on April 13th, case #02077345. In fact, all my points disappeared for no good reason, which is why I contacted KFC. It's almost a week now and not a peep from KFC, and for some reason, the points I had accumulated suddenly reappeared except for my 100 points from my latest order...wth?! | App works great until it takes all your rewards points away for no reason. Today i made a $229 purchase for the guys at work and that brought me to over 2698 pts. They mysteriously disappeared. (And they weren't applied to my purchase, btw). And there doesn't seem to be a way to contact them anywhere in the app. | The app is TRASH !!! | Won't let me redeem rewards. | Delicious. | This is the slowest app I've ever tried using. Only good thing about it is seeing store locations and menu. Trying to use it beyond that is painfully slow. I'll stick with Google. | App doesn't work. It lets me log in but nothing shows up in any menu when I try to order. | 3 orders and they messed up my orders 3 times in a row, missing items, etc. | Worse kfc is macclenny fl | Order got a call from location they can't make my order. I am not able to cancel my order. Gave me an option to change order to another loction. When to other location. They said they never got the order. Don't use the the app and save yourself the headache. | 4 orders made on app and my points still haven't moved from 0 | Junk app! Never able to log in. The email link never worked, keep looping back. Uninstalled! | Always requires update,.loses points getting old. Every single time you open it it want to update. Then it loses logins, and even if it logs in it loses the points | Happy my store FINALLY can be accessed via the App. | This app is a joke!! I am not sure why they are so behind in app capabilities! I wish I could give zero stars! | All my points disappeared I never used them and they are gone | App freezes everytime I open. | I love 💟😘 this favorite restaurant 💓💗🍩💞🌄great fries and chicken 🍗 and milkshakes and food desserts and ice cream | We've called their 1-800 number and we've tried multiple payment methods and the app and going online doesn't work. | Horrible. Wrong order, wrong sauces and charged me $10 for something that should have been included . I'd like some small renumeration. | Absolutely worthless app. Never works, constantly glitching, and it says there's an issue with my cards but ONLY when I am redeeming deals. This happens so frequently that it seems very purposely to only happen when I'm redeeming deals and there's no issue with my cards when I'm paying full price. Very annoyed. | Just kept shutting down. Flawed and glitches and the time | Can't use the app. Won't open. | Took away all my points. Noway to get customer service. Yall food already overpriced. | Please improve the app to allow MIX of original and extra crispy! Let me use coupons I get in the mail, on the app!! I use the app so my chicken is ready, if I wait till I get to the store, it can take forever, but I can get a mix and use a coupon | Months ago you had a 8pcs for 10bucks now you have a 12pcs for 26 dollars, REALLY? BRING BACK THE 8PCS FOR 10BUCKS PLEASE 🙏 😢. | Tried to use a coupon and there was no place to put in code, had to order at the counter. | Would be nice,to see where I can order please and thank you | Absolutely loveeeee KFC! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🧁😋🍗🍗🍗 | Hi beautiful people I'm still a fan of our KFC in our town been a loyal customer throughout the weeks I get there deals they offer let me tell you my experience in visiting trying there tasty offers with the economy high a very high priceses going all time high we sticking to there special food values offers I would still give you my vote for KFC 🍗 FOOD CHICKEN RECIPES THAT do change a little bit of the original back in the days til now 2024 that nothing compares food from the past being made | Is this store now open | Half the :offers"" don't work. I get mad and uninstall once in awhilenwithoutnordering for months afterwards | All the options are well organized | It was very good | My rewards aren't showing and I have like 947 points ! Don't be cheap . Give us what we have earned! | I'm addicted to those 11 herbs and spices!!!!! | Great fresh food ! | Everytime I try to put my card in, the app closes. Won't let me check out. | Good for me Yes Love it | Chicken 🐔 is always too Salty 🧂, I can't eat of the Chicken. Cut out so much Salt 🧂. | I was about to order, and I was forced to update the app. After the update, all my reward points disappeared (996 points). I will NOT be ordering KFC until my reward points return! | Awesome 💯😎 | YALL HAVE GOTTEN ENTIRELY TOO EXPENSIVE SUCH A SHAME I LOVE UR RESTAURANT HOWEVER IM DISABLED AND CANT AFFORD VERY MUCH AT ALL DEFINITELY NOT UR RESTAURANT ANY LONGER | Good | Great 👌 | Garbage. Was able to use it for a few weeks. Now it won't even accept any form of payment. Uninstalled, reinstalled, used my girlfriends phone, her debit card. Nothing works. What a waste | Just order like normalcor better yet go to one of the backjillion other chicken resturants. Almost all of the stores are franchisees that dont accept the coupons. | It might be ok if what you want to order is there. I was unable to order a 2 piece with coleslaw. It's not one of the options. Guess I'm going to BK. | Limited: you need to be ready to order before a price is given. | Was very dissatisfied with the quality of the food | Always been fresh and on time but last 2no ice left in pip | Cant even open it | Can't even log into account. There is no password, the only option is to send an e-mail confirmation. I accepted the confirmation and it does nothing with no other alternative to log in. Guess there are better restaurants to visit anyways. | To many updates this is the third in so many months. Plus half the offers are not honored by my local restaurant | GARBAGE! | Persistent popup ads in other aps | Edit April 24: STILL useless: still cannot submit receipt to get credit for in-store receipts. Sad, because KFC has Good Spicy Chicken now!! Original Comment Dec 23: Useless if none of the stores in your area accept orders through the app, Nor can you redeem in-store purchase receipts! This app is WAY too insistant on ""Every Order Must Go Through Me!"" Carl's Jr has tastier and cheaper tenders anyway. | The app is not giving me my reward points","{""1"":7949,""2"":1219,""3"":1269,""4"":1519,""5"":8928}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","KFC US","KFC+US","KFCMobileTeam@yum.com","https://www.kfc.com",,"https://www.kfc.com/privacy-policy","KFC+US","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/33kb-EuCpEtNdaMLGtxgpKDDlQUp392Xye8TfEwNwnmGNYo-TqSWPKM5cu5nlCpyYQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4dGPeF2f5KgXqpPt1gu8tZUBDTqAeOFjvhhKmQ72zU6-ad-DOw6D4vaHp3AYgz6TXD8","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/826gUF063msEaATne3RgKkqrHzJ6Bj91bYpbxSBE3aJncxWgBzSCyky8PjzuJ3mRoGA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/o_lpwroyW2AkF2lvmboAV-2C3MP9e1LAKLYDs_X48lasBIdg4BcfF_ha8ehCDzEGeY4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NZSgTC6g6YbsGJhyqxxg37mYp2moFwRSssKsdAZzP-vuEVKBJXN3EZaC7r9Zak7yu-4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IuZ1kXCMoh11CFjlgyq7aDZ4ePGPTdjabO30gGBihu-S7YWe1pQRfp8dF4KyerzqW84"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AQeOgh4XS3cfGu9QZZkpl500PeyWMeers_ERGnM-Hwhtw6D7Q-2cgXwIX7YHHNLMRdqR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DrResX7tLwnEZTM44kxvg4K3Kws-g69ZDn2FuxPKfpaPFlDni-Cu5iJCRKcBnL8GRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/frq-hPYpkAvZS9jImp1yOD19wU4u0xb84mFwJAQbBN844CbqqSrAgzbJyu85P1GfBbY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rEUabgpa-Q0WzYZupzOvoBeqbQLQDdng9dmufG5Rxc7QOq0DKWEujUzkeLcdm8nbXxRV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gDbDOECcCnrac9GCRFDXU4ec7K270HbwbgK73LYGT0B0GTgGfv1WIilCgE_6MVhKfck"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cAbLSvK1EHaDKLDrk1z3E4N_0raLV46AEhgjQJrYfLWMbRYHia3hceiFWJu9MXXGovCY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H88VJiOLYPWF7YLnjL8CQRdbkoNMpzV6sYhMHLlXqWUIsDlYgtaV-8sD39CXjoCIp1gq"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UI_fn3GbRSuUQjNUPGQ7rBRo_V4uoxasGNy2DjspMX3yi9qUFgxOaeR2RSWkTgP06kwi"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1Ne4y2NdLoblGNCeAV2PIDghuu57Vo4_BzuWDpLwU6sZdiV7VJPMcJKqyib1dxZpn9id"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s7qIJ4yET0cSGJzW4_7znp4vBZrhaqI8vcYBiSYXoDrdhuvUA4z8ZkgFY_ZZI6lDXTs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qdc-gPG6__eqHqw84uqy3DFrIbQ6UCBR2K937yzlJUGqK3lGTENXmt1Xd1eINAzefCI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GgXb-7ZbULo7Pw0VUwPBl_XxSpo6x4SGxpIovLHniyJzacb2_z0wLze9ItKN-jeR6to"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/txtrhBRtUj-uNeTsrKuWV4-XA7wL197rh4EJW5-6QXpeVCqGCUkGynDstNARw2qUogUY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nUSVGcvtGcJBjSbwxI-IX54P8gCn4LXNtnE8EC4Mm58DTE_tuF9o6RlZuM_H__X7ki-n""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Feb 12, 2021",1713791156000,"2024.4.0","New Features: <br>One-Tap Add to Bag allows quick addition of recommended items. <br>Direct Rewards Access facilitates easy navigation to Rewards and Offers. <br>Improved Quantity Picker for better control. <br>Points in Order History to track earned and used points. <br>Enjoy a fresh visual style with the new Chip Style. <br> <br>UI Enhancements include Smoother Navigation and Optimized Terms &amp; Conditions layout. <br> <br>Performance enhancements and fixes ensure smoother browsing.

Really fun. The problem is you can create and join clubs, and you can also post stuff on those clubs. So people post innapropiete pictures of girls and boys, they also post s×x videos, and write mean comments on peoples pics, like, "" ew your ugly"" or "" that's not you, stop lying"". I'm also worried that people are posting pictures of other people, pretending that is them, and they deny it! Please fix this problem. | Its so bad and fake | Zepeto please I love this game I'm playing this from 3 years please give me zems please 🥺 | This app is good | My god!

And this problem is about ""candy slime"". I can't use this feature any more. Even after I use vpn this don't work and keep telling that ""this feature is not available in your country"". Please fix this on. This feature is the only way we can grab some zems in a fair way.

But the problem is, the items is to EXPENSIVE, remember, the games is not just full with teenage or adult but kid's who CAN'T afford the zems with their money! Bring back cheap items and don't be selfish. You keep ignoring everyone comments about it. Change the name to ZEMPETO if you keep ignoring it. Not EVERYONE can afford the zems all day all time. Have a nice day :) ! | It did not have a 'next' button when I create a video. | It's a great app but there's some people cussing and I don't like that but some people are really nice so you should totally get the app but be careful. Don't tell anybody else where you live where they're going to hunt you down I don't know if they're going to but they might well I hope you have fun on the app if you get it. Bye! There's actually some creepy things on here. 😁🥺🫠 Have fun bye | I love it. | It's not working | good game aka best game | ✨️ | I love this game u can go viral on yt when u upload these an you can also decorate your avatar amazing | nice | Plssssss give me zems and coins plssssssss | itws good but kinda glithching 😄 | Gak guna banget ngelag bgt lagi tuh,,,player nya toxic lho | It's an awesome game | Really hate it have lot of bugs and lags | Love it so much | This is the best app ever | Tis is is the best I have 100k following me thx for this game 🎮 🙌🏾 ☺️ 🙏🏾 💙 👌🏾 | Whenever I want to play A game it would take me out of it.

PLEASE FIX THIS | I can't download the app, i really need to install it for school. | Your game is good | Nise | Bad it should have games for everyone to play like kids, aldut, even family. | Good game some ads but not that many | สนุกมากแม่ | Very disappointed. I really wanted to play this game with my sisters but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it work! My phone refuses to install the app and I don't why. Now that may not be the developer's fault but their website sure is. The site does not allow you to create an account, and even worse, you can't do anything with your profile on it, only play worlds and use the creator studio. It seems the site is only there to direct people to the app which I can't install 😭 | Lots of kids are using the app, making inappropriate content. Live streams get out of hand. People are incredibly mean. Everything is very expensive, and it's hard to earn the game currency. Good app to make little skits with characters though. It isn't all bad... | so goood mawh mawh mawh | So so! | Kid friendly 🥰 | I've been on this app for over a year even though there some bad people on it this is still over all a amazing app I know I've spent at least over 200$ on this app😍 | I love this app ♥️ | Awesome game I get so many likes on my posts because of upgrading my outfits and looks. 100% recommend | Heat filled | Its amasing and its so fun u should try it 👍👍P | amazing | This sucks...my 5 year old sis made a boyfriend and he was 19... | Zpt pls let me play this game everytime i try to it says device not allowed and its my first time and all my friends play it","{""1"":239574,""2"":67913,""3"":129674,""4"":255833,""5"":1825657}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.39 - $190.99 per item","7.0","7.0","VARY","Naver Z Corporation","Naver+Z+Corporation","googleplay@zepeto.me","https://zepeto.me/","7F, 131, Bundangnaegok-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea","https://support.zepeto.me/hc/articles/360050411493-Privacy-Policy","Naver+Z+Corporation","Entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","[{""name"":""Entertainment"",""id"":""ENTERTAINMENT""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eFeqVnAfAY71ui-SU8rHncGfkcgH2atN74cvlxqliDJKhrIwxdm6iKeVVw_fKgyiXzc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VVNcBpkWH88fltOTh-paB3Km1b3eMn_JQEV4kbiLmRisY0o58WdQNlwSvb-z7-RlwB0","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hsECW2Oa55jVinlWqL5XRToX1cIOO45CFaqWza9ob-m5524OXllK8SEwMstovn7QnKo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nnJ4C4R-2RJ4fRuNau1gJ2Es2igxOdFghM3MamWnAZgT81ejZKPej5ysu2iIDQey6Vo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H8AAPYUiNFaWLjkwV4unmJQedey1Ye3ac8nUh9yfmjNGKOV3Pmc3vkfP_PqyqkE8pNBE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AknpL1fBnYseO_yGFQ-7wI5NY0wf0qla_RI7Z0sRdBXXl7xsz_sMIiL8-EJctmjLCQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZECkXR6g7y9F6RvGmghLnq0S9SM6vO2SIqTB-a7e2nWQ66L1uWhsE0P481G68e5iqg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2DprKyW-caRwhIAruVEXarVk3I7Z8sFY4TcJhG65sxEBxGlZJTHGFT7r9G13Ln0J_KQ""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLqMcwJ_2p0?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VVNcBpkWH88fltOTh-paB3Km1b3eMn_JQEV4kbiLmRisY0o58WdQNlwSvb-z7-RlwB0",,"Teen",,true,"Aug 30, 2018",1712835275000,"3.52.000","ZEPETO just got better!<br>- You can use ‘Hair on/off’ function now!<br>- New package products, which include paid features such as avatar slots and Custom PRO, have been released.<br>- We&#39;ve fixed bugs and improved usability to make ZEPETO even better.<br><br>See you in ZEPETO today!","[null]",false,false,false,"me.zepeto.main","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zepeto.main&hl=en&gl=US"

I purchased because my car was broken into a few times...but it rarely alerts me if someone is outside...very disappointed | Trying to get added onto my girlfriends account and get camera access. Downloaded the app and set up an account. It will not let me log in. It redirects me to a Google Chrome screen in the ring app saying my browser isn't supported. Using the ring website I have access and it is working. But the app is not letting me log in or do anything. | Best investment I've ever made to get a Ring camera | DONT BUY ANYTHING THATS RING/GOOGLE!! TYPICAL!!! As you notice Ring has upped their yearly price from $40 to $50 a year per device!!!! Do not buy anything that's Ring!!! I will buy from another company and not be forced into such a humongous price hike and throw the 3 cameras I have out in the trash where they belong!!!! Screw Google. Send a message to Ring/Google, don't re-up your subscription. Tell them where to go! Just another company that believes people will pay because they have too!! | As per their instructions we need to update and go to the recommended browsers such as Google, Foxfire. None of those are working it's still giving the same error please offer a fix. | I come back 2 years later and the app is still garbage. I cant even log in because my pixel's browser isn't supported? You've got to be joking. It tells me to open in the app when I'M ACTIVELY IN THE APP. | How about a swipe left or right to go to other cameras when viewing one of the cameras? | Fantastic purchase highly recommend | Whatever changed has rendered app & equipment useless. My return window with shmamazon closed. App worked a few weeks, started getting buggy. I uninstalled the app to get a fresh start, haven't been able to login since. I get the ""unsupported browser"" notification error. Updated: last ditch effort after writing this review I uninstalled and installed again and the app started working. From a 1 to a 2 because I can at least access the app. Too soon to comment on function. | Ring alarm and cameras are brill thanks | App keep logging me out | Device Health Report keeps loading the Help and Support page. Looks like an issue since 2019 according to forums. Also, some of the videos that launches automatically are very loud. | Doesn't make sounds when someone goes near camera, push button is ok, wish it would make a sound on the phone without pushing the button | Don't have a plate to install my ring | App continually does not.let me sign in tech support unable to fix going on for several weeks | Way too many notifications even when turned off. Doesn't work well unless you pay the outrageous subscription price | It's getting better as I learn how to access it. | App not giving notifications. I have my settings in both phone and all to send them, but I get none. Is this a known issue?? | I love my camera. I could see even when the wind blows any garbage * Across my lawn. | I am having issues with the latest update where my motion dection keeps turning off. This is not helpful since I am monitoring an empty property for potential break-ins. | I never get alerts on my phone when someone rings the doorbell. I have double and triple checked all the settings and try ALL the troubleshooting shooting steps. I even pay for the monthly subscription. Absolute garbage that it doesn't even do its basic function. | Cannot open with browser. Even though I could two days ago on same device and same browser. Support blames Google. Google blames Ring. Is there no work around? Nothing online helps. I've tried resetting app and phone, disabling browser. Tried three other browsers. Someone please help. | Love this app. I can see everything happening at home at anytime. | There is a longer delay since the update. I use to get notifications as soon as the ring went off but now with the update it takes several minutes. | Having major issues logging in. I Uninstalled the app. And it won't allow me to even log in when I reinstalled it | The app is never ready to use. It constantly needs to be killed and restarted. I can't use it to disarm the the system when I get home because it never starts up. It needs to be killed from Settings at least one time if not more than that, every time I attempt to use it. I can't/don't use it to arm the system because it never starts up. Really makes having the entire ring system not worth it. Running on Pixel 6 Pro with Android 14 and all the latest security updates. App is up to date as well. | I keep getting browser not supported open in app messages but I AM IN THE APP. I try a different browser, doesn't work. I have JavaScript and cookies enabled. How am I supposed to set up my cameras? Give me my subscription cost back if I can't use it | I had the ring app installed on my sanding galaxy z fold 4 working but the audio from a new floodlight cam pro has loud static noise in all the videos. so I uninstalled the ring app to try reinstalling it. but I reinstalled the app and try to log in, it says to open your browser menu and select ""open in app"".. but it does not work! in Chrome browser there is no such option. In Firefox browser the option does show up, but when I click on it all it does is go back to the browser page. BAD! | Well, just last month, I was happy with Ring. Today, I am searching for another camera and service since Ring is no longer supported using my Samsung S21, the same phone I've been using. I uninstalled and reinstalled and same thing. I refuse to pay for something I can't use. | Notifications WILL NOT pop up on my phone when someone is in front of camera! Totally defeats the purpose of having this device | Wouldn't even let me sign in gave a 406 forbidden error message 🤬 | Good 👍🏻 | Was really good until I got a new phone samsung galaxy s24 ultra, now it's saying the browser isn't supported | What happened to Google Home compatibility? I specifically bought my Ring cameras because I was told Ring was compatible, from multiple sources. I finally get all of Ring devices setup, go to integrate them, and bupkis. The cameras work great, but I could have bought something a lot less expensive, with full mobility instead of stationary, if I didn't care about Google Home compatibility. Fix this, please! | Since last update to my OnePlus, on the 27th march, even though my device is set up properly, I do not get any audible alert when someone rings the doorbell. I can hear the bell only from the plugged in chime. | Unable to even log in. I enter my credentials, I enter the two-step verification code that is texted to me, then I'm told that the browser is not supported and I need to hit the menu icon in the top-right corner and select open ring app. When I do that, there is no option to open the Ring app. I tried updating my browser, restarting my phone, checking for updates. Nothing works. Waste of money. | Works really well. | They don't let me log in my account despite I put the verification code multiple times | After I paid it, it worked perfectly. A few days later, it doesn't work with the detection nor the notifications. I removed the app, and now I can't access it, and the chat support doesn't work, too. This is going into a scam mode... probably the best is to cancel the payments too | Got a new phone and the app is not working | Why is the app no longer supported on a new phone/browser? | Doesn't connect or let you share with another person | Not impressed with the lousy birds eye view that doesn't actually show anything. | It says the browser is unsupported abd i use chrome | Good and clear | Shite | Living room keeps going off line | you have to pay for the camera and then pay monthly to use it is super greedy. I just needed something to monitor my kids seizures and was told this was a good product. it's definitely not | CONNECT/ DISCONNECT/CONNECT, WHAT THE HECK IS UP RING?? AND YES MY WIFI IS FINE!! OVER THE YEARS THIS RING SERVICE HAS GOTTEN SO BAD. | Good updates by neighbors. Well wishes and prayers to Jesus in support of those in the community in need. Public Service announcements of events and opportunities. | Good. | Good for class action lawsuits. Bad for privacy. Ring will give your data to the government without approval or even notification. Don't trust amazon to do the right thing. | Just bought a ring cam and downloaded the app. Doesn't work. I've updated Firefox still won't connect. 4/25/2024 | Browser not supported. It's chrome. | Don't take. Pictures at time ,don't ring not happy | App freezes record delays too many issues App doesn't support browser check everything and still don't work. I paid too much for this camera for the app not to work plus I pay a subscription to access the app I want my money refunded for the time I can't log on because a default in the ring app. This company needs to care about their customers a little bit more. Terrible service 😑 don't BUY Ring its not reliable. RING NEEDS TO FIX THEIR STUPID APP AND STOP GIVING PEOPLE WHO PAY THE RUN AROUND | In response to the developer because apparently I was not clear when I said that I have done all troubleshooting multiple times. My phone software is updated, android 14. The app software is updated. My notifications settings are set to allow all notifications and sounds. I have reset my phone, deleted cache and data, re-installed the app, rebooted the app, and reset the door bell MULTIPLE TIMES. The app still toggles off motion alerts and even though my wifi signal is strong it still don't work | Way too much lag time between events and notifications. | Great quality product, reliable and easy to use. Your eyes and ears at home when you're not there. Total peace of mind product. | Not able to download | Had my Ring doorbell for a while. I've noticed less sensitivity and slower notification time. This past update has not improved it. | Absolutely wonderful you see if anyone about, and you don't miss a delivery, also it gives you peace of mind knowing your safe | Very poor,takes forever to get pictures. If a person rings doorbell can't see person until their gone. The ring stinks. Need much improvement. | Imagine paying a subscription to your door bell 🤣 #latestagecapitialism | Doesnt work on my Pixel Pro 7, cannot change yo App | It provides me with security for my home. Thanks | I can't sign into the app. When I try I automatically brings up a chrome browser to finish login. After I finish with my details it responds with ""sorry unsupported browser try the app"". I really don't understand what I am supposed to do because it just takes me in circles. | love the concept..$3 monthly quickly adds up especially with all the inflation. I find the eufy option to be a better investment and will be switching all my rings out. no monthly fee & longer lasting battery = win win!! | Camera does not capture all videos of people, animals entering my yard. Plenty of people have come to my door but are not captured on video. Dont know how many tines we've reset the camera. | Works well but features hidden behind pay walls even after paying a subscription, picture in picture for example, a basic feature found in many apps for no subscription at all. | I've been trying to login to the app for a while now and it keeps kicking me to a browser only to say that my browser isn't supported. Why is the app redirecting me to a browser in the first place? Frustrating. I went through the steps as outlined on their website about updating and adjusting browser settings. I use Chrome and still it's stating that it's not supported. There's not even an option to go to the app like it directs me to. | Good | Angry I just upgraded to a ring camera and the app doesn't work. Unsupported Browser To continue in the Ring app, tap the More menu and select ""Open in App"". I follow the help center directions and nothing. Going to return the cameras. Very disappointed. | I gave my Ring device too my daughter, where I'm moving,could you please unblock it for setup purposes. Thank you | The devices and apps are fine and work without issue although I've noticed it's made my mother and sister paranoid spies who check the feed constantly despite the fact that they live in no crime safe town USA | Deleted the app after I got rid of the ring doorbell after they got greedy with the subscription fee. Went to a better bell with no subscription fee. | It's really good and we it's really good protection | Works, barely. I wish they would fix the audio controls so that it plays through the phone's default output device at an adjustable volume instead of just blasting out of your speakerphone speaker without volume control. I feel like there used to be some useful camera controls and settings that have since been removed. The app still works, but just not as well or as pleasantly as it used to. Both of these things need to be restored to improve the user experience. | Updates to the cameras have reduced the range of motion detection. If I'm sold something I want the product I buy as that's the contract. Don't reduce something in a bid to force people to upgrade. Highly Illegal. Do not buy!.. And for those who aren't on FB...? | Stopped working. Reinstalled. Still not working or authorising. Absolutely rubbish | Good, easy to use. | Android, Motorola, As of last week, notifications have stopped working - I note a lot of people are saying this since last update. I've followed all the procedures, which restores notifications for a couple of hours at least. And then, back to normal notifications. Of course ring will ask me to drop them a message (which is hard to do) and then they will tell me to do the exact things I have already done | on both android system and IOS the apps are opening browsers to log in and neither have an option to open in app. My 3 cameras are now worthless. | Great product, peace of mind! | Can't even sign in to the app because I get the ""unsupported browser"" error in Chrome and there is no ""open in app"" option. Reinstalling doesn't help. | I love my ring doorbell and stick up camera | Looses connection all the time | Won't open, keeps asking me to clear data. Ugh!!! | Best doorbell I've ever had. | Constant connection issues, hackable by my neighbors who frequently take control over turning my camera lights on and off and to stop recording. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 | It does it's job | Sometimes it stops recording at the most important time when it detects a person | My alarm went off at 4:00am and I immediately tried to see what was going on, the Ring camera stalled. There was s man in my driveway with his car lights on and I could not turn on the Ring lights or use the microphone. By the time the Ring app started working the person had gotten back into his car and was backing out of my driveway. When I went to history it showed the man walked up to one of my large shrubs and sounded like he threw something in it, then he walked over to the neighbors. 😤 | This app is just so easy and reliable to use. Even when your not home, you are with remote talking to whom is at you door. | The app lock out by itself. | This is my. Daily thing, watching my ring. Love it wish I would have had it months ago when my s*** got broken in too and got all of my deceased mother and aunt's belongings just wiped me out. Been heartbroken ever sinow.I just sit and wait for somebody to cross that alive.They'll be looking down the barrel of a double barrel monkey.. | Worst app and support ever. App ""advised"" that I update and as soon as I did, the app stopped working at all and now, I can no longer see my cameras at all on the app! Which is the precise reason I purchased this in the first place! To see my home when I'm away! Phone calls to support do no good and nothing has been fixed or resolved. | Great camera works fine | Sends the most awful static noise when posting a notification.

Fraud was unrelated to Affirm. Affirm wouldn't make an exception to my reasoning to delay payment a few days while my new debit card arrives by mail.

So i went to try and redeme what $2. and some change because im tired of it and it tells me to check email then click on link and then thers nothing there to click on after i open the email. It use to ne a good app | Very easy to use!! | Wish there were more offers in my area. | this is a great app!! you would be foolish not to use this app every day at the pump 🌟 🤩 I've saved well over a couple hundred dollars within a year! nuff said. | Money is missing and has been getting ""issue found"" or ""expired"" as the reason Money isn't credited. My cash out is $0.26, but it shows on another tab that it should be $59.11. | love this app! never any problems receiving money earned! great job on this app!! | This is a great app! Appreciate the savings! | Terrible, very confusing, doesn't do what it says. | I've gotten so much cash back in such a short time! Worth it! | It works! so far so good | Saves $$ | You can't win anything. big scam to get your cards you use. | love upside | Very disappointed with this app!!!! I have used this app 2x and never received the discount off my gas. I have paid full price both times. First time it was suppose to be $.50 off and I paid full price. Today it was suppose to be $.45 off and still paid full price. I feel this is false advertisement and will not be using this app any more period. And the fact you can't talk to anyone is really a problem | all works well | This app is a joke. It never pays so it just collects data. I would give zero stars if I could. Don't use it just a waist of time. So I was told to upload the receipt but when you try that you get network unavailable. I stand by what I said they are just aftere data. Looks like false advertising to me so if any attorneys see this app might be an easy case for you | Trash | _never received my cash back for my gas or for my McDonald's twice I've used it twice I've got nothing back. I think it's a waste on my cell | they charge a 1 dollar fee to cash out if your balance is less than 10 | Works okay for gas but the restaurant offers don't come through. The offers are held in processing till they expire and you receive nothing back. I probably wouldn't have ordered from the restaurant if upside had not had a offer for it. If this continues to be an issue, I will find a different app to use. Update: all the qualifications to receive cash back were met. The offer expired while processing. The issue is with upside not processing offers not the users of the app. | I don't appreciate jumping hoops 😡 $1 Fee , If redeem amount less than $15 !! | Free $$$. Why not? App is quick and easy. Cash out options are awesome! | if your needing a discount on fuel UPSIDE is great | WATCH OUT: most of the positive reviews are BOTS.8 of the first 10 are BOTS. first use is great, but after first use all of my 15-20 cent discounts dropped to one penny, offer great deals at first but won't actually let you use them. update: some of the offers did change from one cent to four. I tried a few over a couple of weeks and all of them just stuck on ""processing"" until they timed out, so i uninstalled the app. pretty sure it's just a data mining front, hence the obvious pay for reviews. | I like the app but you guys need to add more stores to the upside app. | I love the savings, app is easy to use! there's no downside to Upside! | Good app. My only issue is that it seems because I use it so much my cash back percentages have gone down. Most were only 5% now are only 2%. Gas went from 10c back to only 1c. Not worth using anymore. | worked at first but now it keeps giving me error codes | Cash back takes too long to post to the account or never shows up. It is a real hit or miss. | actually great deals! | I love it. lots of cash back | great to save and get back 👍 | There have been eight gas refunds, not paid, despite the fact that I sent them the receipts. The app says processing until they cancel it. I'm not happy about this. I'd rather go with a gas station that deducts the amount at the time of purchase. | I average $25-$30 per month in cash back. As a part time Uber driver I use a good deal more gas than most. I believe the average driver could reasonably expect $10 per month. The cash back earnings can be deposited direct to your bank account or redeemed for digital gift cards. | Enter Code while signup to get $10. It’s best cashback app among others but there are a lot I mean a lot of issues for example it's kinda like pay by card only to get rebate on fuel u can get more options and ""win"" but you have to pay actual money don't get me wrong it's kinda cheap but. Ifykyk but you can do things without paying it just very limited my second problem is that the characters are always glitching I mean always half the time the characters don't even load in when you change them | Enter Code while signup to get $10. Great cashback rebate app as far as the fuel is concerned. It's the unlocks that drive me crazy. ""Congratulations you've just unlocked the ability to unlock a new cosmetic. And just for you, if you don't won't to spend the thousand years it would take for the RNG to give you the right mystery rewards you would need to actually equip it, we're giving you the option of paying real world currency."" It gets a little old. Like I said though, great gameplay. | Upside helps with the high cost of gas. It's nice to have those savings for an evening out or a movie! | super easy way to make some money back on all the gas you buy. | It's so easy that it makes no sense not to do it. I truly have to thank my daughter ❤️. | great app, a lot of purchases go missing. frustrating. | Seems like anymore only about 50% of my purchases are recieving credit. I get the fuel as i have always been and click ive paid only to see a few days later that its expired. And theres no way to then just click on it to upload a receipt, you have to go through this claim form that they never get back to. Really going down hill. You can even see in their response... ""please fill out this ticket"" HOW ABOUT BRING BACK THE DAM RECEIPT OPTION BECAUSE IT WORKED BETTER | Was doing great 5 years until 2 years recently I always went to the same gas station it would automatically prove my receipt I can get bonuses then all the sudden stop proving my receipts after 10 days I would message why did my receipt not get approved and they manually approve it I would not get no bonus and and ever since that happened I've been doing that for 2 years and maybe I think it automatically approved 3 of 4 within the 2 years now using Checkout 51 no issues | cash back is great now a days with everything so expensive | No gas stations in my area all of the sudden. Was using app all the time and it was great. Now there are no gas stations in my area. It's a bummer because it was saving me quite a bit of money. I guess I'll Uninstall. | Easy to find places where earn rewards :) | I get cash back for gas that I need to buy anyway! | Great app. Easy to use and earn cash quickly. Easy to cash out the cash earned to your bank account or card of your choice. Highly recommend this app. Very beneficial and easy to use. Thank you 😊 | love getting the cash back! | Great app! I'm always happy to give 5 stars to an app that actually works the way it advertises. No scams, no hassle, and it's simple to use. It literally PAYS to use this app. It's definitely an Upside to getting a few bucks back when buying your everyday essentials. | this app works 💪 😊😊😊😊 | I rarely rate apps & this is one good app that rewards you with real money! Started using this Jan 27th 2024 & so far I've gotten $68 given to me. I did a test to send $20 to my bank account & it was in there the next day. Not a bad app for some free money! Highly recommend! | Great idea but you better be ready to cash in 5 minutes after you redeem. The app gives you NO TIME to accrue money to add to a card. | love this app saved me 28.56 in 2 weeks so far | Get Upside is great app now i can earn my rewards on gas | always good to earn mon ey back | Got 2 small rebates, then nothing, stopped getting rebates, will uninstall, doesn't work | Cashback is not always granted, especially in restaurants. A lot of effort for a small reward. There are better options. | Best App | it is a really good app I just cashed out with $27 I love the fact you get paid for getting gas ⛽ everyone gotta get gas so why not get paid | Easy to use, saves you money. | App doesn't work at all, filled up 4 times this month in April, and no cash back at all. Still in processing after 10 days, even after printing and sending the photos of proof of purchase. | great so far. some of the offers haven't gone through but most have. I love getting cash back though. | so far on one purchase of gas I got 12.86 cash back! I think upside is awesome, will use on every fill up | with gas prices the way they are, and ill get an amazon gift card every once in a while, its a no brainer. | it's great getting gift cards with my cash back!! | 1st I love how they don't need your full card info for your purchases. makes me feel a Lil more secure not having another company store my info. 2nd the money can then be sent to via digital gift cards.. I do amazon gift cards and upload it to them. I have had zero issues with upside crediting me after purchase. usually takes 2 days or so. I have a 35 gallon tank. 10cents cash back on a gallon adds up. even if the place across the street is 3 or 4 cents cheaper. | not worth it & it does not work | Since Casey's is a chain location I believe we should get discount at all location | Excellent way to get free money 💰 🤑 💸 | Great way to earned cash | great service | Super easy to use, the pennies add up pretty fast. Easy to cash in too | it's a great way to save/earn money. I earned over 60.00 mostly by getting gas(something you have to do anyway) in about 4 months. | It's a wonderful app. | Wish the rebates for gas were more, in a year I have collected $63. | Honestly, I love this app. I use a work truck and company gas card. but all the extra money I earn goes back into my pocket. I earn about 25$ a month and easily cash out and money in hand within 24 hours. | Why not save cash! It's easy | Can't upload receipts Waste of time | 10/10 recommended! you're spending the money anyway. | I had a rough time figuring out the app but now I have fun with it. If you travel or eat out a lot you can save big. | Edit: to clarify further I was at a racetrac gas station last night and it said 8 cents a gallon back and I hit I paid after fueling up then for the same racetrac it showed 13 cents per gallon I will take screen shots of before and after tonight when I fuel up | It's a great way to save money back from buying gas that you already have to buy.. you save | Enter Code while signup to get $10. I’ve used upside for about 3 years. Upside has added alot of things over the years.. however it seems lately there offers have become oddly extremely hard to complete. The town halls are nearly impossible to take down unless your some YouTube pro. They have really been working hard to suck the fun out of the game and money from your pocket! No you don't have to spend money. but! Good luck getting ahead if not! After 9 years, I'm Close to deleting altogether! | Enter Code while signup to get $10. Upside is the best Cashback app, but there are issues. I've tried Gbuddy, & others. Pros: graphics are console-like and great for mobile, controls and movement are fluid, plenty of different game modes, and updates keep the game fresh. Cons: the UI is pretty awful and really busy now, matchmaking can be uneven, not sure why there are comics, way too many guns, operators, skins, and maps they could do with getting rid of lesser used ones, file size is 30gb. | great discounts. great way to get back cash. | cannot easily update email address and referrals do not transfer to new email address. For this I have changed my review to a 1 star cause this is a 1ntrick pony app now. If you cannot update email address and referrals do not transfer why would I ever promote this ? Cashing out and uninstalling. | The app was great for a few months but now I only see 1 cent a gallon cash back even when my wife and other people I know will have 12+ at the same gas station at the same time. They say it's personalized to each user, I guess what they mean by that is they figure out where you go and what you use it for the most and drop those spots to the bare minimum. To me personally it's not worth the time. | It's really nice, only wish there were more places. It does work, and you do get paid | Over the years, I have recommended this app to everyone I know both personally and thru social media. Recently, I have stopped, and I'm not sure I'll recommend it again. The problem is that entries are held in ""processing"" for so long that they expire. That's not good for business, and the fact that you can not contact anyone to dispute these failures is not good for you... the end user. I'd like to see UPSIDE get back like it was, but until then, shop around for other reward apps. | Very easy to use. Can add several different credit or debit cards at one time in your wallet on the app in order to get cash back. It takes a bit to add up depending on how often u get gas but EVERY little bit helps. And its free, so why not! | Good app 👌 | You can save money! | Thought I was going to love this app. I have coworkers who swear by it. But after trying twice. I've received $0 in cash back. Trying to find out why is an absolute hassle. There's no one to talk to but a bot, and that's less than helpful. They both stayed in the proceassing phase until it hit expired. | Horrible never gets your cash back | Fun easy app, helps a bit with the cost of living in the USA today. | Edit 2024: It's stabled out. I use it everytime I fill up at the Caseys near me. I get cash back and it goes to my bank or pay pay. Thank you Upside!! Original review: Used to be a great app. Not anymore. Edit: 2021ish It has it's days recently...more gas stations were added, then subtracted, then, added, then subtracted. I can't figure it out, but sometimes I figure out it's cheaper to use upside so I do when it's convenient.","{""1"":13093,""2"":3757,""3"":8112,""4"":39392,""5"":283928}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Upside Services Inc.","8321212273852535480","support@upside.com","https://www.upside.com","1701 Rhode Island Ave NW

When a match occurs while using the app and I send a message, an error pop-up appears on the ""new match"" screen. I've recreated my account, but nothing has changed. This app has already been a sea of disappointments as it drives away people who are interested in you if you don't pay for Gold, plus there are still advertisements. Honestly, it's becoming unfeasible to continue using. | Not the best by far, distance it states for members is WAY OUT not just a little but highly out, wants money for this, money for that it is just a money pit, it is very poorly put together and I dont think its performance is monitored at all, Tinder you are not worth paying for as you are now..... | nice app I got new friends | Without purchase premium and boost your most probably invisible if your a guy! So you should put a lot of money to get a match! | good👍 | Slow loading | If someone like u then u have to pay money to see her it is too much expensive....it is also a dating scam and a total waste of time | Not worth at all | it's a good app I like when I use this app | show you D See my tool | Fake profiles have been an issue, now the app crashes and refuses to work. | Very nice | Simply terrible. | Was a good dating app in 2020 if you payed for Platinum I had the $50 subscription for 6 months then downgraded to the $20 Gold for 6 months when I swaped back to the Platinum in 2021 it dident work I try every year 2022 2023 2024 im assuming its the AI on the app the reason I got good results in 2020 is the AI recognized I was a good match as my life got worse the AI can pick it up and it wont match you so I been useing snapchat premium instead its $50 for the year | I downloaded the app, and the main page is stuck at ""something went wrong"". Tried restarting everything - nada. Sucks. | Unusable, account often gets shadow banned, payments reverted, support always says ""try again now"" without providing any detail. After a couple of hours payment is reverted again and account back to shadow ban. | Waste of time | I come across the same profiles multiple times. The app isn't as good as it was years ago. just another money hungry app. Just as useless as ever. disappearing messages. | Please can someone advise mevhowvto cancel subscription? | nice app. | Disgusting app ever . Earlier I used get 10k likes and matches daily . I installed tinder again ,and got shadow banned instantly. Now neither I can get matches nor I can delete my tinder account. Such a rubbish app drolling for money . | Message are not delivering!! | They banned my first account thanks too google phone numbers, you can have as many accounts as you want. And yes, I can verify it through your stupid codes 😂 | Is faking notifications to get interaction on your app a crime? I'm not sure but will be looking into it. ""You got a match"" ""you have a message"" open app to nothing. ""Oh, wanna ever get a match? (Besides the fake notifications.) Better purchase any and everything. Honestly so so had from where this app was years ago. (Seriously going to be looking into false advertisement clauses/uses, etc.) | safe and true | bunch of bots | Good | I spent $150 when it told me $8, I'd like a refund | I just created my account a few weeks ago and then I left to do something for a about a few hours but then came back to find that you locked my account because of a problem i don't even know or so and I've been trying to re access my acc but it says that it's still under review from then till now and if you won't open my account then please just delete it coz I'm not interested in this app anymore. | This app is weird. It says someone messaged me, but i can't see the message?🤨 wont be keeping this app long and ive only had it 2 days smh. | Semplicemente NO | I'm not sure yet this is all new to me!! I've not gotten out done anything in 6 months and my so called ex has had a Tinder for 6 months or longer out of state so I figure why shouldn't I have some fun as well? who knows I may just find happiness on here!! | Trouble sending messages and I subscribe. I try sending a message and it gives me an error | NC but it will be free of cost | everything is behind a paywall | This app is rigged big time: regular, normal guys won't find dates here. | least natches in this app, even payment done | Your app is still horrible. Your dating pool with the ladies is either crazy people, overweight people, or scammers. | Terrible. If you want to meet an actual person go out in the world. This app will do nothing but destroy your confidence and make you feel bad about yourself. (Male or female it does not matter.) If you ever ask what's wrong with the world you are currently apart of it if you are reading this. | App is buggy, appeals department needs improvement. | Remember when this app used to be free damn it's gone down hill since | App is infested with bots to the point theyre the only ones who you match with DO NOT DOWNLOAD | eye opening to say the least. didn't realize so many horrible women were out there. anyway, I get likes occasionally without gold (not saying they respond to me or I like them back). just be good looking 👍, the bio doesn't matter much. | love it! | its great to use so simple and secure | After getting a match it still not showing in message box 📦... I feel tender is doing a scam | takes long to match | I downloaded the app for the first time and tried logging in only to be told my account has been banned!! How? Why??? | The worst ever. For which!? Ive been in the app for long time. I tried to message this company but there is nothing they can do to resolve my issue. I tried to log in again but still nothing. I know I follow the rules but why they banned me. For what reason I don't know. So guys if your planning to add this and find your girl think twice they might going to do it also on your account even you've been loyal to the app. They dont even tried to help me | After spending noney on the app I stoped having matches, sometimes notifications of messages and matches appear but when opened there is nothing there, this app will never think about most of its people | rife with scammers | Don't use this app it's waste ur time | They logged me out and I paid the subscription!! In 2024!? | Just a scam. You have to pay for everything and anything to talk to anyone | how are you | I'm almost certain the app doesn't even show my profile in the stack unless I'm paying for gold, which isn't cheap. The only time I get matches is when I pay for them and even that's iffy at best. Otherwise the app is completely dead aside from the occasional like from a very obvious spam account. The app isn't even worth messing with anymore. | nice | Can not sign up, get through account verification, choose things I like to do, but then says oops try again. Tried uninstalling and reloading 13 times. | I want to delete my account on Tinder, don't wanna pause it, and i tried it several times and always says the same message ""FAILED TO DELETE ACCOUNT"" | Has ads yet still charges a subscription fee 🙄. Ridiculous | You always find a way to ruin tinder with your new safety trash stop your app is for trafficking and pedophiles | Online dating doesn't work for most people anymore, period. Don't waste your time or especially your money | Fake notification to get you subscribed to view mesage | so far so good, just started and it's going well | too many bots on here. not a hopeless romantics paradise, that much is certain! | Very bad admins. | good 😊 | Scam app - people like you and the app then asks you to pay only to see either they don't exist anymore or Trans people. Just got a notification about a girl like, paid 159 only to see her vanishing from like section. This is seriously a fraud and Google must take strict action against them. I'm deleting it for good now. | Pls its nice | Ek ldki nhi pata k diya aaplog.. Agar ek ldki pata k denge.. to 5 star dunga | Dont spend money on this app your better off going to a bar and meeting people in person | It is full to the brim with fake profiles and bot accounts | always has glitches & pay too much for simple things | Too frequent pop ups prompting to send a super like that covers half the information of a profile I'm looking at. Extremely annoying. Every few swipes another prompt, that we share a common interest , to send a super like and etc. Extremely annoying and badly designed. Migrating to ""Boo"" which has a better interface and more reasonable prices. | The app is good | Everything is paid don't waste your data 👎🏻 | The worst dating app by far paid for platinum and never even got one match 😕 just a big waste of my time | Very Friendly and Beautiful woman | It's a Spam | Need to pay premium just to message like is this a dating app or what? | nice | nice | probably amazing if your a girl or attractive 😅 | What is the point of downloading a ""free"" app if nothing is free at all your forced to buy 15 pound gold to even chat to anyone at all at that point might as well make the whole app 15 pounds instead of ""for free"" not to mention the countless reviews of people who have been scammed by the auto renew nonsense horrible app full stop!! | bits | Terrible app. | When are you going to remove the foreigners fakes and social media advertising girls | Rife with bugs and dark patterns, and it only gets worse. It works ok if you're ok with being scammed by the app a little. | Mostly fake profiles, they just want you to pay to upgrade... A scam like everything else in this world... | very good experience | After setting up my profile. I go on the app and get good that there was suspicious activity and have to verify my photos by trying to do a series of photo poses and when I do the first one it is not accepted and I have to keep doing it it. When I click on the contact us button because I am not able to complete the photo verification I got told oops I must have typed wrong. | I meet a scam here pretending to be someone else | not satisfied yet, why cant people chat me and why can't I pay with other currencies when I'm outta Nigeria? | super cool | I love it | good nd nice | don't ask for money | If you are a guy you will not have a good experience with this app. Not worth the time at all.","{""1"":1612014,""2"":367166,""3"":672029,""4"":803307,""5"":3557073}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$0.49 - $299.99 per item","7.0","7.0","VARY","Tinder","8070166968320699506","help@gotinder.com","https://tinder.com","Tinder

When writing a draft essay, doing school works. I haven't received any glitch or lags. But I have a suggestion which is more fonts to be added. And folders so I can seperate my works. | Docs is my favorite editing app with user friendly interface. But for the past 3days, app has been misbehaving. Always stopping when I want to save my work. It sucks please fix it. | Keeps closing itself when I try to use the scroller at the side of the screen when using my tablet | This app is good and convenient but While we are typing it stop suddenly Please fix it. I can't even enter | Good but not excellent | Horrible update now. I used this to turn in pdfs for homework and now I can't. | Worst app | this bug has been ongoing for the last few months and has yet to be fixed: as I am typing away, the program will, for no apparent reason, turn words into jibberish and combine them, as if 'autocorrecting' them. Super annoying. Hope this gets fixed because it makes it impossible to use the app. | VERY UNRELIABLE The moment I wrote alot of things needed for my report it didn't save it correctly now I need to write everything all over again from scratch. | Google Docs I must say is a good app in general, but there are some features that are missing. More fonts needs to be added to the app, option for TOC and watermark and many more. I'll come back for a 5star if all of these gets fixed | Just good. | when trying to write my words always jump around or get combined, with weird autocorrect fixing words that don't need to be. really frustrated considering this is the only app that I use for writing, and this issue is not with my phone. have seen other people go into these issues here as well. | Dark morde y And you get a 5 | Easy to use | I love his app. You can use it for so many things. You can add other people to ur doc and can chance font, size n colour of text if you can find the settings as it is slightly complicated... Otherwise, this is a brilliant app!! | Please write proper update notices in the Play Store, not placeholders. You're Google - set an example for other devs. | How many updates does this need? Perhaps it should be renamed, Daily Update. | How do you change the damn font size? | Good | Very good | Perfect | Awesome | Describe my experience???? I wanted to do things. | Yo e | My rating is 4/5 There are still few things left to be added on Google Doc to make it 100% 1. Creating custom paper size for any document instead of using the available size that it comes with 2. Add more cool font 3. Make automatic Table of content | It Lp Il LouphItp OP loopPo | Good | five score | Everything is great, just as it always has been. | Easy and convenient | Excellent | Suvom💗Cecilia | Sure | Amazing app . I love it. Nothing else to say. Bravo | Trey rrdtdfff | There is no crop option for image, and even if I crop outside, it will still insert the original image. Also, there is no option to remove spacing. I am using a tablet. | Improve | The app is good for storing things | Random capitalism and auto fill, frustrating to use on Android phone, which is ridiculous | Nice security | Muy eficiente. | Love docs | Sucks can't add equations, I was about to think this app is much quicker and more reliant in many ways | Good apps | There should be PIN TO TOP option for files which we use and see dialy. They get to top as we open it, but why there is no option for any file to be on top permanently? | BOYCOTT GOOGLE: GOOGLE SUPPORTS AND AIDS GENOCIDE. Absolute garbage. It's amazing to see how Google went from the best company in the world, to the absolute worst in a single decade. Can't wait to watch Android and Google crumble. Proof positive that when a company gets too big, eventually they stop helping society, and start cannabalizing their own. Monopolies/oligopolies are bad for everyone. | Why do I need this | Excellent 👌 | The app is really helpful over all but it would be even better if I could make separate folders in the app itself and not on cloud. Like if I write 2, 3 things separately but they are part of a big project it's really tiring finding things separately and then working on it. | Good | I use this for my phone then it will kick me out of there alot now !! And i even tried updating it kicked out. Tried restarting my phone KICKED OUT. Please fix this so people can use it on their phones. | Keeps Crashing When I'm Tapping In A Tab Space | Great for mobile documents. The UI for (smartphone) mobile devices could benefit from a reorganization. | This app is not showing in the main screen of mobile | Marked and check | It's great but I wish they'd remove the annoying notification on the bottom of the screen when the text is too long. Or just a way to turn it off | Great | Why can't I download a document? I literally have to email it to myself. | It's working slowly | Quit 👎 today but it Isn't | Very useful | Was a great app until last updates - no longer able to easily title the document ... | Great for creating documents. | It won't let me edit any of my documents on mobile for some reason. This is very annoying and inconvenient, considering I have no laptop to edit from. Please fix this. | Nicelydone | This app is good sometime it crash but this app had collaboration features,editing and file sharing.i rate it 5stars | Good help | Horrible | Wonderful writing document collection app. | Worked just fine on one device until the update, now it won't even boot up, I already cleared out the cache and that didn't work. | Please let us choose our own font sizes again. This goes for sheets and slides also. The app versions are already so limited compared to the web versions and this limits them even more. | I don't use my moto G play to search no website 'snor watch movies on ,that will never take place on my phone. | Why in the world would you remove the ability to set a custom font size? I don't want to be stuck with presets, especially not when I have years old documents that constantly use sizes not within those presets. Why make such a major downgrade? | Sometimes it's hard to useit | As | Great as a journal. Get a lot accomplished | Easy to use and to format text, etc. Don't waste your money on Microsoft office suite. | Why can I suddenly not access my docs? | Only app that I can edit word and converting to pdf isn't destroy the arrangement | not sure | Best app | Google made a strong word processor in an era that was the birth of my favorite. Are they still in the development phase or is this a finished product? Because I have no idea what keeps the ashampoo office free version my favorite. The fact is that they still need to balance volume and name recognition with experience and R&D cost. | Have a great time here and a very important person to speak to be sent from my bank account | Good | It helps open documents | One | Good | It has helped with writing stories, making plans and many other things. | Top app for viewing and editing my documents. Easy group sharing option. Great work Google. | Nice apps | It's slow and lagging | I just got it I don't know what it's like but I'll let you know later about the sound okay whether it works or it doesn't work thank you Dorothy Riggs?!?... AMEN?!?...✴️💯 5:48 am Tuesday 4/23/24 | It's really frustrating using Google Docs these days. Even with a strong Internet connection, I still get the error message ""you cannot open document offline"". It's slowing down my productivity. Please fix! | Good app | After the update, I can't access my offline docs, but I managed to access them. Also, I noticed that I can't edit the title of the document by tapping twice on the upper part of the view mode (the name of the docs). Also, if I tap the format button on the top, it won't disappear after I tap on the screen. I just don't know if it's good or bad.. but it's good that I can now add columns, and there's many options for the bullets and numbering style. | Bad app,I dont like asgnmrnt | Personally, i love it. I can write and edit my fics with ease.

The attendants have always been very polite and helpful. They haven't been able to control the weather, yet. l am hopeful they will have that taken care of in the future. 😁 | Best Airline! | No issues while using the app. | very hard. poorly responsive website | delta is awesome. that's it. that's all you need to know. | better than the website | Check in works great, seat selection works great, miles easy to find, flight change & upgrade work! The App doesn't work too well with a slow internet connection. | love delta and the app is super useful | Delta, and other airlines, have successfully made their apps as inhumane as possible. | Not sure why, but this app FAILS at reserving meals. On 2 occasions for Int'l travel in DeltaOne, this app shows ""Oops, an internal server error has occured. Please try again later."" Have contacted Delta Agents for help via their texting service. Have been assured that chosen meals are ""reserved and confirmed"". Didnt happen on JFK-FCO. We'll see if it's different going home. | excellent | app kinda sucks. to do a lot of things it directs you out to the website and you have to log in again. lots of weird quirks like it won't let you pay for bags with miles while you're checking in..... because you need to be checked in to pay with miles 🤦. | does not update wallet | Time saver | Love the Delta app! | nice | Always my favorite way to fly. Seamless service every time. | great | smooth app | useful and easy to navigate | outstanding service 👏 👌 👍 🙌 😀 | moo | I'm having issue using my miles | The app still lacks a lot of functionality compared to the browser. There is nowhere to add a KTN. The boarding passes say they refresh, but seem like they are loaded from a cache, and still load old information despite it being updated >40 min ago. Definitely room for improvement available. | love it | it works almost all the time | totally unnecessary app making it more cumbersome to just get my boarding pass. | Absolutely love the ease of checking in online and changing flights! Thank you Delta! | no bueno | So far, so good! Everything is working out and convenient. | Excellent service | App is slow and buggy. But it works eventually. | Easy to use application | Delta is one of the worst airlines in the world. | Awesome and Seamless | Terrible. Trief to check-in and want to charge me extra $187 for a seat. Now I am on Stanby. | multiple issues with functionality in app and website. Link to digital ID goes to Web form that doesn't work when checking in flight unable to pay for checked bags do better Delta... | If you were born 80 years ago and will input your date of birth, you will scroll the month page 80x12 times! Good luck. | very bad calendar implementation | easy peasy | no issues with app. | I shouldn't need an app to access a mobile friendly boarding pass | delta won't email you a boarding pass and makes you download their trash app. i completed check in on my laptop only to be forced to do it again via the app to access my boarding pass. | best airline out | The Best | Delta is always great. Everything works as it should, easy to navigate, and information is accurate. | Works great! | easy to use, very user friendly. | very solid app | best airline ever | Just give me my boarding pass, no I don't want your app | best airline ever | The sign in process does not work well | I always have a great experience with Delta! | easy to use and it works 99.5% of the time. | Works well | love this | Great service | Great service and happy cabin crew. | we had a snag in our flight due to a passport error. The attendant Tracy L., was AMAZING! She worked feverishly to get us closer to our destination in Canada, so we could drive across the border with the passport we had. SHE WAS AMAZING!!!! | so easy to use!!! | Difficult to just check in. Geared towards collecting email and sending you advertisements | very convenient and organized | rarely works | lots of log-in issues, and if I check-in on a separate computer, the app status doesn't update. | awesome service | Be nice If you could add your TSA pre-check number inside the app. Going round in circles with this piece of junk try to find where to add it. Come on Delta, you can do better than this piece of junk | God I hate these proprietary apps for every airline. Here, take my data, didn't need it anyway. | shouldn't make you have to use the app just to access your mobile boarding pass but here we are | best airline with the best service | Easy check in | tried to change seats but got error. | very useful for traveling with Delta. makes everything easy to manage including seating and checking in | Great company to fly | best flight app | This app constantly breaks. You can't check in, you can't book flights. It's not reliable. | Great service! | never works | Easy to access useful information. I can normally accomplish all air travel issues in the app and avoid the line with the gate agent. Please add info about what food is available on each flight. | It doesn't store the boarding pass locally, so if it loses network connection, you don't have your boarding pass. This is incredibly dumb design. | easy to use. doesn't crash | the website is really glitches. won't check my bag sais I'm checked in but keeps taking me back to check in | love that I can move around in the app with ease | unecessary repetitive data entry | I ❤️ Delta | hard to believe we have to hit the down arrow on the calender around 700 times to get to our birthdays over 100 more to get to our passport expiration date. That's around 800 times for each of us. | buttons to continue or to submit or to state # checked bags Do NOT WORK. | outstanding | added a bag several times however it's not showing I did. when I added before it said I had a receipt too | easy, well designed 👌🏾 app. Great company! | very easy app to use | Just paid for luggage with points thru the app! Love DELTA! | doesn't allow scanning my passport and i cannot enter my dob. i have to to swipe 50x12 months.. before i could select. My wife has iphone and it is smooth. she entered dob easily and the app on iphone allowed her to scan passport. delta app developers, please update your android version to have scan passport capabilities | one of the easiest app to manage my travels | Great flight crew providing A+ customer service. | You guy's Just get it wrong | Easy to use app! Very efficient way to track travel. | takes a while to load | This app is the best because I hate myself and want to find ways to make my life more difficult like not ever being able to log in with the correct info. | go Delta!","{""1"":3773,""2"":1368,""3"":3059,""4"":13472,""5"":126683}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Delta Air Lines, Inc.","Delta+Air+Lines,+Inc.","MobileApp@delta.com","http://www.delta.com/app",,"https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal/privacy-and-security","Delta+Air+Lines,+Inc.","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QhkICgvXHugQCRG67ncdgJLcnAsmTCQ4q6m_RJ-0O2lVoz--DzqJP7OoBkDAvq5D8w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ftkLG9alAGce_vuAuk93-SjoyAwTisb8WzprwwLrhldpAn6K1xMES7177O4EDL9rMkQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lRmOhM9DotP5wgrzdDyikRGcqJ66KvEzUw02aXRNyWYYmoZ24lUt0_xJraR6UWdBBg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ougCVLHUR-23vZ0BVo0VItbVnvna6eK-KvrdzFjnSl5WaNNJ73r8S_1IdmKB03Z_U6g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/v66mfZJzwJ5P_sYGXY4LmDgEa8cWxAMwfA9Jkwe2mZ_saAKyH7MWW6M0sxTmumFpnA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RSi4RZiBzBfpxRpLm9QbfmCtkP9BhK4id_X5juw3qP3unqS-AT20F1sXVR6bjFIUBg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1gpdDT-klhrpdPE1eAUbDDM78_C0-yEtQ5tv-SU1jd2F5A08M-FDXUoK8btj7aMwyw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tiDcwL_SIn6-6E3FXyFQnUqFwcC_-VgX2e2TyIuXkB9dr60Tkj4hygZUlw6a02vREBk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r24VyFbaLYjzN__4e7g2aZNQkqZoEuOd70J6Ze99_MvetRnrdx8eC411JAFlHI9zig"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xTbF8GtzTb1U04oyVJZzZJEtTPvlwdvee8pEL8px6JsDIbFt4zWntuoxlwn8OJ3cBBQ""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Feb 14, 2011",1712689225000,"5.42.2","What’s New 5.42.2:<br>• Copying your Confirmation number is easier than ever - just look for the copy icon.<br>• Expanded support for pre-select menus to partner airlines.<br>• Minor enhancements &amp; bug fixes to keep things running smoothly.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.delta.mobile.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delta.mobile.android&hl=en&gl=US"
