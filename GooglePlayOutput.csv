Delete if you value your privacy. | بصراحة متجر توفير ممتاز. وسرعة في شحن البضاعة والتوصيل. | we love Temu!! | love it | This app is very useful | Love it | fast delivery, great prices. several sellers on Temu selling the same product, so look around to compare prices. | Best buy app that I've seen in a long time. very good quality product | very reliable | the best app | GOOD To Have | Good | Great 7th | Awful, added items to cart and diffrent items were added. Don't trust this app was trying to add things I didn't want. | I have had no problems, my first order was exactly as described and arrived in a timely fashion. To date I am pleased with Temu and the prices seem to be unbeatable, the items did not seem ""chincy"". | It's a scam app, show you fake gifts so you invite your friends to download but never get the gifts.. Scam | Love shopping with this app | Super surprised with what you can buy on here and fantastic prices | Nice | Very good 👍 👏 👌 😀 | good app to do online purchases well done Temu 👏 | Great items | awesome | cannot believe the range of items the quality and the price constantly looking for more items and so many useful items love it | Great products at great prices | Best App for shopping. Amazing prices | obsessed! | brilliant | wish I.knwe you earlier love it will recommended everyone. | I love always just scrolling through it and as it says in the description of itself it is actually soooo reliable and one of the cheapest places I have ever shopped on online and in store combined- although they don't have a shop bit yeah basically one of the best places to shop on if your e feeling a bit skint or generally just want to find an amazing bargain all fron your bed in the morning or evening- I liveth fact you can places an order whenever and usually get within1 day to a fortnight:) | This app not good | Good merchandise, but sizes are very much smaller than expected. You have to order bigger than you normally wear. | Not good | My experience is that why is not allowing customers with capitec bank yo buy | I love the site, but a person should be able to spend what they want, it shouldn't be a minimum. The games are a joke | This app is promising to give free gifts but in the last stage of rewuesting the customer for referring contacts, they are showing the webpage 9s crashed after they collect all details of the customer and other contacts..i feel something wrong or i feel that iam getting cheated😞😞😞😞 | It's definitely redundant, and how is it free when advertising and your putting your credit card digits into the app. Haven't won all eight gifts yet unfortunately, because I haven't entered a credit card | is truly the best store that comes from China everything comes on time good quality great discounts highly recommend | so far gast delivered and great quality | Avoid this app at all costs having read so many negative reviews and negative comments about the temu app I would not ever download it in any circumstances just seems to be one big scam 😕 | Online shopping good | App was fast but showed nothing remotely similar to what you searched for. AliExpress is still my go to app for Chinese purchases | well worth for the money you paid, carefully select then you will not be disappointed | some items are good, but electric items most of them is not working properly | I'm in love with Temu, so far so good 😊😍😍😍😊 | It says that send to people you will get gifts but that doesn't work spam at all😠 | all my items received and good condition thank you | Hello dear sir or madame I agree that temu is a great app however whenever I do reward challenges at £1 it always stops I always send the messages( links ) to others however it will not work Please change it | Absolutely love this app. Wonderful products, service, shipping and discounts. | wraio gia bike accessories | They make small transactions when you add your bank info. They are scammers. And its funny that they post pics of some random plastic thing to get more downloads | lov this app | Most magical site ever it's a one stop shop | Great | Would to know when i get my order | i love this app i bought online and my Christmas shopping was done and my gifts are amazing and its next year i won all sorts of great prizes its awsome | I got sucked in with the fish game but keep losing progress and no even close to my free items. Doesn't seem worth the time I've spent trying. Should've just bought it and saved my time. I'm satisfied with 90% of what I've bought. Return/missing item's are tricky if you order multiple packages and some may not fit or didn't arrive. So I would advise ordering one package and waiting until it arrives and find out what fits before making another order. | brilliant. deliver on time. never been disappointed. | Hello temu I like your app but the currency is not Indian so make please update your app with a currency change mode that Indians can also use your app Ok | Best shopping app | very bad app | Good | Good deals but I am not spending £10 if I only want one thing most of the quality is good but it is false advertisement as on the app the picture looks good but when u buy the item it looks horrendous I recently ordered a dress that was ment to be tight I ordered the smallest size. the length was correct but it was very baggy TURNS OUT U KNOW HAVE TO SPEND 15 NOT 10 POUNDS | It is a great app | Love it. | everything i have ordered has been amazing , but i love good quality on orders and good material on clothes and shoes. | Too much asking for reviews my eyesight is bad so find it hard to rate everything. | Cool everything I bought was legit but I got pinkeye from a pillow | Excellent shop | They took away the wish list which was what I used to track what I wanted until I got paid. | I love Temu! read the reviews and descriptions, and it will not disappoint! | Very good service 👏 | Lots of cool stuff at great prices | Very good quality items | I've been using this app for a year and it's been a very good experience so far. The email updates you when it's shipping, in transit, and whether it's out of stock (you'll be given a credit if it is). Most orders arrive within 10 days. I was given a $5.00 credit because it took longer to arrive. Lots of hard to find items for specific purposes - tactical gear, camping equipment, cooking/kitchen items, etc.. The drones they sell are top notch. I got a free one just for playing a game! | Lot's of pop-ups and notifications, but it's easy to shut down the notifications, but you're still stuck with the pop-ups. It's a good shopping app but watch and compare the prices. | Most products I've seen were as advertised. Bought cheap humidifier worked for 2 hours. You do get what you pay for as normally as most sites. Pretty good app and sales are good | Very good items at decent prices most the time and also useful when needing to purchase something that would take a few days for delivery. And overall very good for daily life stuff if that is your intention | I love Temu | love this app | This app is Great, but does this app really give free gifts when you use for the first time? | Like the price but the only thing I do not like it's the games because it is a b**** to win the free stuff and when I want to use a coupon it is useless because they mark the stuff up to make u think u are saving big money but u are not saving nothing and I have getting coupons on the fishland and i do not even use them i wish u can swap it out for items instead | Good | Love Temu | first purchase...awesome service...very efficient. love the goods. Thankyou | contrary to what people say on Facebook TEMU is very reputable and the products are great.. | Like a pretty good product easy to buy and not that expensive | Bought loads of stuff, bits and bobs and alsorts great prices | Scam! Absolute scam | Temu are very safe to order the things you love. Very trustworthy and delivers on time. You won't be disappointed, I received my package in the prescribed time and are very satisfied. | love this app | Great job | Nice Apps | excellent | Some good bargains | Muy mala | i like it but don't want to download app | It's a bit of a cheat because you are told you have a rebate but you have to spend more . The rebate system should be explained clearly! | Great purchases and easy returns. Highly recommended | 9o | good | Ots so easy and customer service is the best | the best app temu I love it's like I am a millionaire 🙌 | cool shopping! | Excellent | I love temu! Games are ridiculous! Everyone I know ALREADY HAS TEMU so games are not realistic to play... Sadly this makes me not want to shop at temu at all!!! I don't mind inviting people but ya'll make it pretty much impossible to finish because of the sharing. Please change and I will shop again! Until then spending my money elsewhere | I like this app 💓💓💓💓 | 👍 | I have always received good customer service. I have received items that didn't fit and I was reimbursed without any problem. Temu has many items for organizing and I love it! | a lot better than you think, tried several items and good quality. | Absolutely love this place | One of the best apps I've ever used in my life totally changed my life forever the connection I have with China because of this app I was able to learn so much about myself and so many others it really made me feel like a billionaire customer service was amazing and so easy to work with I believe the game's got a little bit more challenging that's probably because of me and how well I was able to do I'm sorry for that I only wish others could experience what I experienced amen God be with us | Awful | was weary buying of this site but everything I've bought is of great quality its the main place I shop now prices are fantastic delivery really good they let you know every stage we're your items are at and let u know time of delivery highly recommended I've bought kitchen items clothes shoes everything you can think of all at a budget I can afford Thank You Temu xxx | Is anyone else experiencing TEMU updating every couple days? It has literally updated 6 times in the past week and half. I'm deleting it | Have ordered online three time delivery is very good | Freaking LOVE the app. Warning! Watch out cause it's addicting to shop | very good | quality items at a fraction of the price elsewhere 😀 | Great everything on TEMU app | Grate app., 😊 prices,good products to share with good friends!!! 😁 | This app costumer service in 👎 | all products I bought were of good quality,really pleased | Temu app is really quite good | I have been satisfied with all my purchases will keep using. | 95% of the time, the orders I make, are good. The jewelry, so so, cheaply made. Temu is a good place to shop, I will continue to do so. | App is very glitchy and the games to win free prizes never pay out | THEY ARE SCAMMING YOU!!! THEY ALWAYS TRACK YOUR LOCATION DON'T INSTALL PLZZZ🙏🙏🙏 | Great for online shopping, free shipping,lots of rewards, easy chances to win free gifts, awesome policy on late delivery, returns and refunds. | I love this online store they are the best! | Good quality goods good delivery | Always been more than satisfied with all my purchases from you | Love Temu. | addicted to Temu, great items | I love everything I have received. Their customer service department is very friendly as well | I was happy with the stuff I received although it took very long but still just in the timeframe they gave | very good | Where is my gift price? | It's cool for little things that make every day life easier as in price, so with products range. | Annoying!!! | Tried to delete my account multiple times by sending verification code to registered email. I even updated the app, checked junk email, and ensured my email id was correct, to no avail. | 1st time use this app, like many of their items, and 1st time order when I received all sizes are wrong, this is very unpleasant and very disappointed. How can I keep on trust my your app ? :( | Thay advertise that you can get a free speaker just by downloading this app but it's not true | The best app | good products are here , come and get buddies.........❤️‍🔥 | great | good choice | Brilliant prices and very swift delivery. | Excellent | Good | Amazing app 👏🏻 👌🏻 | Filters don't work | Most of the products are well made and great pricing! Sometimes sizing is a little off. I've bought jewelry, shirts, dresses, shoes, and handbags. When I find something I like, I usually reorder in another color. I like getting free shipping too. Usually items arrive in a timely manner, but not always. | Clone site-coukd not control/delete account-prices locked, filters locked-hacked | I got paid to say this and they've held my family hostage but ith i think its ""amazing absolutely fantastic, it change my shopping life I love temu"" please help us we've haven't eaten in five weeks | Amazing app | temu is great online shopping app | Great company | great prices love shopping here | Bad | loving the new online shopping experience | great full lace better than tiktok shop 💯💯💯💯💯💯Temu wins hands down 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 | just joined so far good | love it | Beutiful | Good quality, the clothing is great it doesn't look cheap or feel cheep, sizes are accurate. Good delivery times. other products are similar. love it because the clothing is slightly different so you don't just English styles. my wife loves the look and feel of the clothing. | It's been OK, cam be annoying. Not bsd. | I absolutely love Temu and there very helpful pleased love shopping with them my orders and items i bought are brilliant it so easy for returned any clothes i have bought from Temu have washed brilliant just love shopping with them☺️😍 | I don't know I have not tried it yet,but a friend of mine,send Justin to me that I should download itKarma and said I would like it | I love everything that I got from Temu | If you ever wanted something guaranteed to be made by a child in a sweatshop from asia then it doesnt get better then this | I love how everything is low priced 😍 | Nice coins | We look forward to every package. The kiddos do too! | Got a few things so far and they are nice and got the stuff in the time frame it gave me | WOULD LIKE TO SEE CLOTHES & SHOE SIZES IN USA TRUE SIZES. WOULD PREVENT ALOT OF RETURNS AND EXTRA WORK FOR YOURSELVES. | it's a nice app, great for both novelty and got to have items | Steals data | Fun games and great prices | easy to use and shop with. | Scammers app 100% TEHY STILL YOUR DATAS AND SELL THEM TO SCAMMERS. THEY CHARGE ILLEGALY AND VERY DANGEROUS FOR BANKING WITH THEM. DO NOT TRUSTVTO THIS. | love love love temu | Annoying Notifications, they are so frequent, pointless and phoney it's insane . All their men's shirts are that slippery polyester material. Not any shirts that are cotton. I learned the hard way ordering and having to send back. | Amazing 😍🤩 | I love 95% of everything I've ordered... which has been ALOT to date. the USPS delivery is slow, but a good trade off to the list prices. anything late or damaged has been credited immediately, no complaints. | perfect for online purchase | Nice | Good products | Temu on Point😍 | It lies to you because on the ads it says that the shipping and item was free and when you play a whole athor game the only ad that pops up is your ad and when you click on a item it gives you 2 ads it is very annoying😡 | Who. Knows. We. Will. Just. Have. To. Find. Out. For. Myself Look | I tried to refund my stuff but they only give me a coupon and I don't want a coupon I want my money back | Looking at this is a great pastime. | pay attention and read descriptions great for the price | I am very pleased with my purchases. Thank you! | Not a bad buying app but the prize part off it is a scam can't win what so ever | . ...","{""1"":132239,""2"":24380,""3"":35887,""4"":192702,""5"":2425949}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Temu","6891936352065498609","androidhelp@temu.com","https://www.temu.com/","Suite 355, 31 St. James Avenue

You shop more, and the prices on the app get higher for you because they think they got you!

Needs work."",""This Is a total scam. I don't know how is it possible that they are allowing this here. 1. It ads for an item with x price and when you go to buy it, it jumps like 2x the original. 2. The reviews on the app are controlled by the app. They allow only best reviews on. 3. There are some games on the app which is impossible to complete. 4. It says for an item that it has 90% off, but when you go there and see from the original price, not even it doesn't have any change but it's increased."",""Temu is a mostly good and intuitive app. Prices and items are surprisingly good. It's been great with the many orders that I've placed and the shipping has always been within the estimates for arrival! Amazing! However, Temu got rid of the wishlist. Other shopping apps (Amazon, eBay, etc.) give you the option to save items to a list. In addition, it comes across as being gimmicky with constant annoying promotions and rigged fake spins, so I had to turn off all notifications.""]",false,false,false,"com.einnovation.temu","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.einnovation.temu&hl=en&gl=CZ"

I added so many items to buy, and when im trying to place the order, i waste so much time looking for them again. | Could not place order. At the last step for payment it did not accept my order because it asked for the postal code. I had ordered in store delivery and the part of the form where I added my adress, there was no field asking for the postal code of my home address.

The app has a bug related to zip codes that makes the delivery address unavailable. | Works as intended. | Simple and fast | English language is necessary | Very nice, easy and fast delivery home. | Ok | Ok | Good app, in the store it barely works because of the internet issues at the location. (Galati store) | ❤❤❤ | Foarte multumita | 👍 very good | Best shop! | Prosta, ale działa bez zarzutów. Nie ma zbierania punktów co jest trochę na minus. | I have just placed my first order. The app works great and it.s easy to use. | The best clothes quality ever . I always buy things here | Super | It would be great if the store pickup would actually be available in stores for all the orders. I encountered this problem on today's order, and was advised by call center that during busy times with discounts, the stores may block for a while this service. This is inconvenient for clients, since it becomes a service we can't actualy use, when needed. I think it would be ok to find this information in the app. Other than this the app worked fine. | De ce nu apar și magazinele din București? | I tried to order, when I want to pat- I get ""server error"" message . | Excelent | EasyJet to use | O asteptam ca si cand...perfect | Fain! | The app works really great. But kindly make the app more user friendly. Unlike most apps that have English Language options, this does not have. And it makes it pretty useless for non-polish speaking persons like me to interact with the app. The rating now is excellent with the help of a nice polish lady otherwise, it would be the reverse. Make it more internatonally user friendly for non polish speak people in Poland. Thanks | Super | !! Nu recomand. 2 saptamani o comanda,Groaznic! Si dupa ce pleaca comanda din depozit mai dureaza intre 3-5 zile Lucratoare! Genial! | Nice app! | Can't order in the app!!! Tried to add the address 100 times and everytime it said that the address is wrong!!! Used the same address on the website and it worked instantly. Fix it asap otherwise there's no point in having an app for and online shop if you can't order! | Aplikacja działa fatalnie. Kilka funkcji w ogóle nie działa lub generuje błąd. Na przykład, teraz mam problem z zamówieniem, więc naciskam ""chat"" i nic się nie dzieje, naciskam Zadzwoń i aplikacja wyrzuca błąd. Przy składaniu zamówienia również były problemy... | Works great so far. Very happy that finally there is an app for one of my favorites stores. Easy to use. It took me a while thou, to see how to delete an item from the Shopping Cart, but found it in the end 🙃 Good work, guys! 👍🏻 | Quick and easy to order | A good experience | Easy and good | Really nice! | Easy to use | Super 👌 | Unfortunately need to change my review: app is unstable and not ready for mass prod usage. Crashing often during selection of delivery services, final payment is not registered by system and as result: a lot of time is wasted. Please perform proper testing and prepare app for client usage. Will update review after bug fix | Everything perfect | No option for other languages, I know that it's for Poland but it'd be great if you lot add English as well atleast. | To use app i need to read and accept regulations. There is no button to accept this. You need to fix this bug. Edit: Everything works fine now. | Git | W czasie przeglądania produktów przestaje wyświetlać zdjecia, po chwili zamyka się bez ostrzeżenia. Po ponownym uruchomieniu wymaga ponownego logowania. Z powodu błędów w zasadzie uniemożliwia zakup czegokolwoek. | The app has got a bug, which blocks the order. Once chosing delivery method as pick up point based on geolocation the consumer can't change the pick up point even there is manual option. It took me 1 hour to place order. I recommend to better test the app before deployments to production :) | Interesting | Application keeps crushing all the time. | Cant switch the language | Multi language is missing | Not a UK version it doesn't even go past the first page. Just has something written in a different language | Draznia mnie podpowiedzi co robic, to powinno byc tak latwe wcobsludze zeby podpowiedzi nie byly potrzebne. Teudne do odnalezienia: koszyk. Problemy z platnoscia BLIK. | Doesn't work at all. Server error | Intuicyjna i przyjemna aplikacja | Doesn't work . Can't log in at all. It says wystąpił nieznany błąd | This app system Very bad | Why it's in polish? Does the app work in other countries beside the Poland? For example Lithuania? | Is this only for users in Poland? | Od tygodnia, chcąc wejść w historię zamówień, jedyne co się w niej pokazuje to""wystąpił nieznany błąd""... Odinstalowanie aplikacji i zainstalowanie jej na nowo problemu nie rozwiązało. | Tragedia! Nie jestem w stanie złożyć zamówienia. Cały czas wyskakuje błąd, wyrzuca mnie z koszyka. Na stronie internetowej jest tak samo. 😐 | Płatności przez PayU wymagają zatwierdzenia na stronie banku, a nie ma informacji na ten temat na stronie sklepu,żeby przejść na stronę banku. Przez to 3 razy zamówiłam jeden produkt. | App is not working nor the website is working for the online purchase. Disgusting | Nie da się dosłownie nic załatwić.

My issue was, if you went into settings and clicked ""rain radar"", it always defaulted to the UK, as the second picture in the description, but the developer has said they will look into the issus, so overal a very solid app. | Awesome weather app | accurate and up to date | Brilliant thanks | brilliant | Installed a couple hours ago. Just checked to see what it says. Said partly cloudy. Hardly. It's storming. Thunder, lightning, pouring rain. Huge fail. Good thing there is not a tornado! | Only updates every hour. | It's very good and I see it everyday and it's mostly correct. Thank you. It's my best app. | excellent | Motorola forced my phone to download this unwanted app. | Spot on the weather | Leam More | very good app | It is not possible to turn off ads for a fee. Doesn't support themed icons. Not possible to sort locations, left menu opens instead. | Clear information easy to understand at a glance. | Aung Thu ya | Very good | Excellente | 👌 | At my location the app on my home screen says 6 degrees but when I tap the app it says 10 degrees. | Accurate weather forecast | Great | Usually spot on | Very poor | The best by far👌 | keeps you in form when a storm is coming in | Good app | This gives you a better forecast then our local weather. | Nice smooth app with good forecasts but the hourly part 48 hours etc not to clear,hence 4* | no way to get rid of ads, goodbye | just downloaded this but i like it. | Wondering and Incredibly!!! | I like the app because it has a lot's of features | really good indication of the expected weather conditions | more details then the met office | 5 star when the winds speed is displayed on the radar screen. My favourite bit of an app, great for deciding if an hours bike ride is possible giving minute by minute rain info, and the wind speed is important because I'm in my seventies and being blown off a bike hurts. Wind speed still NOT clear. Where is it? Want a little arrow with mph and then I'll give five stars. Also the ""forecast"" part of the radar map moves much too quickly. | It's okay 👍 | seems to be accurate, and reliable👍👍👍👍👍😃 | this app is very precise I love it | doesn't matter how accurate this is if it has unskippable ads when you wanna check the weather | This application is very excellent and better, yours should use the services of weather and temperature of the region from this application | Great app! | excellent app | Brilliant | But can you get rid of ads Please 🇨🇦⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍 | Very good at getting an idea of what it could be like. | I've been using this app for a long time and am fully satisfied. It is extremely accurate with it's predictions, even showing the exact progression of cloud movements and amount of rain each hour. Highly recommended! | very detailed info. thx | It is stuck in an endless cycle asking to subscribe and pay and accept all cookies. Not good at all | Great | very few ads in a great radar | Worthles it's raining crazy and it shows 0 percipitatiom | adverts annoying but app good | It takes a degree in rocket science to figure it out! | Love the radar - so helpful for planning my dog walks etc | Way off on weather it said nothing about snow for today or the the next 16 days yet theres almost 3 inch ad it says it be raining in the next i highly doubt with how hard its snow which isnt light liks its claiming. | Well for one thing it's gonna rain tomorrow- and for my location it said it would be cloudy for 2-14-24 and I work outside I need an app that highly accurate, yours is not . Sorry that's the truth.🙁 | a good weather app and radar | good | Awful | Great updates. | Excellent and accurate predictions. | All the lastest weather from multiple cities I frequent. All in the palm of your hand 😊 | Great app, very accurate. | usually accurate | After 3 Days of your Weather App showing that it was Raining at our location when there was No Rain Falling or anywhere on the Radar, I have uninstalled the App and have Gone to another more Accurate Weather App. | i give it 5 star because it had what I was looking for but we still have more to came | I have had this app for nearly a year. I find it the most accurate to date from any other I have used.🙂 | Good clear weather forecast | Use it every day and its accurate | Just what I need a true upto the min update | best weather app around | First class A GREAT SITE WEATHER IS ALWAYS FIRST CLASS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. WORTH A LOT MORE STARS. THANK YOU AWAYS USE IT FOR MY WORK. STILL THE BEST WEATHER APP YOU CAN GET A BIG THANKS | Thank | great weather app. may be the best one yet. | Jutt | Love the radar view and the whole app in general. Highly recommend. | is very interesting it's make you to get lots of things | Use it everyday. Radar is a great feature. | Truthful | Uses wrong location for weather. When using location it keeps picking someplace other than my city, yet if I go to the satelight image, it shows my accurate location. | Good | Awesome App | Not accurate. Decent usability and function, but not accurate most days after 4 weeks of use. Terrible. | This is the best weather app I've found.....and it's free. | I like it | I tried to find Porto (Portugal) but it shows random places started with 'Porto' in just a few countries, no Portugal. Not to say how counter-intuitive it is where a country is mentioned in search results. And how the search field just disappears when you tap to correct your request. This UI sucks. Deleted the app after 10 mins. | Good bit sometimes a bit slow die to ads | It's got everything I want. Just wish there was a way to pay for getting rid of adds... | so I'm enjoying the weather app | Awesome.... I rarely like any app, lol ! This one I do.... Have a look please! | super | The best weather app I ever had. | I find the detail very easy to understand | Why isn't WICHITA'S NAME USED? | a great app for weather, clear and easy to use | brilliant app and keeps you updated daily | weather an the MONEY ❤️ | Easy to use and quite accurate too, makes such a difference 😆 | fantastic | Always seems to be the most accurate app for my location in Germany. Always used the Google weather app in the past, but that became wildly inaccurate at my location. I still have it installed and it seems to have improved again, but nowhere near as good as weather24. | Easy to use. | Very good. Accurate in my location despite it being very isolated. Radar function works great for my outdoor work. | App display is large and easy to understand. | love it. quite useful | Great app 👌 | Great colour editable widget and so far weather data been precise. Would like to see wind details in the widget in future update. | it's telling me weather before it happens. | Love you | brilliant ,and more or less correct all the time | Does what I want it to do! | just wish I could put it on my desk top for easiness otherwise ok. | Good idea, just not accurate at all. Between 3°-5° warmer than many other apps. | Confusing interface. There's a storm outside with 40mph winds and yet this app does not show any warnings, windspeed or any other relevant information | Excellent for any part of England or any part of the world. 99%accurate ,especially with the radar part of the app. | make it easier to get more days | accurate whether! | fairly accurate | I've just downloaded the application. I'm busy checking the accuracy of the physical quantities, particularly the temperature. The application already looks pretty amazing. | Previsioni del cavolo. Non ci prende manco di striscio | Best I have used so far | Perfect app for checking for rain! | Joke. That's all I can say . This app says 32 degrees you go outside look on the thermometer and it's 12. | Very good app to have on your phone check the weather at any given time and to see if its OK for you to go out without getting wet. | Pretty good and add locations to view an area that you may be travelling to in the near future. | tells you everything and many updates | LOVE THIS WEATHER APP! | Absolute garbage. Said snow at certain times, changed and changed....nothing...clear skies. Least accurate app for UK I've used. | radar is quite accurate | Good display | 👍👍👍👍 | Hate afs in my stuff | I really like the app but to get five stars, you need to have feels like temperature in the current section and in the hourly section. I see feels like on the daily outlook but it's equally if not more important to have on the current and hourly forecasts. | Excellent weather app. Used to use the Weather Channel but constant issues after an update led me to delete it. This app has no glitches, yet, and does everything that I need from a weather app. | Quite reliable? | Works perfectly | BRILLIANT FORECASTS!!!! | Very well deisgned widgets | does what it's supposed to do. | Money make money I choose don't come around conjure story best of Lucky | love it ! | seems to be very accurate | Works great. | really accurate forecasts | Have good day sunshine | Weather 8n Shreveport LA 71109 | Ok | accurate app | Seems to be accurate | feel good 👍 | very reliable | 👍👍👍👍 | detailed map and easy to follow | works well and accurate | easy to understand & currently less adds than others! | The app works great, however, the weather forecast doesn't follow the exact time zone of the city I chose, only local time is shown. | love | Great app. Accurate, understandable forecasts | Even with location enabled Radar just sits there turning endlessly and doesn't show anything. I have literally waited several minutes whilst the progress arrow circles endlessly. What more do you want to know? | the layout is easy to read and the info is colorful there are settings that can be set for other locations I really like it | amazing app | Simple, clear, accurate. What's not to like. | awesome job 👍 | Good as gold | 💜💜💜💜💜 | very good | So far... Seems like one of the better weather apps I've seen. | one of the best forcasting weather apps | The most accurate weather app I've had. I use it for dog walking, it tells me if it's showers or heavy rain, how strong the wind will be and what time it will start and finish.

Got some items and returned, their policy says easy returned but aramex never comes to collect the goods, I had to take it to aramex but still after a month I have not received any confirmation of receipt. I contact customer care, and the application keeps on showing an error when trying to share the collection request. Please fix that issue."",""I used it once from Saudi, here is my feedback: Variety wise: the app is so good as it combines alot of different brands that can definitely do shopping easily and avoid those brands under boycotting. User Experience wise: it's also friendly Logistics and delivery: I believe this is the pain point, I guess the reason is because all orders are dispatched from Turkey.

Poprawcie to. | Aplikacja sam w sobie działa dobrze, ale brak kanałów powiadomień jest dość irytujący. Dobrym usprawnieniem byłoby wydzielenie kanałów powiadomień w ustawieniach systemowych. Jest to bardziej intuicyjne niż ustawienia konta | kolejni oszuści | Mało jest tak dobrze zrobionych aplikacji zakupowych. Jestem w Allegro od prawie dwudziestu lat i cieszę się, widząc, jak prężnie się rozwija | Good | Good | Dlaczego cały czas nie można wyszukać wielu produktów na raz. Opcja jest banalna i dostępna w wersji przegladarkowej na PC dlaczego w apce tego nie ma??? | Brak monochromatycznej wersji ikony aplikacji Edit: mam na myśli to, że od Androida 13 i wprowadzenia ""Material you"", ikony aplikacji mogą mieć wersje monochromatyczne, dostosowane do wyglądu i kolorów systemu użytkownika. Aby ta opcja działała, developer musi udostępnić monochromatyczną wersję ikony. Android 15 za rogiem, a aplikacja Allegro dalej tego nie wspiera. | No language options. The app installs in the standard app store country language (I live in a country CZ but don't speak local language) and if you try to change only the language this is not possible. | śmiga, szkoda że nie ma czegoś w stylu szukania kilku przedmiotów naraz z jednego sklepu | Tak jsem objednal nejake zbozi co ceske obchody nemaji.

Dekuji ale uz nechci. | very good service | Nie mogę nic kupić, apka wysypuje się i zamyka przy przejściu do potwierdzenia zamówienia. | Ostatnio służy mi tylko do sprawdzania przesyłek. Wyszukiwarka jest nieprzydatna, np. przed chwilą żeby przewinąć przez wszystkie promowane, wyróżnione, sponsorowane oferty musiałam przewinąć ekran STO DWADZIEŚCIA RAZY. Do tego wyszukiwarka zapomina sposób sortowania ofert. Wciąż brak też opcji filtrowania przesyłek z wysyłką z Polski. I nie, filtr przesyłki najpóźniej do pojutrza to nie jest to samo. Na przesyłkę z Polski mogę chcieć poczekać nawet tydzień i nie zamierzam takich ofert odrzucać. | Most items are shipped only locally, other, which can be shipped, cost a fortune to do so | Brak kodu odbioru pomimo statusu Odbierz przesyłkę, brak maila czy sms'a. Brak możliwości zgłoszenia problemu z odbiorem. Nie zamierzam więcej korzystać z One Box. Do tego męczące notyfikacje. | Nie da się zmienić języka, przynajmniej bez logowania, a mając telefon po angielsku nie wyszukuje ofert po polsku... Dramat. Odpowiedź autora: zalogować się, kolejny dramat logiki. Nie będę się logował na czyimś urządzeniu tylko dlatego, żeby przejrzeć oferty. Słyszeliście kiedyś o czymś takim jak bezpieczeństwo? Albo prywatność? Efekt jest taki, że trzeba używać zwykłej przeglądarki WWW, bo apka nie ogarnia z lenistwa autora... | ВНИМАНИЕ!!! Не советую пользоваться данным сайтом и приложением. На платформе существует возможность регистрации продавцов с несуществующим почтовым адресом с ПЯТЬЮ НУЛЯМИ (00000)!!! Такому продавцу нет возможности отправить товар назад, что нарушает закон. Больше 2 недель уже переписываюсь с так называемой ""поддержкой"", которая не способна решить проблему. Вынесено решение что ""Возврат средств через Allegro Protect невозможен."" Цены на многие товары выше чем на Amazon и/или AliExpress. | I went into Allegro website and I posted order as per their instructions. I transferred money to their K-pay acc but they asked for more and more money and I stopped. But they did not refund my deposited money. This is a cheating website. Watch out all. | I went into the Allegro website and I deposited the money as their instructions. However at the third step they asked for a lot of money that is over 620$. I lost just over 425$ and I cannot get my money back. This website is a cheating online platform. Please be careful. | Allegro jest najgorsze, allegro pay to uszustwo unikajcie, kiedyś bylo 6 rat free, teraz prso 5000procent za dwie.. Ceny tak samo, dzisiaj na Amazon kupowałem BO MUSIAŁEM. Allegro była 70 zł różnica... Czyli 160 na allegro 90 Amazon... OD WIELU SPRZEDAJĄCYCH. Ostatnio otworzyłem dyskusje allegro, to dali mi babkę co przeczytać kilku linijek tekstu ze zrozumieniem nie potrafi...... | Nie ma chyba zadnej innej aplikacji na swiecie, ktora ma tak ogromna ilosc irytujacych, bezsensownych powiadonien, ktorych nie da sie wylaczyc. Nie chce wylaczyc wszystkich powiadomien push, poniewaz niektore sa istotne, ale idac ta droga musze dostawac duza ilosc innych powiadomien, ktore sa zwyklym marnowaniem mojego czasu i uwagi. | Aplikacja działa w porządku, dobrze zoptymalizowana, lecz funkcja sortuj/filtruj jest praktycznie nie istniejąca. Każde wyszukiwanie jest pełne promowanymi/sponsorowanymi ofertami - wyszukiwanie jest bezużyteczne. Czasem ""przescrolluję"" do zwykłych ofert, ale jeśli podgrupa ma tysiące produktów, jest to awykonalne. Jeśli Allegro chce utrzymać swój model monetyzacji z promowania ofert, to w jakimś stopniu powinna dać opcję do odfiltrowania sponsoringu. Nie da się przeglądać ofert na Allegro. | I was told to use app to get a one-time discount. In the app itself, I was told that first I need to pay more to get that discount. | Too often things arrive late, damaged, or not as described, its difficult to pick what to buy as a lot of junk and fake items is also being sold, the quality of goods on Allegro can never compare to what Amazon has to offer.Its a cheap Czech wannabe Amazon as everything in this country its lame | Brak ""Allegro lokalnie"", gdy zmieniam język z polskiego na np angielski. EDIT: Odnośnie państwa odpowiedzi, nie rozumiem dlaczego wybór języka w aplikacji ma cokolwiek wspólnego z wyłączeniem sprzedaży lokalnej. Przecież można sprzedawać lokalnie w innym języku, niż Polski. | Gdy klikam w wyświetlany produkt, który mnie interesuje, przekierowuje mnie do innych promowanych droższych produktów, o innych parametrach. Mało przejrzyste przeglądanie w porównaniu z podobnymi platformami w innych krajach. | Próbowałem negatywnie ocenić sprzedającego, to allegro najpierw rzucało błędami, a potem uwaga uwaga ukryło opcje oceny tego sprzedawcy i tego produktu, gdzie przy wszystkich innych produktach dalej one wiszą. Jest to karygodna nieuczciwość, życzę wam wszystkiego najgorszego | Przy zmianie miejsca dostawy i wybraniu z mapy punktu odbioru, aplikacja zawiesza się. Nie można sfinalizować zakupy, a po wyłączeniu aplikacji zakupy trzeba zacząć od początku. Odinstalowanie aplikacji i jej ponowna instalacja nie rozwiązuje problemu. | I am purchase JBL 200 hedphone It's not good, Only left side working, The seller must know everything,,They knowingly give bad products to customers, now they want me to return it at the expense of my own money. | The application worked well before last update. Now it is awful. Everything is freezing, and I can't choose felivery method and pay for the product. Please, fix it. | Email on shopping titled with cheapest thing. Should be the most expensive | Podwyższając cały czas prowizje dla sprzedawców i cenniki dostaw odrzucacie swoich klientów. Na tym etapie nie opłaca mi się już zamawiać na Allegro. Mam Amazon Prime, gdzie mam darmową dostawę na większość rzeczy + filmy i seriale. A co mam w Allegro Smart? Darmową dostawę tylko na zamówienia, od jednego sprzedawcy > 50zł. Skończyły się czasy monopolu na polskim rynku. Macie teraz konkurencję, która ma lepszą ofertę niż wy. | Obecnie największą bolączką aplikacji jest brak podtrzymywania ""sesji"" przeglądania. Obecnie macie czasami po setki tysięcy przedmiotów w jednej kategorii. Zdarza mi się nagminnie zadawanie po kilkanaście filtrów żeby przeglądać to co mnie interesuje, niestety wtedy w trakcie przyglądania wystarczy przypadkiem cofnąć jeden raz za dużo, i cała przeglądana lista wraz z ustawionymi filtrami przepada na zawsze. Odechciewa się wtedu w ogóle używać wersji z Androida. Takie zakupy zostawiam na pc. | very good | Good app but not given cancellation option... it's to big problems | I pay for smart membership and I'm based in Czech Republic. The app is available only in Czech or Polish, no way to change the language. Because I cannot change the app language to English, I'm only buying from Google searches, never from the app itself due to the language barrier. | Dostaję zdecydowanie za dużo bzdurnych powiadomień. Używam aplikacji do śledzenia zakupów, ale regularnie co kilka godzin mam powiadomienie o promocjach, ofertach ktore zupelnie przypadkiem przeglądałem, albo coś zupełnie bzdurnego. Dziś pobiliscie rekord zawracania gitary: ""niedziela handlowa: na allegro kupisz w niedzielę."" - no dzięki za info, totalnie potrzebne mi bylo żeby zakłócić spokój w niedzielne popołudnie i wezwać mnie do telefonu. Edit; na odpowiedź: nie da sie wylaczyc dlatego 1* | Nie mogę zmienić sposobu dostawy, aplikacja się zawiesza. Edit: mam ponad 10gb wolnego miejsca, tylko aplikacja allegro otwarta, internet raczej stabilny. Tylko przy tej jednej czynności się wiesza | Good app | Application is confusing. It is hard to find specific products. I wanted to evaluate my previous purchase, but there was a problem with the expired token. | To jakaś masakra od miesiąca nie idze dokończyć zakupów w aplikacji. Jak chce zapłacić BLIK to po powrocie do aplikacji z kodem wisi jak trup.... Masakra. | good | Powiedzcie proszę UI-jowcam że ta ostatnia zmiana ze zwijano-rozwijanym headerem jest do dupy. Dlatego że kontent który ciągnę do gory musi zostawać pod palcem. Niech ten header zwija się, ale kontent musi zostać pod palcem. Zerknijcie jak to jest zrobione z address line'em w mobilnym chromie. Upd: sory, nie podałem wersji klienta - Android 8.53.1 | Kiedys byla dobra.. a od konca 2023 coraz gorzej.. appka nie dla klkenta a dla sprzedawcy głównie droppshipingowego... wciskać jak najwiecej bylejakich produktow. 2 a nie 1 bo jednak cos tam mozna znalezc w gąszczu śmieci.. brak filtrowania na ""niechińskie produkty"" | Ogolnie lubie te aplikacje ale zgodzę sie z innymi opiniami ze przydalo by sie dodac kilka opcji jak chocby te WYSZUKIWANIE KILKU czy przeglad alternatywnych WARIANTÓW w formie listy, opisu etc. Aktualnie trzeba kaze kliknac i nie wiadomo jaki to wariant. Dodatkowo od pewnego czasu podczas wyboru innego paczkomatu czy sposobu dostawy (po wskazaniu paczkomatu i kliknieciu ""wybierz"") aplikacja sie kazdorazowo zawiesza. Dziala ta opcja tylko na wersji z przegladarki. Aktualizacje nie pomagają. | Kvůli mojí recenzi na falešný produkt na Heurece mi volali 3x a jednou napsali mail abych jim vysvětlil proč je falešný, i když na jejich webu to psalo přes 20 poláků.. Následně už ani neodpověděli. Nedoporučuji předávat kontaktní informace. | Działa źle, jak stolec (cenzura google) przy wyborze allegroboxa lub innego punktu (czytaj zmiany adresu punktu) aplikacja się zawiesza więc nic się nie da kupić . Reinstalacja , wyczyszczenie danych apki nic nie daje . | Good | Ciągle występujące lagi utrudniają korzystanie z aplikacji. Po wyjściu z aplikacji allegro, aby skopiować numer blik nie mogę go wpisać w rubrykę. Po tym jak opuścimy aplikację należy ją włączyć od początku, aby z niej można było normalne korzystać, co niestety uniemożliwia mi dokonanie płatności. Bardzo proszę to naprawić. | Brak możliwości filtrowania produktów wg kraju wysyłki, a jest to często kluczowe w kontekście cła, kosztów i czasu dostawy. | Aplikacja myśli, że jestem botem i blokuje mi możliwość logowania, nie pokazuje też moich zakupów. Wyświetla się tylko: ""Ups! Nie udalo sie wyswietlic moje zakupy"" | saldo bieżące dobrze. A gdzie numer do wpłat... Dziękuje za radę. Opinii nie zmieniam. | Recently I've had a really bad experience with Allegro as one of the products I bought turned out to be unoriginal and of very poor quality. Customer Service Representatives very extremely unwilling to resend an email with a link to change the product opinion. P.S. Developer of the app responded to me that 90-day is the time frame to post and/or edit the product opinion as per Allegro rules. Unfortunately that is a lie as I just changed the product opinion today reaching out for help to google | Good app and fast delivery, but I can only view the app in Czech. Can't copy/paste to use translate tools. Once installed, can't view items on Web (with built in translators) due to automatic app redirect to the app. Would give 5 stars if had an English option / other languages available but for now I need to use 2 devices Thank you for your response- for allegro czech rep, language cannot be changed following your instructions unfortunately... | Aplikacja niestabilna, crashuje. | 1 cenzura : książkę akwarelisty z austrii kupisz, a 🧯szczyść borze nie kupisz. służba czuwa. 2. jak ktoś ma konto 20 lat to mu nie wyświetla materiałów dla dorosłych, bo może być niepełnoletni. 3. nękają wiadomościami, 4. sprzedawców traktują jak dłużników 5. kody, opisy, zdjęcia, a jak chcesz kupić spodnie, to w wyszukiwarce nie wyszukasz po długości 🤗 6. pralnia. wystarczy sprawdzić ilość książek w cenie >1500 zł. skoro nikt normalny tego nie kupuje, to jaki jest powód tych ogłoszeń? | Niestety portal promuje i ochrania cwanych sprzedawców...nie polecam staniwczo.Pomimo waszych zapewnień i negatywnych opinii i tak nie bronicie klienta. | edit: the update fixed the issue Installed on my samsung a54 and it's full of bugs, I can't login, I can't contact support or do anything | There are a lot of scammers in this application. | Generalnie cały serwis jest ok, ale to że trzeba płacić za dostawę poniżej 45 zł jest mega irytujące. Jakoś Amazon znalazł rozwiązanie, że płaci się prime za rok i każda dostawa jest wliczona. Kupiłam właśnie 3 produkty z allegro i wszystkim brakuje kilka złotych do 45 i tak naprawdę zakupy są droższe o 30 zł bo ttlke kosztuje przesyłka do każdego z osobna do tego, co za bzdura. Stanowczo coś powinno być z tym zrobione. | Niemal dobry serwis gdyby nie przekierowania i beznadziejne tlumaczenia opisow zagranicznych by 5 gwiazdek | Does not work in the DeX mode. In the browser I cannot use discount voucher (which is limited to the app). | Dużo podchwytliwych powoadomień które na dłuszą metę denerwują. Apka sama w sobie daje sobie radę ale brak mi wiele funkcji jak np udostępnij w allegro lokalnie.... | Today, allegro give me great support to solve my issue. Thank you very much Allegro team, the seller insulting me on the Allegro discussion chat, please kindly take action on him | Niesamowice, nie utczciwe , przyznajace sprzedawcom, ktorzy klamia racje, na temat reklamacji, juz nigdy z tak nieuczciwej firmy nice nie kupie. | always find what I want i trust the sellers | Syf i pół metra mułu, a one box to już padaka na całego nie zamawiajacie do boxa. Stałem 10min przy boxie i dostałem informację że w między czasie paczka została odesłana jak? Przez tunel podziemny. | Dodajcie w ustawieniach możliwość wyłączenia WSZYSTKICH towarów z Chin. Jeżeli w wyszukiwarce można to zrobić przy użyciu filtrów, to w rekomendacjach ciągle pojawiają się jakieś śmieci z Chin. Ludzie korzystają z Allegro do szybkich zakupów na jutro-pojutrze i nie chcą widzieć towarów z Chin w rekomendacjach! | Nie da się zalogować, tylko na Android. Nie dochodzi sms przy logowaniu numerem telefonu | very efficient and well designed app, I use it quite often | 1. Dodajcie wyszukiwanie do wiadomości. Na www jest. 2. Nie da się uregulować rozliczenia z Allegro z poziomu apk. 3. Nie da się wypłacić pieniędzy z poziomu apk. A na www trzeba tą opcję znaleźć przez Google. 4. Ani w apk ani na www nie da się automatycznie od wypłaty odjąć kwoty, która regulowałby rozliczenie z Allegro za sprzedaż. | Od kilku miesięcy więcej nie działa aplikacja, jak działa. Nawet po usunięciu i ponownemu ściągnięciu nic się nie zmieniło. Nawet nie można sprawdzić zakupów zaraz po zaplaceniu, często nawet przestaje działać podczas dokonywania płatności! | Nowa aktualizacja aplikacji ją zniszczyła. Nie wiadomo co gdzie jest w zamówieniu. | Aplikacja super, ale bot robi psikusy i już mnie wkurza. Piszę do sprzedających info, że zwrócili tylko część pieniędzy za zwrócony towar, opuszczam czat i myślę, że wszystko załatwione. Sprzedający nie odpisuje przez tydzień więc chcę się przypomnieć, a okazuje się, że czatbot mi zablokował wiadomość, a ja tego nie zauważyłem... Słabo zadesignowany feature wg mnie. Edit: najpierw oduczcie ją blokować wiadomosci, bo to mocno utrudnia komunikację i frustruje :p | super | ***PLEASE FIX THIS BUG*** while writing a review in English, it prohibits certain words that are contained within an English word. For example I bought some jars and said ""these are sturdy jars"" and I couldn't post it because the word sturdy has the prohibited word ""turd"" in them....this makes writing a review in English almost IMPOSSIBLE. It wouldn't let me write the word associated either and hundreds of other English words. Whoever implemented this needs to be fired for incompetence. | Od lat zawsze zamawiam do jednego paczkomatu, a i tak co któreś zamówienie muszę wyszukiwać go od nowa. Aplikacja notorycznie zmienia mi go przy zamawianiu na inny paczkomat nie wiadomo czemu. | The best app for shopping lovers<3 professional, quick and accurate service | English please | the best e-commerce app and e-commerce store | 👍 | good | Brak przycisku share przy ofertach allegro lokalnie. | Jak zablokowac oferty z CHIN ???? Chyba doczekalismy sie konca Allegro a wydawalo sie niemozliwe. Co za smietnik ! | Ta vec vubec nedokaze vyhledavat v cestine, prijde mi to jak vyhledavace pred googlem v roce 97, hlavne ze mi to uvedenou vec nabizi v reklame v aplikaci spravne, na ten samy dotaz ve vyhledavani to nachazi nerelevantni nesmysly. Opravdu je lepsi pouzivat polskou verzi a translatorem si to prelozit do polstiny. | Durna akcja z shakerem, powinno być ograniczenie jedna okazja na cały event dla jednego użytkownika. Boty skupują 2000 produktów w 2 sekundy. Słabe. | The app refuses to send confirmation codes to my email, and sends confirmation codes by SMS which never arrive!!! I'm going to try the web version. SORT THIS OUT AS SOON SS POSSIBLE!! Then, I'll upgrade my rating. PS Now, it won't even let me SIGN IN without a confirmation code - which I of course haven't received!! | Szukanie jakiejkolwiek konkretnej oferty jest wysoce frustrujące. Komunikat ""Coś poszło nie tak"" pojawia się bez przerwy. Te same oferty wyskakują po kilkadziesiąt albo i kilkaset razy, a więc skrolowanie jest czynnością pozbawioną często sensu. Co gorsza, jest już na ten temat mnóstwo opinii, do których Allegro dopisało zdawkowe odpowiedzi i nic się nie poprawia. Szkoda. | ile tych powiadomień chcecie wysyłać? parę razy dziennie dostaje notyfikację ""jakie to super okazje macie"". edit, odpowiedź na odpowiedź: tak udało mi się znaleźć w androidzie opcje uciszenia was. uff jaka ulga. | I tried to purchase using 3 different credit cards and transactions failed every single times. I use this cards everywhere around the word with no problems (visa & MasterCard, Amex not accepted) | Please, make english language option, I can't find it | I paid for sth. And product is even sent to me for a month. If I cancel the purchase, they ask the product. Product isn't even shipped. How can I send back? :) I cannot get my money back. It's some kind of Ponzi scheme. I will not change this comment until I get my money back. | Allegro Pay dostępne tylko dla obywateli Polski... dyskryminacja | they dont have good menu. Sellers take advantage of this bad app and use it on you. They put fake ads never send the product to you and you have nothing to do. noone cares. sellers know these things and they scam you. never use it i will uninstall it now as well. | Pokazywanie ficzerów przy każdym starcie aplikacji irytuje. | Po ostatniej aktualizacji kiepsko. | Horrible app, the DPD services they use are horrible and have poor delivery services. They lie about having arrived at your location | 1 STAR NOT FOR APP BUT FOR UNRELIABLE POLISH RETAILERS. NO REPLIES TO EMAILS , VERY SLOW SHIPPING ETC. | Autorzy aplikacji bez wątpienia znają dużo języków ale między sobą posługują się wyłącznie baranim językiem. Bo inaczej się nie da wytłumaczyć taki niski poziom polskich aplikacji allegro i olx. Porażka polskiego IT. | Do you think it would be too difficult to start using english in your international shop? | Neustále opravuje správná slova s dojmem, že se jedná o chyby. Například PSP baterie opraví na PSA baterie. Děkuji za mega rychlou odpověď, upravuji hodnocení na 5 hvězd | Brak możliwości podania peselu przy zaznaczeniu faktury VAT przy zakupie od firmy (na stronie po prostu podaje się go w polu nip, tu - ograniczenie ilości znaków nie pozwala na to) | Aplikace se pouze proxy na Aliexpress | Brakuje mi w aplikacji ustawienia domyślnej metody płatności oraz w wypadku nie ustawienia takiej metody zapamiętanie ostatnio używanej | Nie da się ocenić produktów w dowolnej kolejności, tylko aplikacja narzuca ich listę, a poza tym czas na ocenę produktu i transakcji jest zdecydowanie za krótki. Gwarancja trwa 2 lata, a produkt można ocenić tylko przez 90 dni? Jakiś żart, bo często uczciwa, wartościową ocena możliwa jest dopiero po dłuższym okresie użytkowania danego produktu. Podobnie z oceną sprzedawcy, szczególnie gdy wystąpią problemy z procesem reklamacji. Allegro lokalnie to jakaś parodia - raj dla oszustów. | Opłata za sprzedaż jest zbyt duża, nie można odkryć ukrytych zakupów a często o to ludzie się pytają, też nadal nie można nadawać bez etykiety innym słowem olx lepsze. | Slow app, tends to crash all the time, bad UI. Tragic | Strasza firma, straszne zasady, olbrzymi wyzysk. | Za często pyta o zgody (szczególny przypadek jeśli się odmówi, przejdzie do innego menu i wróci na stronę główną ponownie pyta nawet podczas tego samego uruchomienia aplikacji), nie chce zapamiętać odpowiedzi ""nie"". Tona promowanych niezgodnych z wyszukiwaniem elementów. Nie ma co naciskać na profilowanie. Albo się daje możliwość nie zgodzenia się i się ją respektuje, ale się o zgody nie pyta. | Nie mogę odzyskać hasła w aplikacji bo przerzuca mnie do ""Odkrywaj korzyści"" i przestają wyświetlać się pola w które mogę coś wpisać | Ta aplikacja powinna pewnie mieć mniej niż 5 gwiazdek bo pewnie czegoś tam jej brakuje ale daję 5 bo od lat skutecznie korzystam z niej jako kupujący na większą skalę i całościowo względem wielkich konkurencyjnych globalnych graczy apka jak i cały portal są znacznie lepsze. | Very useful marketing place. Recommended | Apka dalej laguje przy scrolowaniu ale przycięte wyniki wyszukiwania zostały już naprawione, dzięki! | Easy to use. More English translation needed | Ciągłe błędy w aplikacji. Często nie działa żadna z zakładek. Edit: aktualizacja nie pomogła | Jako český zákazník Allegro.cz je fakt super, že aplikace umí jen polsky, gratuluju 😂😂😂 UPDATE: oni mi tu i odpověděli polsky 😂 Zkrátka bez znalosti tohoto světového jazyka si Allegro.cz neužijete... Appka se dá do češtiny přepnout samozřejmě, ale to nastavení je hluboko v polském menu a to až poté, co se úspěšně přihlásíte ke svému účtu... | 😵‍💫😁😁 | good quality | Aplikacja przestała otwierać Allegro box zdalnie, nie działa również pokazywanie QR kodu. Można tylko wpisywać cyferki ręcznie. Kaszana. Aplikację odinstalowałem i zainstalowałem ponownie najnowszą wersję z Google Play i to nic nie pomaga. Deweloper twierdzi, że jest jakiś formularz kontaktowy, gdzie mogę zgłosić problem. Ten formularz jest tak ukryty, że go nie mogę znaleźć. Allegro zdecydowanie nie chce, żeby do nich pisać. | Dlaczego ta aplikacja ciągle się wiesza i wysypuje? | Irytujące powiadomienia o promocjach, koszyku, których nie można wyłączyć | The product range is large and the prices are cheap. This is a good. Cons: There is not English interface in the app for Czechia. And the option of delivery to the sale points and boxes is not available in many products. | not the best but great | It does not seem to have the translation option embedded, which makes it unusable by English speaking consumers. | I had horrible experience with this allegro.people, don't believe them they are thieves. They took money for parcel and didn't bring | Thieves they took money and didn't bring our paracel thieves robbers | problemy występujące w poprzednich wersjach naprawione, mogę bez przeszkód robić zakupy w aplikacji. | Wszystko fajnie, ale gdyby tylko ta Alina nie blokowała wysyłania każdej wiadomości do sprzedawcy podpowiadając coś bez sensu. Do tego klikając nazwę produktu, po otwarciu jego oferty, niejednokrotnie okazuje się, że jego nazwa zmieniła się na inną. Brawo. No i opcja ""Połącz te same oferty"" ukryła mi najtańszą opcję. Trzeba uważać. | App | Mam subskrypcję Allegro Start na 1 rok, którą zakupiłem. Z jakiego prawa anulowaliście ją najpierw u członka Smart Family, a teraz także u mnie? Wcześniej kontaktowałem/am się z obsługą w tej sprawie, a także członek mojej Smart Family, ale nie otrzymałem/am żadnej odpowiedzi od was! Oszukujecie waszych klientów! To skandal! | Skopiowalem opis aukcji i wyszukalem - aukcja nie zostala znaleziona. Porazka... I jeszcze co chwila zapytania czy jestes zadowolony z wyszukiwania... Trzeba szukac i kupowac przez google'a albo w amazonie | UX disaster - finding basic options is a nightmare. I'm able to create the offer but it's impossible to find it then in my account. The icon ""sell something"" means nothing - I found it by accident while clicking everything on the screen .... | Nie ma opcji kontaktu z serwisem. | Ups, nie udialo sie wyswietlic Moje zakuoy... Aplikácia jest aktuakizovana... | Thx for google login, but english language ia also essential | Стало удобнее, все открывается быстрее | ALLEGRO.... Dlaczego nie zrobicie jak eBay dla wszystkich sprzedajacych z poza granic Polski, najpierw zakupiony produkt jest dostarczony do kupującego i dwa dni po dostawie dostają kase a zwłaszcza dla Chińczyków którzy zgarniają kasę i znikają likwidując konto i otwierają nowe pod inną nazwą ...ani kasy ani zakupionych produktów !!!! ... ALLEGRO WARTE PRZEMYSLENIA !!!!! | W niektorych wyszukaniach wyswietlaja sie tylko ""promowane"" produkty i nie mozliwe jest skrolowanie aby je pominac bo to zajmie wieki a i aplikacja lubi sobie stanac podczas sktolowania. Fajny feature sprzedajacy placa bo inaczej juz produkt bedzie wykluczony tyle tego jest.. To ma pomoc uzytkownikowi??? Dziadostwo!! | No więc, zainstalowałem apke. Gdzie moje 10 monet? | наверное неплохо | You can't not love this guys (As long as they don't change their policy) | Wyszukiwanie za pomocą foto jest absurdalne. Z aplikacji nie mogę zapisać obrazu z zakończonej (lub trwającej) oferty. Nie otwiera się ""załaduj plik"" aby poszukać podobnego przedmiotu, wystawionego przez innego sprzedawcę. Otwiera się kamera foto. Co ja mam sfotografować, kiedy ja szukam przedmiotu, a jeśli szukam, to znaczy że go nie posiadam. | Zdaję sobie sprawę że nie jest to bezpośrednia ocena samej aplikacji, ale - kurcze chciałam kupić jedną małą rzecz, poszukiwanie jej zajęło mi bite pół godziny. Nie dlatego, że nie mogłam jej wyszukac czy kategorie były źle opisane. Dlatego że platforma dosłownie wpychała mi aukcje ewidentnie chińskie, z wysyłką za 30 dni. Kuchnia felek no, gdybym chciała kupić coś z Chin, weszlabym na Aliexpress. Fajnie byłoby, gdyby jednak za platformą stała jakość, nie ilość. | Can you buy doge | I ordered shoes 10 days ago and still i have not received ,opened discussion but now the seller and allegro represantation has gone quiet | Very nice app","{""1"":99469,""2"":16974,""3"":20369,""4"":16974,""5"":298409}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Allegro sp. z o.o.","Allegro+sp.+z+o.o.","allegro-app-android@allegro.pl","https://allegro.pl/",,"https://allegro.pl/regulamin/pl/zalacznik-5","Allegro+sp.+z+o.o.","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lr15avxI_WMEI_s6JQRiOePhIrdMmp9qbnrY7e1EnLZWuCCqTHMOW9sjEan8lXPeeR8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eeIgv3IRUNfIDf8WMUW2XMr4_MOJf4clnpcPlpn04m_DrD7uAkmjDcTqni3kpP3DS-E","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ii3T-0m07ht8EZ3RNThGHWWzkHUe9DnSxG-YMp9KeyjtLQzlDiUUzEou0OzBtRxPpA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rI2otEC-f0W46ZZIkspko4MaJl6MbnFHhAyE0sMTFZnht1G-bvjlzFiVtxXUnnt9vr4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GEYpz0oVn0iyeDGrzjvu0MEeYWrdN-kYGcQaE3YhWh5_4t9FfvFI343LfLM4WY_FBqM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MpHlwXm5pQjbllM8XgNaXo9GA2wrG0Ysood_WLwxVP2Ii5Bv3iOceTZ7jhD4_FX8QsE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U_du80Hqn5b0XFm062nRK9jpQlp5wsDmvLa7P-_kZPZKY_IPaPiVEk9RUDi5DpinjOSM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CHMG6FikZ70e3lRSdXMOaGd8R1Mp8uSwulaahYW81SLHywC2E_8dm6OXncwmoOFl_ec"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yYhyYZIjfKp3MgHPBtoS0YfFGLxM3qE6JvFv4TRjjIJV4HWDIt_hnFrC3Y-Rc4iv-nE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Emt2jjKbl9bkv1pjsr2eL2RyFT4GoPZ0oe3TOlKs6bRuSoGmwSOYX8jwehyX7vOIjPEb"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jiD28EZxbAlvdI-X8LCRWX3UUSV83Equkb6IGacoi0i4seXb25BTimlSppBd3D-H6qU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yMno7m1_QR0tlHzs8SlPxI8Oy6RcWZJ2Ua6zS5i5T2sEPuawwXoZZh2SibFhM_kF7hI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ewRJiVp9hoaGJ92kgURevjzMtVgrY73LsfqoNTyeMA19AUGpP7PRHtMPBJAGsThQPBDV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nVBleRj4mhnM1QEXLNB2ktpF7oHuu1X_7Zpel2KVfZknseaqUIT6p43eZ7kCZs8uoz0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lCa45GaAiEs05ADNcZaqydZROArz8PIw_eR2uuML3wsR1sHEkIHj--Chae-TxLmbE0ky"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PNasv2cBOzoPFknkH6fF1m3R0aA4HFfzWS7unpvvfXYv4rCGkvk6qPbMjGeZDdaxEw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/e7NV_PPvUipa4FgbKqlAoTz6fK7mEl0spNkVF2QcyOoK8-Qc86p7xDo9SfNYXcQEtU0T"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WRCGa6xhpGPocqfyrlW2EbKQ8ALg1r6ghbu_dTZwJCBYnsuquRkMQfHdN2Nm1IsGdZA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Rki4InnZK_0-XOs_b9KVvNgYc9WI2nfOufRnltUwcvMMz_Ir9_e8HuJNJbHTLz-VUZg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VdqhrwA8vKN5N6TafJrXCkQuw9Bi4P_IN3AGkAMNLhJymiWvFFnjOFWVeTawHqcTk5Bl"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XPfLZPmIDv65x7B1vYsQQcWujK0TG91Lu-AM4vIXbwr0-3uMMGc5L7MfFTTqFEwKc50""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",true,"Jun 30, 2010",1711358658000,"8.62.0","We have the pleasure to present the latest version of the Allegro app. We have added new, functional improvements and eliminated errors.

Samoobslužné pokladny jsou taky úžas a věc.. fronty, chyby, jediná tetka nestíhá vše zachraňovat, brigáda pro Alberta zadarmo. Ne nadarmo.. vsak byl zakladatelem Albert Speer. | Been using this for one year with no benefits... the need to activate coupon to get points to get few crowns discount in incomparable with Tesco benefits where i'm saving hundreds of crowns for the same amount of spending. | Pri pouziti nakupniho seznamu se po odebrani nektere polozky zobrazuji stale. Presneji jde o tri polozky, ktere nelze smazat. Nacitani caroveho kodu je po aktualizaci rychlejsi, ale ocenil bych i moznost jeho vytisteni coz by bylo zdaleka nejrychlejsi. | It would be nice to have a English version of the app. But as I was informed, the app works fine in Czech language. | Pls add english as an option waiting for the language update since more than 2 years now. | No English language. Can't use the app. | Aplikace je celkem pomalá i na rychlém telefonu. Navíc neumožňuje sdílet nákupní seznam se všemi detaily, takže si musíme posílat snímky obrazovky, což je velmi nepraktické. | ""k pouzivaniaplikace je nutne si overit emailovou adresu."" Ok myslel jsem ze jsem ze jsem udelal, a stoji lidi za mnou ve fromte ale ok. ""Emailova adresa je jiz overena"" Ok.... tak me prihlas? zpet tedy. Stejny problem. Ok zaplatim bez slev a kontaktuji zakaznickou podporu. Kliknu ""kontaktovat podporu"", nic se nestane. Parada. Jediny cim by mohla tato aplikace byt jeste horsi je kdyby v ni byly reklamy na raid shadow legends. | Celkom fajn, ale počas prehliadania aplikácie nie je možné zvýšiť intenzitu jasu obrazovky. Rozumiem, že pri skenovaní kódu karty sa jas zvýši, ale prečo je pri ostatných akciách v aplikácii jas znížený tak, že je obrazovka takmer nečitateľná a nedá sa manuálne upraviť, to fakt nechápem. | Aplikace docela fajn, i když je trochu pomalejší. V poslední době nefunguje filtr na recepty při výběru chodu. | No English menu. The digital receipts are hard to access. | naprosto otřesná, invazivní aplikace | nefunkční aplikace, hlásí bez připojení k internetu, ale ostatni appky běží online | Diky teto aplikaci jsem zacal nakupovat v Bille. Dopurucuji IT diletantum, kteri tento soubor bugu zaplatuji, aby se na to vykaslali a nenutili lidi tuto parodii na program pouzivat. Az budete mit neco funkcniho, radi se do Alberta vratime. | Žádné sdílení nákupních seznamů (sdílení textového seznamu názvů položek je k prdu), vlastní nákupní seznamy čas od času zmizí, v rámci propojených účtů má každý jiné kupóny a nabídky, ze seznamu se nejde prokliknout na produkt. | Appka se rychle načítá, což je plus, ale za každých 200 Kč se skutecně kredit nenacte. Btw doporučuju lidem samoobslužné pokladny, protože na obsluhovaných se často něco špatně namarkuje a nebo se při větších nákupech ztratí čast zboží. | Na mobilu dobrý, ale na tabletu je UI rozbité při používání na výšku i na šířku. | Bad app. Tried to register, added phone number, filled verification code and after 10 minutes od loading the app is still stucked on verification. After 5th attempts, I gave up. | Aplikace mě neustále otravuje s tím, že se necítí bezpečně. Navíc je příšerně pomalá v některých sekcích. V obchodě nemám čas čekat minutu na to, až se mi ukáže karta, a to je škoda, takhle ji otevírám jen výjimečně a čárový kód raději skenuji z mé aplikace na poznámky.. Edit: Aplikace je pomalá nezávisle na konkrétní verzi OS, navíc je 2 dny po instalaci. Těm změnám se mi nechce věřit, od začátku je můj kód stejný, ale dám si na to pozor, abych měl v poznámkách aktuální verzi :) | aplikace neumožňuje sdílet více účtů mezi sebou, pouze dva v jeden okamžik. pro mou čtyřčlennou rodinu je toto nepřekonatelná překážka. edit: chápu, že si další dvojice mohou založit další společné účty, nechápu však proč by sdílený účet nemohl probíhat i mezi čtveřicí | Nákupní seznam na problémy - již se mi dvakrát stalo, že jsem si ho doma vytvořil a v obchodě byl prázdný. Teď jsem si ho zkusil vytvořit doma - vydržel mi, dokud jsem nezavřel aplikaci. Po jejím znovuotevření z celého seznamu zbyla jen asi čtvrtina, což je frustrující. Dá se s tím něco dělat? Jinak na Albert aplikaci oceňuji přehlednost, jednoduchost a právě tvorbu seznamu, který ale teď nefunguje. Na druhou stranu je appka pomalejší. Edit: doporučení devs na promazání paměti appky funguje. | Nejlepší ❤️❤️❤️ | Zákaznická podpora jako peklo. Reakce na stěhování im trvá vice než měsíc. Pak došli do "" prosím ukažte účtenku "" . No jasně, ja doma mam jednou skříňku jen na blbé obchodu a jejích "" podpora"" . Nejnižší kvalita zboží a obsluha. Rozhodně nedoporučuji nakupovat v albert. | Stojím u pokladny a chci zobrazit čárový kód. Pustím appku a půl minuty koukám na logo Albert, snad abych nezapomněl, kde jsem. Proč to není tak, že pustím appku a hned vidím kód (pro který tam jdu 9 případů z deseti) a až pak se začne načítat ten zbytek? | Účel, totiž elektronický si sbírat body a kouknout se co je zrovna v akci, pro mě splnilo. Účtenku jsem si taky vyexportoval a mohl jsem ji tak poslat kamarádům aby jsme se podělili o nákup. | Nefunkční aplikace. Hlásí to, že pro pokračování to vyžaduje ověření emailové adresy. Zadáte svoji emailovou adresu a napíše vám to, že adresa již byla ověřena. Kliknutí zákaznické podpory, jako třešnička na dortu, též nefunguje. Ale hlavně že spamování notifikací funguje! | Prosím udělejte něco s tou rychlostí, tohle je opravdu nepoužitelné. Člověk si jde rychle koupit pár věcí, během dvou vteřin má namarkováno, a pak nekonečné dlouho čeká na otevření aplikace, jejímž hlavním účelem je ukázat hloupý čárový kód. | Well | You should take an example from the Globus app. 100 Albert apps for each task isn't really good move in 2022. 16.6.2023 Update: Great move of integrating albert scan into this app. Unfortunately, automatic points topup based on what I scenned isn't working. I still have to scan my Albert card separately, to get the points from shopping, what is not really convenient. | V aktuální verzi (11. 6. 2023, Android 13 May 5 update) nastavuje jas na minimum, bez ohledu na systémové nastavení. Při zobrazení Albert karty se jas vrátí na původní hodnotu, po zavření karty se aplikace opět ztmaví. Při přepnutí do jiné aplikace se jas vrátí na původní hodnotu. EDIT: Z odpovědi je zjevné, že ""Albert Česká republika"" moc nečte, co jim uživatelé píšou. Neřešil jsem, že se při zobrazení ""karty"" rozjasní, ale to, že ZTLUMÍ jas telefonu na minimum, takže je nepoužitelně tmavá. | Albert, stojí za to jíst s aplikací! | Aplikace se neciti nejlepe | Aplikace nejde spustit, po nekolika mesicich jsem apce chtel dat druhou sanci, ale je to bez sance. To je tak, kdyz to programuje brouk pytlik za 5penez. | Dřív jsem rád nakupoval i nekreditové věci, i když byly jinde o něco levnější, protože jsem za každých 300 korun dostal kredit. Teď po zrušení systému už k tomu nemám žádný důvod, a tak v Albertu nakupuji o hodně míň věcí než dřív. Co se aplikace týče, ocenil bych možnost zobrazení počtu kreditů za zboží v košíku (ideálně zobrazení celého infa o zboží po kliknutí). Momentálně musím vyjet z košíku, otevřít celý leták a manuálně zboží vyhledat. | Nákupní seznam se neukládá. Včera jsem si vytvořil seznam pro sebe a dnes se v obchodě ukázalo, že je prázdný! | Please add English support. | Byl jsem navyklý využívat seznam. Nyní pořízený zmizne a v prodejně se dozvím že na seznamu nic nemám😞☹️😠 Tento problém neodstranila ani poslední aktualizace. | English language version as well please. Dekuji. | Just adding my vote for an English version even of it is just a Google Translate, as there a quite a few steps to go through to register and set it up it is hard to do as a non native speaker. | Aplikace je ok a funguje dobře z technického hlediska a UI je ok. Jedno doporučení bych měl. Aplikaci trvá nějaký čas po stisknutí ikony kde je třeba ještě 2x kliknout abych se vrátil na hlavní obrazovku a pak zobrazit čárový kód, což může způsobit další malé zpoždění. Používám mobilní telefon k placení (Google Wallet), kde je možné uložit a používat zákaznické karty rychlji. Bohužel není možné nahrát formát čárového kódu Albert ČR kdežto Holandský Albert Heijn je kompatibilní a dá se nahrát. | Velice casto dojde k tomu, ze se mi po zavreni aplikace smaze nakupni seznam. Jindy zase seznam nereaguje na pridani polozek- vse presto, ze vzdy kontroluji, zda mam aktualni verzi. | Should have English options 🙄 | It's been a year until now no English version 😔😔😔😔😔😔 | Cluttered UI, very slow, containts stuff that is pointless in an app for shopping: recipes (I wonder if they even collect statistics on usage lol), where is sales catalogue? No option to search for items if they are on sales... While websites like kupi.cz can do that for multiple shops/brands. Shopping list search function is very limited in terms of items available, looks like Albert doesn't have much to offer. STEP UP YOUR GAME. This app feels like customer bulling, not like serious product! | Stěžoval jsem si že aplikace u pokladny zdržuje protože místo toho aby při spuštění rovnou ukázala čárový kód tak při každém spuštění obtěžovala s opakovaným výběrem prodejny a neustále škemrala o povolení notifikací. Aplikace stále nemá možnost načíst čárový kód ihned po spuštění ale zdá se že po poslední aktualizaci si již pamatuje prodejnu a respektuje mé nastavení notifikací. Zvyšuji tedy hodnocení z 1* na 3*. | Opravdu frustrující aplikace. Skoro při každém spuštění se buď ptá na povolení lokace, povolení upozornění, nebo mě naprosto odhlásí. Načtení čárového kódu, což je jediný důvod proč aplikaci mám, trvá neuvěřitelně dlouho. Ztrácet čas zákazníků když stojí u pokladny, brilantní. | Aplikace se mi zpočátku líbila, ale ukázalo se, že je velmi problematická. Nejen, že se mi opakovaně stalo, že z ní zmizel pracně vytvořený nákupní seznam, ale téměř při každém spuštění požaduje alespoň dvě z těchto věcí: výběr prodejny/souhlas s cookies/povolení zobrazování oznámení (ačkoliv ho dávno má). Jejím nejpovedenějším kouskem je však vyžadování nového přihlášení a aktivace přes SMS, což s oblibou dělá, když chci zaplatit u pokladny a načíst zákaznickou kartu dostupnou pouze v aplikaci. | Not user friendly in comparison with Rossman and Tesco. I uninstalled it. It is very slow it doesn't not consider what user wants most: lightweight fast application without bloated advertisements. The user should find immediately his/her barcode and the collected points/benefits. Then he she can find quickly a submenu for finding nearby shops with opening time and special offers as well as possibility of online shopping and collect at a chosen shop. | 2022 and I can't choose my language. Hopefully this feature will come out soon. Thanks | Nepoužitelné, nedovolí mi to vybrat prodejnu bez povolení přístupu k GPS. Tím pádem je odepřen i vstup do aplikace. Na co tam tedy máte ten seznam prodejen?! | Pretty versatile app but the automatic scroll when going through this week's sale is literally giving me a HEADACHE! Also, it's unintuitive to find receipts from previous shoppings. Invest in UX | Terrible app, you can't even register e-mail, because it never send you the code. Avoid this. If you really want to save some money and nerves, try another store... | vždycky se z mojí rodiny všichni dobře nají a nakupujeme v Albertu hrozně rádi takže nemám co vytknout:) | Aplikace je dobra ale hrozne pomala, trva ji 5 vterin jen nastarovat abych mohl pouzit kartu. | How to choose English language in the app? | Doesn't support English | Aplikace se načítá moc pomalu, když za vámi stojí fronta lidí značně nepříjemné. Nebudu používat letí z telefonu | Doesn't work at all. Gets stuck at the registration sms. Rubbish. When you try to register five different phone numbers and the confirmation button never appears, it's not a mistake, it is a feature. | Nejde se přihlásit. Po napsání kódu z SMS mi to skočí na předchozí přihlašovací stránku. | The English language is not present.... | No english translation, which makes the experience way more difficult for foreigners | Upravuji své původní hodnocení (1 hvězdička z důvodu zasekavani aplikace). Po posledních aktualizacich je již aplikace svižná a použitelná. Velmi kladně hodnotím možnost vytváření nákupního seznamu a jeho sdileni. | App works perfectly. | Possible to add English Language...? | Like too shop at Albert in Litomersice,,.what I like the most,my Czech is not soo good,all the Albert staff is always very helpful and friendly. | N/A | Kdo vymyslel název Můj Albert, místo Albert? Když chci mít čistou plochu jen s pár ikonami, tak app albert tam nedám, protože ji využívám minimálně - mám ji v katalogu aplikací a ten je abecedně. A při scrollování si vždy položím otázku z úvodu. | Převádění bodů nefunguje, po kliknutí na Poslat body se nestane nic. Sdílení účtu nefunguje, po kliknutí na Chci sdílet svůj účet se nestane nic. | Musel jsem systémově zakázat notifikace protože mi neustále chodily i přes zákaz uvnitř aplikace. | Aplikaci používám jen na zobrazení čárového kódu. Musel jsem zakázat mobilní data, protože aplikace přenáší víc než 100 MB dat za měsíc. Taky nevím na co aplikace potřebuje přístup ke kontaktům. | Mohla by to být skvělá apka, jen je třeba vychytat pár much. Jmenovitě neaktualizují se mi kredity, jsem zaseknutý na 22. Když si chci vytvořit kupón, převod kreditů se neprovede a je třeba restartovat apku, aby se změna projevila. Sekce s recepty je skvělá, ale předpokládal bych, že při změně porcí se mi změní množství surovin. Celkem očividné chyby, nechápu, jak se dostaly přes testy. | Superb | Už asi týden se aplikace sice otevře, ale pak se vše jen načítá, nic se neukáže 😞 | S aplikací jsem velmi spokojen. Bylo by možné přidat do části ""Můj seznam"" výpočet celkové ceny plánovaného nákupu? | Po každé aktualizaci to vyžaduje přihlášení = aktivace přes sms. Po POSLEDNÍ aktualizaci to sice aktivační kód přijme ale aplikace se vrátí zpět na stránku zda li chci registraci nebo se přihlásit a porad dokola... Vtipný taky je odkaz na zákaznickou podporu, na kterou nelze kliknout. Musel jsem aplikaci ODINSTALOVAT a pak znovu NAINSTALOVAT. Posledni dobou mi pripada (pripad i aplikace ZACHRANKA) deveopri kaslou na ztratu prihlaseni po aktualizaci. Je NUTNE, aby i po aktualizaci prihlaseni ZUSTALO aktivni. | Aplikace je velmi pomala a nefunguje sdileni uctu - poslano na podporu A nová verze - teď se mi pro změnu zase neaktualizují kredity v peněžence abych si je mohla použít. Nákup se zobrazil, v historii kreditů jsou taky zobrazené ale v peněžence nic. Edit: odhlásit a přihlásit pomohlo. Hvězdičky budu přidávat až když to bude nějakou dobu prostě fungovat | No English version | Are the developers using this app in Albert stores? It is absolutely frustrating to use it. Notifications pop up over the bar code non stop, app is soooo oooo oooo slow to load. I have to load it while shopping otherwise at the cash register people will curse me if they have to wait for it to load. Check Tesco app for inspiration if you lack it. That app is well xesigned and has a very nice feature:barcode on the first screen. | • Nemožnost přidat jakýkoliv produkt, jen ten který vám ukážou v aplikaci. • Chyba s kartou, ukàzala se tam sleva, i když už byla využitá. • Nesouvisí přímo s aplikací, ale odpovědi v češtině na recenze v jiném jazyce mi připadají hloupé, protože tu žijí tací co mluví jen Anglicky nebo Ukrajinsky. | Aplikace dost pomalu startuje když v obchodě potřebuju rychle zobrazit kod, ale hlavní problém je, že mi nejde načíst kod na samoobslužné pokladně. | Umysl asi dobry, provedeni ... , nejsem schopen vyplnit ani svuj profil, 2x jsem restart.app, nic. Jak k takove veci ma mit clovek duveru, je to skoda, pripada mi, ze je Albert seriozni znacka a tento produkt i dle rezenci tomu vubec neodpovida. | How do you change to English? | Only Czech no English is some problem for me. | The application text is too small on the screen. The change of application language isn't possible. | I love the shopping list and how I can easily add products there, that is really helpfull especially during shopping - everything in one place 👍 BUT - the SLOWNESS of the app makes me crazy 😡 Enjoy waiting tens of seconds before something happens... It's like you're not even trying to fix it. | Proč mne nahodile (asi po aktualizaci) odhlašuje (ač 8/4/21 bylo řečeno: víme o tom a opravujeme). Práce se seznamem vybraných položek: proč je tak pomalé odebírání položky ze seznamu, proč se pořadí sekcí občas nahodile mění? Detail zboží nejde ze seznamu otevřít. Fotka na detailu zboží nejde zoomovat (např. přečíst si text ""složení"" na obalu), ale vzhledem k tomu, že je často fotka jen z pohledu bez složení, tak to vadí jen málo. Nevidim efekt volby preferencí bez lepku, bez laktózy. | Většinou funguje, jak má, občas je poněkud pomalá a trvá to. Odpověď vývojáři: co aplikace chce, je optimalizace na straně vývojáře - ne radu, aby si lidé mazali mezipaměť. Aplikace neúměrně spotřebovává zdroje, tak s tím něco udělejte (namísto rady ""mažte si paměť). / Na druhou stranu je aplikace velmi progresivní: sbírání bodů v apce namísto lepení koleček na papír a vytváření/sdílení společných účtů v apce jsou funkce, které leckdy konkurenti pořád ještě neznají. | Nevidim uctenky starsich nakupu jen toho posledniho. Recepty se nezobrazují, jen filtry. Zkousel restart i smazat keš. Doporučení vývojáře Odhlásit/Přihlásit odstranilo nyní veškeré problémy. Načetly se i kreditní body, které tam předtím nebyly :-) Díky! | Podporuji své kamarády, kteří se na vývoji podíleli, pěti hvězdičkami ❤️ | I was surprised that there is no option to switch the language to English... useless | Aplikace je nepřehledná a chybí možnost smazat historii nákupů (účtenek v aplikaci). | I like and want this apps but I maybe this apps is only for this country people not in foreigners because no English we need to translate and it's hard so I uninstall this apps | Čtení karty v mobilu funguje velmi špatně na samoobslužných pokladnách | Aplikace neustale zamrza a nefunguje. | Moc praktická věc, aspoň se trošku ušetří za papírové účtenky | Dobrá aplikace. Ale nedostávam body. Vůbec... UPD: teď dostávám body. +1 hvězda :) ale 15 body jsem stratil v tento kampaní. Tak pouze 4 hvězdičky | The slowest app I have ever seen. | Dobrá appka, funkcionalit dosť, ale tragicky pomalááá... | stopped working after update, lost all credits | Dobrý nápad, docela i funguje, dokonce se zlepšila rychlost loadovani aplikace, což byl ohromný opruz pokaždé u pokladny. Ale. Dostat na obrazovku můj kód je prostě porod. Dneska mi to přes čárový kód zobrazilo 'notifikaci', takže nešel načíst. Pokus o dismiss notifikace skončil zobrazením stránky s nabídkami...omg. | Přestalo fungovat převádění kreditů na slevu, takže už mi bohužel k ničemu není... Edit: Pomohlo to, děkuji! | Aplikace na zacaku fungovala,ale ted uz mi nenacita nakupy,tim padem ani body za produkty. Takze je mi vlastne k nicemu :( | Very slow application | Vyuziti nasbiranych bodu naprosta tragedie. Nasbiral jsem za x mesicu vice nez 200 bodu, promenil je na slevu v Kc. Tu jsem dnes chtel uplatnit. Na terminalu to napsalo chybu nacteni vernostnoliho programu. Pani z obsluhy to odpipla a nic. Zaplatil jsem plnou cenu nakupu a bidy fuc. Na muj dotaz me pani odkazala, abych volal na podporu, ze mi nepomuze. Ne diky. Jedina pridana hodnota je fakt, ze diky tomu nemusi tisknout uctenky. Ztrata casu to pouzivat :(((. Rozhodne nedoporucuju!!! | Neskutečně pomalá a kredity se často nenačtou. Asi nejjednodušším řešením je aplikaci smazat a pokud chce někdo využívat výhody věrnostní karty, tak začít nakupovat v řetězci, který má fungující věrnostní program. | It clould be a good app. But it is problematic and toooooo slooooooow | I přes vypnuté všechny kategorie notifikaci mi aplikace každou chvíli nějakou akci v notifikaci hlásí | Another request to have English language in the app. | Dvě hvězdičky proto, že se mi párkrát podařilo ušetřit díky nasbíraným bodům.. ale aplikace jako taková je katastrofa, zdlouhavé načítání, než se vůbec otevře a načte kód, a navíc se mi teď zasekla úplně a už se mi neaktualizuje ani nabídka, ani body.. | No translation renders it useless. Good try | Aplikace je žalostně pomalá i v novější verzi. Práce s nákupním seznamem je za trest. | Pointless app | Dobrý den, nefunguje mi v peněžence přesunutí kreditů. Jsou nějaké možnosti jak to opravit? Děkuji. K Dobrý den, už mi to funguje. Odhlásila jsem se a znovu přihlásila. Děkuju za tip. Klára | It is trying to do a good thing and be a good app, yet it logs me off every second day, it shows me unmovable pop ups again and again on the startup and all of that for the app, that 95% of usage is right at the cash desk! I didn't use my card over a dozen times already because the app did one of these stupid things, not letting me to the barcode itself with a bunch of people in a queue after me. | The app is not bad (from the UI perspective) but the fact that is so slow makes the whole experience quite bad 🙁 99% of the time I just want to open the app and show the barcode ... To get to this point it literally takes almost forever...and at this time I'm about to pack my food but I can't because I'm waiting for the app to open and then waiting for the barcode to show 🙁 | Nápad dobrý, ale aplikace je neskutečně pomalá a když ji mám u pokladny spustit a ještě u toho vykládat nákup, tak je to fakt za trest. | Aplikace je absolutně nepoužitelná, dlouho se načítá, nato že celá pointa aplikace je ukázat čárový kód tak to absolutně nezvládá | Cokoliv chci zadat do nákupního lístku, zboží nenajdu nebo ve výsledcích figuruje hlavně alkohol. Ne zrovna nejzdravější zboží. Edit: Když nejsem registrovaný a používám aplikaci poprve, tak žádné preference nemám. | Use case: open the app, open the barcode. What always happens: popups (inside the app) appear on top of the barcode. Have you tested it at all? | Dobrá appka, jen to načítání je dost zdlouhavé, když potřebuji rychle ukázat kartičku u pokladny. | No option to delete profile. Weak promotions: collect 20 credits and change them for 20 czk. Really? :) | One more to the English language version requests, but one more thing. In my penezenka / nakupy I have 17 points (body) but in penezenka / body it shows only 4 (Later edit after developer response) -> I am missing 13 points in the application. There should be 17 according to the purchases I've made, but there are only 4. I've lowered one start because of this response you've made. | Registrácia je možná len pod českým telefónnym číslom | English version still missing. | Aplikace je dost pomalá, interakce dost dlouho trvají - nevím, jestli mám na něco čekat nebo tapnout znovu, protože první tap aplikace nezaregistrovala. Mobilem to není. Zároveň swipování mezi obrazovkami není úplně dokonalé. Často se děje to, že chci swipnout něco v rámci obrazovky, ale swipne se mi celá obrazovka a naopak. Odhlašování a přihlašování se do aplikace na to nemá vliv. | Na účtence chybí informace o tom kolik kusů daného produktu bylo zakoupeno. To je zásadní nedostatek!!!! Přidejte možnost současně nastavit jednu prodejnu typu supermarket a jednu typu hypermarket. Obě budou aktivní jako ""moje prodejny"" (nabídky se výrazně liší a pro jejich zobrazení je velmi nepohodlné měnit ""mou prodejnu""). Aplikace bude mít záložky ""můj supermarket"" a ""můj hypermarket"" a zobrazí nabídky z aktivní záložky. Bez tohoto je aplikace dost nepohodlná na používání. | Aplikace se otevira velmi pomalu a po otevreni jeste minutu nereaguje a nacita se. Pri nutnosti otevreni u pokladny je to velmi neprijemne. | Kdyz jsem dneska chtel nascanovat kartu (resp. jeji carovy kod), byl tento kod relativne dlouhou dobu castecne prekryty jakymsi upozornenim, coz u pokladny neprijemne zdrzovalo. Take zmena orientace telefonu zpusobovala, ze kod zmizel a objevila se jina obrazovka. Zvazil bych, jeli nutne, aby obrazovka s kodem karty zvysovala jas telefonu na maximum. Z nejakeho duvodu mne tato vlastnost rozciluje. Jinak dobre, zejmena ocenuji, ze nemusim myslet na papirove uctenky. | Stokrat jsem uvadel svoje tel.cislo abych se mohl zaregistrovat a nic. Zadna neprisla | Kód poslán až na 15tý pokus. Registrace vyžaduje trpělivost. Nefungují tam bodíky - nic nevidím, nevím, nač sbírám, nejdou mi ani vyplnit údaje - nefunkční Link. Jinak app dobrý nápad, cením nákupní seznam a přehled... | Translated on Google Translate: Dobrý den. Možnost přeposílat nasbírané body někomu z rodiny na jejich aplikaci by se hodila. Děkuji. Taky anglicky překlad. | Nice app | Opraveno. Vše funguje. Díky 😉 | Neskutečně ale fakt neskutečně pomalá aplikace. Na mobilu za 10tis kde všechno běhá bleskem, byste z tohoto při používání zestárli. Vytvořit si nákupní seznam tady...to byste vyletěli z kůže. | Ocenil bych export účtenky v nějakém strojově čitelném formátu jako třeba textové pdf, html, txt, json,... (ne jako obrázek) a možnost automaticky zasílat účtenky emailem. | Requires a phone number, which I am not willing to provide | Vyžaduje mobilní číslo na registrace. Tak to ne. E-mail by měl stačit. | Bylo by dobré implementovat seznam v aplikaci na cloudovem reseni, kde by mohla vepisovat celá domácnost na různých zařízeních a všichni by stále viděli synchronizovany seznam. Taktéž vyřešit společnou appku pro X členů domácnosti, i když appka naštěstí povolí přihlásit se na více zařízeních pod jedním tel. číslem. Diky | Málem jsem dal 1 hvězdu, ale nakonec se stačilo odhlásit a znovu přihlásit a většina problému zmizla. | Naprosto k **** aplikace a jí podobné, když už děláte tyto appky tak by vám alespoň měla fungovat registrace! | Otřesné, prakticky žádné funkce nefungují. Prodejna nelze vybrat /změnit, účet nelze sdílet, preference nelze upravit, nic se nezobrazuje. Aplikace naprosto nanic. | Takovou hrůzu jsem už dlouho neviděl. Nastavení oznámení přepnu, uložím, vrátím se zpět a je to naopak. Účtenka se mi nevytiskla, ale v aplikaci je nastaveno, že chci účtenky. Navíc v aplikaci moje účtenka chybí. Bod jsem nedostal, že je digitální v aplikaci, ale v ní není a je nastaveno, že body nesbírám v aplikaci, navíc to nejde změnit, a že aktuálně ani neprobíhá žádné sbírání. Tady snad nefunguje jediná věc. | It's been 3.5 months since the last English request. Has this function been added yet? If not, why not? And when can I look forward to this? I will download it again when it does. | Mnohem lépe zvládnuté, než třeba stejná aplikace od Lidlu, oceňuji hlavně to, že už není třeba vytisknout ani centimetr účtenky. Velikou vadou na kráse je ovšem to, že nefunguje se samoobslužnými pokladnami a není to u nich ani nikde zřetelně napsáno, takže to zjistíte až když si na konci nákupu zavoláte na pomoc obsluhu... | Moc pěkně udělané, akorát by to chtělo více kreditů! :D | Celkem dobré, má to velký potenciál ke zlepšování. Občas se seká. | V nejnovější verzi už funguje i pro jiná města než Jihlava. A vypadá celkem dobře a přehledně. | Funguje jen v Jihlavě, nechápu proč. Betatesty aplikaci obvykle probíhají nějakým způsobem neveřejně právě z důvodu toho aby nedocházelo k situacím jako že nehotová věc se dostane na veřejnost a uživatelé sem budou úplně zbytečně pálit hejty. Anebo se jedná o hotovou aplikaci a Albert se z nějakého důvodu rozhodl že bude použitelná jen v Jihlavě. Havlíčkův Brod na jaře 2021, Brno léto 2021, Praha 2022 a zákazníci v Aši a Ostravě se můžou těšit v roce 2025! | Nepoužitelné zřejmě mimo jihlavu | Nerozumim proc je to jen pro Jihlavu? | Nákup položek dle receptu. 👍 | Super recepty! | A bodíky sbíráte? :-)","{""1"":1441,""2"":344,""3"":588,""4"":741,""5"":3687}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Albert Česká republika","Albert+%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+republika","info@albert.cz","https://www.albert.cz/aplikace",,"https://www.albert.cz/podminky-pouzivani","Albert+%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+republika","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tX2x_y-xnYFUTb-QMuD9lKidHBXlLSrIdLlNwBraPLwrQvQ2oao776vofYuQjeoQ3ZU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bkcmgDP9kfkl4Vg6wxhAaMVv4pwZg_IyRfsLbwkJkND3uchPFzCf2Y0pilCwcYZdb7A","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d3DPjdFFv_v-ikT-RtoouEFWxCoGsq5nbUUEdHrcRxqbeMU2Q_IJDy4sa0KbbrHuqaGc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gvZgQflRkCYTOP46wG8Fo386jTdj1WfpD2E2rA4Gbv5fTDspAH8FOb7YHFATLjzPYB-Z"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ciaxGultQyxMJGgmVihNVWLoDK97lB_h66X0lWmmRDYYVmcPmTWbRf1Pdd5sbaqTIijq"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zyr-nuIZfgmhU6IMwBOl_Y4MPqXinsxq2Xn3kKKJtORgU72OK9sx_bIbn8nP11nZtrM2"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aXAZ-Vix-7SDZdTNwW7Ax1_dH6B_dnVo16vgccpwG8Z0EokT0awDR3fg99ouNIZJa88""]",,,,"PEGI 16",,false,"May 26, 2020",1710541054000,"3.1.0","Nová verze, která je plná vylepšení.<br>Zapracovali jsme třeba na cenovkách, aby pro vás orientace v nich byla co nejsnazší.

Also wish the shopping list icon was on the bottom instead if having to go on the 3 dots as I use that more than the partner offers. | Almost Every time i open app i need to log in, fix it. | Fantastic | The app malfunctions. It freezes at the image of mickey mouse type image holding a cup. Had to restart to getting past this image. Butit happens every time after single use. If | Can't load Northern Irelang stores | Never had a problem with Lidl. | The stop are lovely helpfalpha | Good 👍 👍 👍 10out10 | Why? The Lidl app was much better. Lidl plus app opens on browser... very bad 😞 | Keeps sending meat vouchers when I selected vegetarian. Almost all of the vouchers are for high sugar content foods and bakery items | Love lidi | Doesn't work in Northern Ireland. | Lidl Display items shows discount price while billing its shows much higher price !!! | Începând cu luna martie, aplicația a început să meargă prost... La plățile mai mari, bonul apare mai târziu în aplicație. Uneori și după câteva zile. | not realy oriented towards loyal clients. Also, old school trick - get discount if (you purchase for certain amout) litery is getting on my nervs. Consider this - the info is, as always, hardly visible, and you don't notice it. As a client, you feel cheated. | Even though the app is in Dutch English and German the moment you choice country Portugal it forces you to use Portugese Language very backwards... | Too much useless notifications, too little functionality | Ever since I recieve d the message to upgrade the Lidl Plus app I have been unable to access the app. Each time I try to download I receive the message the it will be installed soon. After at least twenty attempts I despair! | The security attendant, Omar, was really helpful. It made shopping in Twickenham Lidl a very pleasant experience. | Pop ups are useless and annoying. The program often delays purchases because of sudden and slow upgrades. | What can I say I spent half my pension at most an d bur.arrad lidel shops I am an addiction to lidel | Easy to use. | This is a good application - if you don't mind the (sometimes) bad connectivity and problems at the checkout. In Sweden we still have those plexiglass shielding to protect the cashiers/employees. Don't get me wrong - it's a good thing they're there, because you never know when there's another pandemic... It's usually a pain in the **** to reach the QR-reader with your phone (because of the glass). But, if you're hunting for bargain prices I suppose that's the price you have to pay... 😉 | We love aldi for its quality goods especially there meat selection 😍 The beef & chicken has to be thee best around 😋 we shop in other stores like tesco and asda etc but always go to aldi for our meat . | Each time I try to run the app, I have to uninstall and reinstall it all over again and again. It gets stuck at the loading screen. Otherwise, it is not that bad. I liked the previous one a little more when browsing the daily catalogues. | Hello its Carol & Derek Johnson here we are pensioners in our 70s, been shopping with you since you opened in Chester, I retired at 69 & riddled with Osteoarthritis & Derek has chest Infections & heart problems, you are our wonderful day out in our week thank you so much we love it. | Generally works ok .. You do have to wave your phone around in front of the sensor and get the beep to know it registered but you can do this almost any point even after the shop total comes up. Big negative is no way to add a shop reciept later if you forgot to use it or the system is down. Big plus is you get actual money off the shop after spend 200 in a month ie not just coupons. You do have to ""activate"" the coupons before use but generally they last a week befor expiring. | It looks good, pity we can't link accounts within a household. We both shop in Lidl, but rarely at the same time. Any chance of this becoming a feature? | Easy, accessible | I want to change the language without changing the country. Please fix it 🙏. | Always asks for update without access to Lidl card when you have to present it at the cashier | Excellent | Great shop .low prices | Η λίστα αγορών δεν είναι βολική, γιατί από τη στιγμή που θα αποθηκεύσω κάποιο προϊόν δεν μπορώ να δω ούτε από ποια ημερομηνία είναι διαθέσιμο ούτε την τελική του τιμή με την έκπτωση. Η παλιά εφαρμογή ήταν περισσότερο βολική σε αυτό το κομμάτι. | Ne marche pas | Excellent vibes plus top value. | Lidl pay doesn't let you add your bank connection. Useless app | Excellent service and good quality goods | Today I became that guy who held the queue because this dumb app demanded an update in order to be used. Couldn't dismiss the update, it was mandatory! | Always insists on updating when I am at checkout! (even though auto update is active) | Apparently there is no lidl in my area! Yes there is and it was actually the lidl in my area that told me to download.. | Абсолютно нефункционално приложение. Списъкът за пазар не визуализира информация за продукта, цена и от и до кога е съответната цена. Напълно безполезна функционалност. Останалите функционалности са ми безинтересни и дори не ги ползвам. Дори и 1 звезда е много. | Unable to find the nearby lidl location. I live in Northern Ireland | No merece la pena. No beneficios. Una pérdida de tiempo | Great app | Пренесете функционалността на списъка с продукти за пазаруване от старото приложение - в новото няма : дата на валидност, картинка на продукта, линк към самия продукт с описание на улсловията и т.н., . Самият списък не е интуитивен и не е сложен да удобно и лесно място , а наврян в секция ""Още .."" | Good app, but too many updates, which is a pain when I'm in the queue. Less updates please | Good | Scam. The treats that are awarded from virtual scratch cards in app are always missing from the store | Won't allow signon in app. Just hangs. Waste of time, cannot shop in Lidl now, as I don't get the favourable offers. Tried uninstall/reinstall. Still hangs at signon. Store assistant suggested it was my phone. Samsung s23 ?? | Din pacate, in ultimul timp ii trebuie aplicatiei peste 1 minut sa se incarce..iar de multe ori nici nu reuseste incarcarea.. | Not very useful to find what you want compared to the old app | От две, горе долу ставащи приложения да направиш едно, с толкова садистичен UI и UX е колосално постижение. Първо не можеш да си отвориш картата за отстъпки по 15 секунди, заради някакви безумни реклами, и то докато чакаш на касата и губиш времето на персонала и хората на опашката. Второ менюто е като наръчник за атомна централа. Трето никакъв UX в секцията за избор от текущи промоции. Четвърто, никакъв ред и интуитивност. Пето, липсват интегрирани платежни методи. Шесто... няма място.... | Please add the favorites buttons with icons, prices etc as the lidl app. Shopping list is not usefull | Goodbye bugs? Hello improved performance?? An explanation would be nice as to precisely what's updated. This time I WAS in the queue when the app forced me to update but the assistant was able to use my phone number so I could receive my 30% discount on my sticky buns! At least let us choose to update at a later time! | Having to activate coupons feels like living in the stone age. I know you're a budget chain but come on... | No good for people who haven't got internet on their phone, I've been shopping in Lidl since the day it opened over 20yrs and don't get any coupons off vouchers not good enough for older people who do all their shopping in Lidl x | I'd like to make a few suggestions: 1. Activated coupons to automatically move up first so that the user can immediately see them and remember the products they activated without needing to scroll down. 2. Add a 'Feedback' section in the app. 3. Shopping list is not comparable to the 'Lidl' app that unfortunately is not used anymore. The current shopping list in 'Lidl plus' is not useful. | The best | Help ,but to long quickly, | I don't have enough memory left on my phone to update the Lidl app without deleting something else, which is really annoying. So I can't use the Lidl app at all now! | App advice, update available, you update the app press open to get message update available. Not a great experience | Absolutely hate it. I used to use the old Lidl app to view the weekly offers and add to favourites what I need to buy. It was simple and very convenient, but, unfortunately, no longer available. Lidl Plus has the option to create a shopping list, but it's totally useless - you can't click on the entry to open it for details. It's just text with no details, price or starting date. | Great! | Often creats difficulty in opening the App | Very detailed information about their products. | The animation of the football flying towards me and then application doesn't do anything. That's exactly what I need when I came here to charge my car or standing in line while people waiting. Brilliant | Good shopping app, pity is not available in English. | Very well stocked and easy to get around and prices r also great | Άχρηστη εφαρμογή δεν δουλεύει,δεν στέλνει ποτέ το κωδικο επαλήθευσης. | Good | All good. 4 stars given only because we could do with a bit more variety. The tills in the Pinner branch have very restricted space on the check out counter and ffor trolleys which makes loading the trolley very difficult for cistomers. Thanks | Trash app | Can't open at all since new update | Very easy! | The app doesn't have my local stores to pick | Takes forever to open | i have to install/uninstall the app everytime in order to be able to open. since this last version, it doesn't open anymore, I cannot use it | ok | Excellent | I.like.shoping.Ldle.beause.there.always. reduced.price.and.there.are.differen choices.of.goods.to.choce.from. | The lidl plus app does not identify stores in Northern Ireland. | I tried on several occasions and never got a code from SMS 😕 | Bad app !#! The old app (wihthout plus+) is 100% Better. | The shopping list in this app is utterly useless! Items are listed without pictures and without the dates when they are available. No way to plan your shopping like this. After the other Lidl app (which was great for that functionality) was recently discontinued, there should have been a revamp of certain features in this one for a smooth transition to using just this. | terrible app, they don't make any effort to make it better, all discounts dont make any difference when you buy something, its a scam app. | The app's lost it quite frankly! Where's the £2 off £50 spend coupon? The sratchcard is useless. I dont want to win favorina eggs and Easter stuff, I've been winning this all week, amazingly don't win at other times! Bring good coupon offers in from toiletries/laundry range too. Fed up of seeing sausages and wine, coffee and irrelevant offers. | lt was disaster we 2 Senior Cotizens were sent on a wild goose chase to Swords branch having been told we would get our wood logs for the fire there ŵdrove all the way out from Drumcondra to find nothing the chap at the Till told us no branch in Swords stocks them anymore having driven out all the way out there .How can Head get it so wrong. | My raring isn't changed at all. You are tricking customers and it is really annoying. Why do not ACTIVATE your specials automatically??? It is pissing me off. Not those 70c I loose, your system robbing those small bits is not fair | You ruined the ""Lidl"" app with the nice shopping list and forced us to use the shopping list in the Lidl Plus app which is horrible. | Good | App is ok but staff not scaning discounted item's as discounted but normal price! Can't login! No easy way to restore password! | Since the last update it takes literally minutes to start the app. I am not a football fan, the mascots in the beginning do not worth it. | Love lidl | After update ow it takes too long to startup! | The recently added shopping list feature is totally useless in its present form. In the now discontinued Lidl app, the shopping list feature was near perfect. | It was good | Not possible to install this application for more than one country. I would like to use it even when travelling abroad. | Slow | For some reason I can only select Lidl GB stores? I am not in GB, I don't live there, my phone isn't set to there, I don't have a vpn there. Why can I only get the British version of the app all of a sudden? It was fine before? | All is well | Remove the bear. I want to use the app and not watch some unneeded animation with too much wait time. | I enjoy shopping with you ☺️ | Very good | Horrible | The leaflet on Lidl was better. Do it like tha | Terrible, I cant to see number of my card. It is too hard to make a registration. | Even the home shop canon not be selected. Not from the map where YouTube Canon see the Shop but it Canon not Best selected by the adressi or the shop's name. Using of the App is impossible! | Shopping list of Lidl plus compared to lidl shopping list is total disaster no photos, no price, no promotion date. Who created this terrible app? Don't stop the old lidl app from 15.03. I rate this app below 1* | As always good experience 👌 | As an o. a. p. i find it difficult yo use this app and more difficult to find the items on this app in store. I always feel rushed at checkout . | This app is a complete head melt from start to finish, the only good thing about it is the digital receipts. | Overraskende god og velfungerende app. | Good | Everything I need at lower prices than any one else and quality and servicec | Excellent | After the last update you see the products on leaflets | after latest update doesnt work | Good | Sunt multumita pt ca au produse minunate oricand. | Got charged for a free bag... | Very good lidl market and staff | New update: app is working better these days. Prizes are mostly bakery items though (rarely anything for people who have to stay healthy). The app is also an annoying football advert now. | Bad marketplace | No English if you live in the Netherlands | Shopping list - Incantata de faptul ca la ultimul update s-a adăugat opțiunea listei de cumpărături, chiar aveam nevoie de asta, dar cred ca mai are nevoie de niște îmbunătățiri. As prefera sa pot vedea mai multe informații despre produsele pe care le adaug direct din aplicație, cum ar fi: din ce oferta fac parte(de luni sau de joi), o poza cu produsul, pretul etc | Super | The wishlist should show picture of the said product if added from the digital offer list | It is not working..... | Useless, if you go in the market, 5pm you have nothing to buy from coupons! This heppens all time! And this includes basic things such as fruit, dairy products!","{""1"":188860,""2"":49812,""3"":81538,""4"":259111,""5"":1032235}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Lidl","7666509303365930182","lidlplus@lidl.com","https://www.lidlplus.com","Lidl Digital Trading GmbH & Co.

I have to uninstall and then reinstall. | nice👍😊 | How would you NOT use Duolingo??? | very bien | it's good okay. 😤too good. I learned spanish 🇪🇸 100%℅ like to hablo frances! Por que? yo no se. 😙I mean like, bro | Very good, I literally flex on my friends that I can speak Japanese, And: I teach one of them how to speak Japanese so we can talk about things that I only want to tell one of them. | La aplicación es impresionante, cada palabra aprendida recomiendo anotarlo en un cuaderno, también estoy aprendiendo a la par con videos de YT (Soy Miguel Idiomas), modo autodidacta. Aprenderán de forma asegurada el inglés :) . Good luck everyone. | Great learning app | It works really well, but I hope they can add Tagalog lessons because that's the reason why I downloaded this. | Good way to learn it is just irritating that you lose hearts and have to work them back but if you pay money you get unlimited hearts but a good app and makes learning languages easy they made learning German realy easy | pls don't hurt my family | helpful | A few flaws. 1st, when doing a speaking Lesson, you get 3 tries to get it right. This is fine. The thing that bothers me is that when I speak, sometimes it doesnt hear me & I lose a heart. Im learning portugues and I speak spanish. Meaning that the way I speak in portugues is pretty acurate. I shouldnt lose a heart because it couldnt hear me. 2nd, the XP potions. When Im doing a lesson to continue my streak, I dont need a potion. When Im motivated to do, let me use one. I Dont want to waste them | It's very excellent application for speaking English | Duolingo is teach me so much I now I can speak the language I chosen it so helpful people should download it. | An awesome and use friendly app. makes learning other languages fun | The best | Other than my family missing this is good | this is nice! I loved it | Very good way to learn a new language. I'm now learning German, Irish, and Italian. | it is grate for learning more than other apps | Duolingo is a great app. It makes learning feel like a game! The only downside is that you have to pay to have no adds and unlimited hearts. (you get 5 hearts a day after a mistake -1 one) | super easy and fun | It was good until the time I miss my lesson, there's always some green bird outside of my house looking at me menacingly. | day 2 and i know how to greet and introduce my self in Vietnamese | Not as good as it should be. Translating isn't the best way to learn a language, and worst of it, that continues in advanced levels! Better use Bussu, another similar app or even class lessons! | I'm liking the app and bought The 1 year sub in november. Now I can't upgrade the plan to family without paying a whole new sub, the amount I'm charged is the same for someone without an active sub. I can't find where to talk to someone for support, so I'm sending this review. | Daily Refresh became useless recently: it goes over the same ~10 topics every time, while the course has a lot more. There's a fresh bug. 1) Start the last lesson of Daily Refresh before midnight, and finish it after midnight. 2) Next day this 6th lesson will be unavailable as if already completed. That's a pity: in all other scenarios it's the lesson starting time that counts. | good | I like this app, but as a shortcoming, it does not explain enough about the syntax or grammar. It would be beneficial to understand why something is an error, and not just guess at the correction. | I was charged over 55 dollars without notification or my authorization, under EU regulations, legal action will proceed quickly if I am not reimbursed my money. I will make it my mission in life to ruin you if I dont get my money back... | They keep adding more lessons but instead of getting more content to study, I find myself going through the exact same exercises time and time again after they do an ""upgrade"". This app is not made to help you study but to keep you interacting with it longer (and spend more money). | Can get boring Early please don't come after my family 😭 | very nice | It helps me a lot . Because I didn't know any French so know now | Easy and gamified way to learn any language. Great community and several users. My only issue is it doesn't count how often you took a lesson per day, and only focuses on streaks. I, as well as some of my friends with busy lifestyles, would like to keep count of how many days I signed in for a lesson, and not focus on prioritizing my streak once i lose my streak, I suddenly lose interest in learning the language itself through duolingo | c'est très bien | the French examples often do not sound like native french speakers | amazing learning soo much Arabic and much more languages just wow | I trained for more than two or three years learning German but now I have left it as duo is becoming more pay to win Example: before you had unlimited hearts for free but now pay to win Before there were no ads And I know these changes are done as duo can get more money from ads and super Duolingo because it has became famous so it can show more ads | goooooooooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!! | im learning polish rn and this app is great | good | great refresher | Some of the exercises are very repetitive and not very relatable. I would prefer a useful travelling section for holidays rather than endless drilling around students and universities and green t-shirts | It's an amazing app, if you really want to learn languages and focus, it gives amazing lessons and in 2 weeks you can learn multiple words and learn quickly, and amazingly. | superbe application très pratique | Un-Islamic words like pork and alcohol keep coming up. It's like they did it on purpose. It is not clear whether they are teaching language or missionary work. | I am enjoying learning here because I have learned more the teacher is more tolerant of my mistakes and I find a way to proceed. Other programs I could not manage to advance. | kida isk | I did Many things👌 | a really easy and intuitive way to learn the basics of a new language | Beautiful learning game teaches me SO so much | I like recent changes to the platform and have updated my review in light of this. Still buggy in places, the speech input is inaccurate sometimes, and it would be nice if you could select learning a language in another language without changing the setting globally on the app. Also, each time on the path should give you an option to test forward. The next section is too far, and each time is so tedious that day learners will get bored reiterating same words. But otherwise, this app is improved. | Great app | great app | please come into Duolingo | i like this app | I love the ways that they teach people various languages and how they try to make it fun! The way they teach me how to speak spanish makes me think of it as a game! Also, a really important part of Duolingo is that it efficiency teaches you the language you wanna learn, and it does! I know a LOT more spanish than I did before I tried Duolingo.😊 | it's great and easy to learn things but there's not really much stuff to keep you motivated | It's such a good app. It's fun. It helps you learn languages. I love it😁😁😁😚😚😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😅😍 | this is probably the number 1 learning app | This is really helping me with my languages and is also really helpful with my younger siblings. | I like Duolingo it's very beneficial for learning language from English to any other. I'm learning Italian through this. I give five star for this software.

What just happened with this update?!?! I was learning Chinese, now there is a total mess. Sections have changed units, yet supposedly I have them up to gold, there is so much new characters in those ""mastered"" parts that I don't even know what to do (except that I know I have to reset all my progress till now and star again)... After the update even lessons stopped working properly, there is no progress on them. | it is misting | it is fun and fun | ممتاز | I like this except there's no Malaysia | this is a very nice app it has helped a lot to learn Japanese and Korean so I can watch without subtitles thanks a lott | Ridiculous that you have to pay on TOP of your yearly subscription. If you need to take tests, you must pay or they kick you off midway through. I need repetition, through TESTING. It is the only way I learn, but with this app, I am constantly being told I have to pay or quit session. I'm in the middle of my free trial, which is identical to the paid subscription, so I don't know if I will continue and officially join due to that. Such greed! Also, the lay out is quite messy & confusing. | it's so much fun and I love the meme | :) DUOLINGO is a super learning platform | This is amazing. I'm glad it didn't make me bag for my life in Japanese :3 | love itttttt | like it's nice but there are certain things that do not help in learning the language | Favors ai, and no longer cares about their community. | it's not bad but it doesn't help you speak Spanish to be honest | Good stuff.

I'm learning Korean. then I'll learn Russian | Today something happened that made me disappointed with Duolingo after many similar incidents. All of a sudden, the lessons changed from unit 5 and became unit 2. God knows what happened to the previous three units, but the important thing is that the possibility of reviewing them was also lost. It used to happen with lessons on the updates before. but now it regress automatically as scale of units!!! I have no motivation to continue with duolingo anymore👎🏻i warn this before.

Nova verze ale uz neumi PiP mod (uplne to zmizelo z nastaveni), takze zase nepouzitelne. | It baffles me that app that has obvisouvly worse user experience was released to replace the old. I understand that there might be reasons to replace the app but no with this... Oh and the pip (picture in picture 🤦) isn't working. | Problémy se startem aplikace a načtení dat. Hrůza, po uplynutí subscription s O2tv končím. Za ty peníze to opravdu nestojí. | Občas jde, občas nejde. A když zrovna jde, tak hrozne pomalu.. | Can't change video quality on android phone. | Jak můžete něco takového pustit do produkce? | Loading for ages, quality is awful (( | Pomalá, často ani ne naběhne. Nepřehledná, nelze nastavit list programu. Nevidím žádné zlepšení, naopak. | Impossible installation on the Android TV box and the lack of chromecast basically means the impossibility of using the service ... if these two things that worked great with old app don't appear soon, I'm ending the service. | This app must be a joke. Terrible and really slow. Just uninstalled. | App is not opening at all... absolutely the worste app ever! | Terrible app, does not work on a Chromecast. Loss of functionality, it is more difficult to record shows. It has lags. What a downgrade! | Ot2 tv nejde spusti, po instalaci nelze se prihlasit . | Aplikace nefunguje. Zatím se mi ani jednou ještě nespustila. Stará aplikace fungovala bez problémů, teď již také nelze používat. Tudíž je nemožné sledovat přenosy na mobilním zařízení. | Videa se trhají, nepoužitelné. Chci zpátky původní aplikaci, jinak končím. | Priserny!!! Melo vy se to jmenicat o2 tv -1 , protoze je to downgrade...Nejde prehravat v okne shozena , jde sledovat jen v jedne poloze. Fakt jako jak tohle mize nekdo povazovat za vylepsenou verzi :D. A to , ze to neustale pada a nebo nekonecne dlouho nacita uz nikoho u produktu od O2 ani neprekvapi. | Nejhorší appka, co se mi dostala pod ruku. | Hodně špatná a nepovedená aktualizace. Program se nenačítá, vždy se musím vrátit na úvodní stranu o2tv. I na televizi to je hrůza- všechny ty vychytávky, které usnadňovaly hledání pořadu, psaní textů apod., teď nejdou nebo je to děsně složité. Písmo je malé, že na to skoro nevidím. Na TV, která se koupila 2017 tato aktualizace nefunguje. Atd. Doufám, že rychle přijdou s o2tv 3.0, protože tohle se opravdu vůbec nepovedlo. | Velice spatna aplikace, stabilitou, odezvou, narocnosti na HW, na nekterych tab nesedi menu a ikony. Puvodni co fungovala 2 dny zpet byla bez chyb. Zkouseno na 2 TV a 2 tab a telefonu. Tato je bohuzel ODPAD! Uvazuji o zruseni cele sluzby O2TV, pokud nekdo neudela stabilni release v blizke dobe... | Takže pokud to chápu správně když mám smart LG TV web os 3.9 2017 a je třeba web os 4.0 2018 tak mám smůlu a musím si dokoupit O2 box za 4k? Asi ušetřím na předplatném... | oproti starší verzi extra pomalé | Such a step back from previous app, picture in picture not supported, no portrait mode for playback... For me absolutely unusable for these reasons | Velmi zklamán že byla odebrána možnost obrazu v rohu při používání jiných aplikací ( obraz v obraze ) ... Zatím velké zklamání ...čekal jsem mnohem víc od updatu.... :/ | one step back | Naprosto nepochopitelné a bohužél opakované selhání. Jen tak dál. Zákazník na poslením místě. Tleskám managementu O2. | Nedá se přihlásit, mám správné přihlašovací údaje, ale hlásí to chybu. Přihlášení přes aplikaci nefunguje. Za toto by se nemělo platit. | Dobrý den, jak na chytrém telefonu, tak i na televizi TCL se mi nedaří přihlásit z důvodu chybných přihlašovacích údajů. V internetovém prohlížeči, či ve staré aplikacii přihlášení funguje. Je něco špatně u mě? | Proč proboha zrušili vlastní výběr a řazení kanálů v téhle ""nové"" verzi? Kdo vymyslel ten zoufalý pokus s Oblíbenými kanály a k čemu mi je v menu Sport a Dětské, které nesleduji, proč to nejde odebrat? Naprosté zoufalství, platíme Vám měsíčně prachy na provoz, udělejte s tím něco !!!! | Skvělá meditační aplikace, obzvlášť pokud vás uklidňuje pohled na točící se kolečko. Jen na tu televizi se moc nepodíváte. Update: Problém nastane vždy, pokud aplikaci instalujete z o2tv 1 a následně ji (při příštím zapnutí zařízení) z o2tv 1 i zapnete. V tu chvili se o2tv 2 už nezapne. Nepomůže restart ani ukončení. Musíte o2tv 1 odinstalovat a vymazat data o2tv 2. Pak to naskočí a funguje správně. Stejné chování na android telefonu, Panasonic televizi a i na vašem starším android TV boxu. | Nepodporuje Xbox (nelze nainstalovat, ani nelze spustit z prohlížeče uvnitř), nepodporuje odesílání na Chromecast. Čumím do mobilu, neboť kupovat kvůli české lize (jiné kanály mám u jiného operátora) další televizi ani o2 set-top box nechci. Velké zklamání z 0 podpory... Dojedu (asi omylem) koupený předplatný a končím. Vraťte o2tv verze 1. Vidím, že podporu Chromecast slibují od min. 8.8.2023... Tak furt nic, intenzivní práce na podpoře nejspíše pokračuje. | Všechno je špatně. Kdo to sakra vyvíjí? Neumí ani pracovat s chybovými hláškami, na všechny problémy při přihlášení zobrazují, že je špatné heslo nebo email, to je extrém toto. Možná to dejte konečně nějaké firmě, místo toho, aby to psali děti na základní škole v rámci výuky o špatném softwaru. | The worst app I've downloaded in a while. Huge step back from the original. At this moment it's much better for Czech sports fans to just pay for SkySports or Paramount+ which come at the same price and with much more reliable platforms and content. Stay away from O2. They only have so many subscribers because they own the market in Czech republic. Their service is disastrous | 02/2024 - Možná se trochu zlepšila trhanost pohybu v EPG. Stále je to nedodělek (jak je vůbec možné hromadně převádět lidi na tuto novou verzi, která ztratila některé (veškeré dobré) vlastnosti předchozí verze, a to už bude tato 2.0 aplikace možná rok od uvedení) - chybí podpora Chromecast - v EPG přehledu nelze kliknout na jméno kanálu a tam si vybrat pořad, nelze ""vyskočit"" z aplikace a mít obraz v malém okně. | Aplikace se ani nenačte | Původní aplikace byla ve všech ohledech lepší. Např. rychlejší, bylo možné nastavit kvalitu, přehlednější, není možné si vytvořit vlastní seznam stanic, při scrollování v programu se aplikace seká a chová skoro jak chce. | Unusable, unresponsive, crashing all the time a real shame and thr worst is that this has been like this without any improvements for monthsa dm getting worse with every update | Doesn't work at all | Still bad | nufunguje zde nic | Opravdu velmi nepovedena aplikace. Ani se neda prihlasit. Neustale hlasi, ze mam spatne heslo a nabizi jeho obnovu. Na puvodni aplikaci heslo pritom funguje. | Kdy bude aplikace podporovat Chromecast with Google TV HD? Proč v seznamu programů nelze vyfiltrovat oblíbené? Proč je 2.0 aplikace horší než ta původní? A proč je pomalejší? Viděli jste někdy appku Netflixu? Ta je proti vaší aplikaci jak z jiné galaxie... | Way worse then 1.0 | Poooor | Tohle je příklad toho jak se aplikace nemá dělat. Neskutečně se seká i na rychlém mobilu. | Application is quite good. But why is not able to scroll programs forward? | Už přihlašování do aplikace je hrozné. Proč se nemůžu přihlásit pomocí aplikace v telefonu nebo aspoň využívat nativní klávesnici? | Hrozna aplikace, a vubec nejhorsi mi pripada, ze z venku to vypada jak kdyby na appce pracoval jeden vyvojar na pul uvazku, protoze pri mnozstvi bugu, o kterych O2 musi vedet, bych ocekaval release kazdy tyden/dva a ne ze posledni release byl pred dvema mesici. Nekdo v O2 se proste totalne zblaznil a ja nechapu, jak tohle muze seniorni vedeni tak dlouho trpet. | To jako vážně nemáte verzi pro Chromecast 4? | EDIT: Vaše odpověď: „Dobrý den, Chromecast v současné době nepatří mezi podporovaná zařízení pro sledováni 02 TV. Důvodem je nedostatečná podpora ze strany výrobců televizorů.“ O jaké nedostatečné podpoře je proboha řeč? Chromecast podporuje každá (i hloupá) televize, která má HDMI vstup. Tohle byste mohli trochu rozvést. Každopádně když jsem si stáhl apk balíček O2 TV pro Android TV a nainstaloval ho na Chromecast, fungovalo to dobře. | Nepodporuje casting do televize, prohlížení EPG je neskutečně pomalé, není možné rychle přepínat titulky/zvuk při přehrávání (možné pouze hluboko v menu aplikace), nemá režim na šířku při procházení menu. Opravdu velmi nepovedená aplikace, bohužel. | Je to pomalejší, než dříve, neintuitivní a teď se navíc stále zapínají titulky i když je vypneme a podrobnosti o zvoleném kanále asi překrývají kus obrazovky, protože nelze zobrazit kanál s menším číslem, než 11. | Otřes. Pomalá, nejde nastavit kvalitu streamu, takže je video rozmazané. ... Já potřebuju ZVÝŠIT rozlišení videa, OMG! | Naprosto strašné a pomalé ovládání. Na setop boxu nefunguje dálkový ovladač. Tlačítka pro rychlou volbu funkci nefungují. Při konci časového slotu pro daný pořad se objeví kolečko beznaděje a po 5 až 10 sekundách pořád pokračuje. Úplně pomale. Proti verzi 1 horší ovládání a to i v apce na mobilu. Vraťte to zpět prosiiiiiim. A nakonec dostanete odpověď podobnou co jsem dostal na prodejně. Když ten kabel není metr podzemí tak kopejte tak do 5 až 6 metrů tam určitě bude :) | Předchozí verze na TV Philips fungovala bez problémů. O2 TV 2.0 se při každém prvním spuštění načítá tak dlouho (někdy i při načítání zamrzne) , že je to daleko za hranicí použitelnosti. Škoda, že nejdou dávat hvězdičky do mínusu. Otřesný zážitek. | Bylo by dobrÿ,kdyby jste implementovali funkci zvětšení obrazu,jak bylo u předchozí verze | Doesn't work on other devices, nightmare!!! | Predchozi verze fungovala. Bohuzel se to o teto verzi rici neda :-(. Na mem TV boxu (Android) naprosto nepouzitelne :-( Pokud se tato situace v kratke dobe nezlepsi, budu nucen odejit k jinemu poskytovateli. | Velmi spatna aplikace, zmena k horsimu proti predchozi verzi. Napr. navigace v programu, pohyb ui neni synchronni s gesty - posunem prstem, je zrychlovan. Nebo, u nahravek se nova verze se snazi o seskupovani poradu v serii, ale dostanete se k tomu poslenimu, coz je super, musite se divat pozpatku, nebo zmizelo tlacitko pro primy pristup z nahravkam, misto toho je tam 'Sport', ale na kazdy se chce divat jak jini cvici. Proste to O2 pekne odflaklo, myslim, ze konkurenti maji lepsi appku. | Seká se, padá, nejde zobrazit jeden program na svislé stránce, nestíhají se načítat názvy programů (na samsung galaxy tab 7)... jednoznačná změna k horšímu ve srovnání s předchozí verzí | Zpackaná hrůza! | Strašný Edit: stále strašný. Doufám, že o2 ztratí vysílací práva na ligu mistrů, abych se toho mohl konečně zbavit. | Server errors all the time. Poor UX | Ani nevim, jestli dat vubec 1 hvezdu. Nevim, kdo tohle vymyslel, ale musel byt pravdepodobne v nejakem straslivem stavu. Neda popsat sada vsech tuposti - od abslutne neintuitivniho ovladani, pres katastrofalni pomalost odezvy az nemoznost vytvorit vlastni seznam programu. Pri EPG nejde zvuk. K tomu, aby se clovek dostal k menu aplikace potrebuje navod. Vratte tu puvodni a fakt nedelejte ""vylepseni"", ktere je jednim slovem hruza. Testery jste asi nezapojili. Tohle by s nimi snad nemohlo projit. | Nepouzitelne.. Krok zpatky oproti stare appce. Pomala, neumi hrat pri praci s jinou app v malem okne, osobni seznam programu zmizel a novy nejde vytvorit, musim chodit pres program vsech kanalu, coz je silene, posouvani na casove ose ve videu takrka nefunguje,... Vynutili jste prechod na novou app, ale je to smejd, vratte starou app, nebo penize za sluzbu o2tv! Edit: na samsung tv 2017 nova app vubec nefunguje, stara fungovala i na 2016 modelech.. Zvazuji konkurenci a nejsem sam.. | Původní aplikace O2 TV fungovala bezvadně, o této se to bohužel říct nedá. Aplikace se seká a teď se přidala další super věc - zhruba po 15 minutách sledování aplikace napíše chyba spojení a pak se celá zrestartuje. Po tomto restartu se vždy spustí o 180 stupňů jinak než je orientace obrazovky. Je jedno jestli jsem na datech nebo wifi, v obou případech se to děje. | Wou O2 seems to want lost customers paying for services as it would be with TV (virtually free) and whole the time its not working or they are doing best to prevent me from watching it! This APP is laggy + cant be streamed into chrome cast. Ultimated combo is with Prima others providers will allow you to look eq from half of movie etc (only comercials are blocked), but not O2. So you can watch to an movie then theirs internet will be dropped and you can start watching it from start only. Bravo | Nemožný najít změnu kvality obrazu | O2TV nepodporuje ChromeCast 4... Vodafone, T-Mobile, VOYO, NEJTV, TElly, KoDi, KUKI, PODA to zvládli, ale O2 stále nic a ještě k tomu zablokovala aplikaci O2TV instalovnou z apk. Děkujeme... Kdy se dočkáme? | Nefunguje Chromecast!!! | Buggy, resources way to hungry... stopped using it. | Previous ""obsolete"" version was way better. When I cast (mirror) my screen to chromecast, it transfers only sound, picture is not transferred. This was working correctly in old app. Seems that war against chromecast escalates. Flipping through the program is jerky and it takes time to load and overall is very unpleasant. Cannot list through programs when phone is sideways. Overall this update kills nearly all usage of o2tv for me. I am very disappointed. | Po čekání na postupně uvolnění pro televize TCL jsem čekal vyladěný produkt a dočkal se nejhorší VOD aplikace ze všech. Fakt jsem zkusil od Netflixu po Sky a žádná není tak hrozná jako tohle. Na všechno čekám, tlačítka reagují s hroznům zpožděním, pokud TV vypnu bez ukončení aplikace, po startu je šílené dlouho nepoužitelná. Pravidelně musím aplikaci zabít, někdy hraje i na pozadí. Aplikace ČT je ve srovnání dokonalá. Promarněná příležitost u skvělého produktu, smutné. | totální trash app, žere výkon, neintuitivní design... všechno špatně | Díky bohu, že jsem instalaci nové verze zakázal. Jak může obří firma, jako O2, vypustit takový brutální paskvil, je pro mě nepochopitelné. Obzvláště, když první verze byla relativně slušná... | Líná TV aplikace. Nelze použít tlačítka na zastavení, spuštění, ani pauzy přehrávání na ovladači. Musím stisknout dvě tlačítka, dolů a OK, abych mohl zapauzovat či spustit film. Přetáčení dopředu/dozadu je peklo. Je velice snadné přeskočit o 40 minut, i když chci jen o 5 minut. Nové UI má méně funkcí a je komplikované, změňte ho. Nutit zákazníky přejít na horší aplikaci je arogance. Teď to nefunguje a je zpět stará aplikace. Doufám, že hlavoun, co to protlačil, přijde minimálně o prémie. | Katastrofa, nechápu, že si někdo v dnešní době dovolí pustit ven takovou aplikaci a ještě si nechá za ""TV"" platit tolik, kolik O2. | Why can't the O2 app be installed on Chromecast 4? Can you fix that? When can we expect it will be done? | pomalé a nestabilní | Ještě horší appka než ta předchozí. Ovládání na TV je úplně k ničemu. Často hlásí poruchu nebo problémy s připojením i když internet funguje. Tak používám jiného providera. | Aplikace je oproti předchozí pomalá. Vše se dlouho načítá, vypadává, během přehrávání běžného pořadu mi to několikrát skočilo do menu bez přičinění, menu je nepřehledné. Přes celou obrazovku jede obraz toho, co dávají, což není vůbec potřeba a zároveň to všechny položky odsune níž. Aplikace jsou nesmyslně seřazeny vedle sebe a ne pod sebe, takže když chci tu poslední, musím se tam proklikat. Na mobilu se mi TV seká. Po každé cca půl minutě zamrzne obraz na sekundu. Pořad jde špatně přetáčet. :( | To si snad děláte pr... ne? Tohle je nejhorší app jakou jsem za poslední roky viděl. Kdo to optimalizoval? Nějací učni na kalkulačkách? .. Oproti staré aplikaci zalagované, nepoužitelné, nepřehledné... Tohle Vám trvalo takovou dobu? Kde jsou základní funkce jako třeba podpora Chromecast? Velký fail | Without Chromecast support it's just a useless app. Definitely going to consider another provider, as O2 can't give us something useful. | V appce nelze nastavit rozlišení a tím pádem kvalita obrazu. Po spuštění jiné appky nezůstává miniaturní okno s přenosem pro rychlý návrat zpátky ke sledování, ba se dokonce přenos přeruší, člověk přijde i o audio | Aplikace se dlouho načítá a v průběhu se pořád zasekává, i když mám rychlé a stabilní připojení k internetu. | Neskutečně špatná aplikace. Evidentně je to pouze WebView webové verze, takže optimalizace neexistuje. Načítá se dlouho. Program se nedá používat. Kdybyste aspoň nechali přístupnou starou verzi. Ta se aspoň dala používat. Kdyby tu jen byla nějaká možnost 3. stran. Lidi by byli schopní udělat mnohem lepší aplikace. Škoda. | Verze 2.0 je děsně pomalá. Špatně reaguje při posouvání v tel programu, vždycky sebou škubne tak, že si musím ověřit ve které části dne se to octlo. Je neintuitivni. Kam zmizely nahrávky. Sport mě nezajímá. Schází sdílení na Chromecast, které je pro naši rodinu stěžejní. Čas změnit internetového poskytovatele? Dejte lidem na výběr, kterou verzi používat. | Aplikace je vyrazne pomalejsi nez predchozi a nyni jiz nezobrazi obsah vubec .... programatori nejspis nejsou i uzivatele teto aplikace a pak to takto vypada. | Tato nova app 2.0 má zásadní nedostatky (v porovnaní s původní verzí): 1. Velice velice pomala (jak na mobilních datech tak i hlavně na wifi) 2. Neda se nastavit rychlost/kvalita videa/streamu v app na telefonu (v původní verzi bylo min. 5 možností). Možnost SD/HD/auto je možná pouze na PC verzi (kterou velká většina sleduje stejně na wifi, kde je standartně dostatek dat pro 'HD as default') 3. App na telefonu nefunguje na pozadí (což předchodí verze umožňovala). Vše nutno zásadně vylepšit asap | Neuvěřitelně neresponzivní, vše trvá strašně dlouho. Po přepnutí jinam se po pár vteřinách ozve zvuk přehrávaného pořadu. | Chyba přehrávaču | Stále nejde používat s chromecast, naprosto základní věc..... | Nemuzu stahnout na projektoru s android tv 12. Nejde stahnout na playsta. Z mobilu streamovat nejde. Sežente si pořádný vývojáře konečně. | Nepodporovaný ani Xiaomi stick. | Prosím, hlavne neodstraňuje starú verziu. Nová verzia je pomalá, chýba história v náhradných programoch. Nedá sa prehrávať Prima kanál, keď ešte beží a pod. Každopádne ďakujem, že sa snažíte aplikáciu vylepšovať. | toto review bylo napsano pomoci externi klavesnice. Jelikoz neni jak a komu napsat zpetnou vazby a O2 support konstatuje, ze odmita o problemech komunikovat, tak tedy maji zakaznici smulu. But to prosim delejte poradne nebo radeji vubec. Google ma samozrejme take rezervy ale v tomto pripade je to vec pouze O2 TV. Jinak bych toto nebyl schopen napsat na klavesnici. | Priserny. Neda se nastavit kvalita obrazu a ikdyz jsem na 100mb wifi, porady mi bezi na nejhorsi kvalitu, puvodni aplikace taky nebyla zadny slagr, ale tahle je uplne priserna..... | I can no longer cast to Chromecast with this new version. | Naprostá zoufalost. Vůbec nefunguje. Nejhorší je, že původní aplikace která vypadá že jede svižně a vždycky fungovala bez problémů, tak mi nedovolí pouštět obsah a odkazuje mě na tuto novou verzi. Nová mi ale vůbec nenajizdi, několik minut se točí a točí a točí... A nic. Za tohle platím? Abych koukal minuty na tocici se kolečko az mi dojdou nervy a radši to vypnu. | The worst app ever, I believe you already know that the reason. In the first place its not user friendly and 2nd hand I downloaded it on my Samsung TV but its completely worthless (lags and too slow) and already contacted your IT team he knew nothing about it. Put all these problems aside I ordered this package online, so why the heck can't cancel my subscription online?? Why I should come to you to cancel it?? I just don't get it!!!!! | Dobry den, hodlate vratit do aplikace funkci chromecast? | Tak pomalé,ze aplikaci v podstatě neni možné ovládat. | Co jste to vydali za .....? Nacita se to pomaleji nez starsi verze. Kdyz uz nabehne, UI je desive pomale. Ficury ktere fungovali na starsi nefunguji ted, jako napr. prehravani na pozadi. Fullscreen mod funguje blbe a stale je videt lista. A kvalita prehravani take skace, coz musi byt chyba v aplikaci, ne siti, protoze sit je stabilni Gb a schvalne si vedle pustil potom 4k stream a v klidku. OS stejna verze, pripojen jsem pred Gb wifi. Fakt tuhle stahnete z marketu a nechejte starsi verzi. | Nevím co dvojka přinesla dobrého, ale ztráta filtru programů je pro mne velmi bolestná.","{""1"":6355,""2"":305,""3"":180,""4"":94,""5"":314}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","O2 Czech Republic a.s.","O2+Czech+Republic+a.s.","aplikace@o2guru.cz","https://www.o2.cz","O2 Czech Republic a.s.

"Threads, an Instagram app","Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Open social networking – coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

The app functions well, however I've not been able to get engaged with the app. I think it's part of the problem with Facebook/meta owned apps. They either ruin existing apps (Instagram) or they just copy another app but don't make it that appealing. | Superb 👍 | Valo | Very bad | El secso le gana | App has not opened for weeks now. | kashimkhan | Bogus | osm | I like Threads except when they mess with the algorithms. I never, ever entertain MAGAts, & when they appear on my TL, I immediately block them for their augmented reality, lies, & general scumdum. | needs design improvement, assets position improvement | Nice | Raj Sharma 217 | nice pic | 👺 | FAIR AND HONEST !!!! | Hate getting notifications on Instagram from Threads. Have turned all notifications off and I still get them. I have absolutely no interest in anything Threads has to offer | Md sahid | nice | A bit stupid says I have a follow requests.

WORST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. Just another tool of the West to manipulate the whole world 🫶🏻 Doesn't respond to bot accounts that's spreading false information or posts content related to pedophilia. | This is very useful app | Nice . | Very unreliable. Isn't easy to open and when it works it isn't easy to operate. | So nice | Very annoying when things are constantly popping up & you can't items you are actually interested in!! | most superfull app | Apps under Meta are simply shitholes. Never delete any racist, sexist or terrorist contents but deleting contents exposing ponzi scams. | The recent update removed the following tab from the home page.

Tapping the icon at the top lets you view your \""following\"" feed and you can use multiple accounts. The bug with video playback not having sound sometimes is still an issue for me. Reading other reviews, I agree that a direct messaging system independent of Insta would make this even better. It's become a great alternative to X (formerly Twitter), just needs some things ironed out. Added 1 star."",""This was a great app for finding random people and shouting into the void. But it's got problems and they don't seem to get fixed. Videos that freeze when unmuting, weird darkening of the screen (shows up in screenshots), aggressively scrolling to the top if you switch away or turn off the screen for a second, and now the following feed is gone. It's becoming a chore to keep using the app."",""The app is infuriating, it keeps losing the message I am trying to read by updating and jumping to the top for no real reason! I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline."",""It needs some improvements. It's gotten a little better in the past few weeks. There are still some kinks, and it's lacking some features that should be obvious. My biggest issue with the app is that some videos will have no sound. When you click the sound icon to turn on the sound, the video freezes and won't play. So you can either watch it with no sound or move on. Opening the full video doesn't help. Following their channel won't help. Nothing works! It's only on some videos. Seems random."",""Used to work. Now it doesn't. I got a new phone. Installed all the same software. Logged into all the same accounts. Now when I open Threads, it asked if I want to log in with my Instagram account. I confirm it. Then it says get ready for Threads. And then crashes. Every. Single. Time. Yes I cleared my cache. Yes I cleared the storage. Yes I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Yes I rebooted my phone.

Člověk má nárok na slevu a nefunguje to! Billa aplikace = podvod | Totalni amaterina, jak se ma clovek zaregistrovat, kdyz ani ten email neprijde.. | Nenačítají se žádné obrázky a sekce s letáky je prázdná. | Naprosto neintuitivní používání aplikace, každý kupón je nutno skenovat extra, ztráta času a podpora tvoření front v obchodech. | Super aplikace, při registraci to opakovaně vyhazuje chybu, po třech hovorech na infolince stále nevyřešeno a teď už se ani nejde divolat na infolinku, takže asi nejsem jediný, komu se to s@r@ | Aplikace naprosto k ničemu, registrace s kartou nefunguje, ale co je nejhorší, že ani nová registrace bez karty nefunguje. | Akward to use coupons. It seems you have to scan each one individually instead of just attaching it to the entire purchase | Nemá tmavý režim. Nemá Google SSO. Starší recenze: Několikrát za rok mě aplikace sama od sebe odhlásí, a já si pak musím resetovat heslo, protože si ho nepamatuju. Buď to odhlašování opravte, nebo přidejte možnost přihlášením před Google SSO. | Does not work correctly thiw app. | Registrace do bonus club nefunguje, pokouším se o to cas od casu už minimálně rok, směšné (nefunguje ani na webu) | Your card will not download and open on my phone | After the last update the app doesn't open any leaflet. You can open them on the web but not in the app. | Doesn't let you sign in to your account | The application looks nice and mostly functions well. However, it tends to sign you off your account just after a couple of weeks of inactivity. It's very frustrating to come to a store and Please sign on instead of your card at the check out. | Extrémně špatná aplikace. Odhlašuje mě. Field pro heslo se nechová jako heslo. | There were online registration problem on the app but it is solved with e-mail support. | Při každém spuštění se zobrazuje výzva k zapnutí přístupu k poloze kvůli mapě prodejen. Tato funkce mne nezajímá, chci aplikaci pouze jako náhradu za plastovou kartu. Spouštění je tedy otravné. | Has little use. | Can't change app language to English.. not useful for foreigners | No English and it is not a shopping app | Takes 1000 problems till you use it | Aktivační kód je neplatný...Nejhorší registrace jakou sem za posledních několik let viděl. A ani po 3 dnech nebyla dokončena kvůli neplatnému kódu. Samotné poslání onoho kódu trvá několik hodina stejně jako případný link na reset hesla. | App with No english support | Nelze dokoncit registraci. Nelze online kartu. Letaky v aplikaci ani nemluvim. K nicemu. Nejhorsi cz supermarket app. Zoufalstvi. Diky bohu, ze je konkurence velika a Billu clovek muze na nakupy naprosto vynechat. | To šoupani je hrozny | Za neodečet bodů z kartičky za bonusové dětské hračky. Platí ve akci jenom papírové body. | Pozadavek na zmenu hesla zaslan opakovane, a nic se nedeje, ani spam nic nehlasi. To je potreba opravit. Polozky z letaku si nemuzu vlozit do nakupniho seznamu, to by apku posunulo dal. Pri hledani prodejny aplikace prestala pracovat, ale to se mi stalo u druhy konkurencni appky taky, takze nechavam 3 z 5. | Přihlašování stojí za prd. Zrovna jsem šel na pokladnu a aplikace mě odhlásila. Od té doby se nemůžu přihlásit, takže prostě furt musím používat obrázek svého kartového kódu z webové stránky, kvůli čemu tahle aplikace stejně ztratí účel. Prostě se zaregistrujete na stránkách a používejte obrázek svého čárového kódu. Pořád to funguje lépe, než tahle aplikace. | Registrace nefunguje. | Nejlepsi! | Only flyer and direction to near shop Unpossible search and buy goods | Not that good | It shuts down every time I open it. | odpad | Total sh**t! | Vzhledem k tomu, že jsem stihla uklidit byt a za tu dobu se leták stále nenačetl, tak máte 1 hvězdičku za vzhled. Jinak nepoužitelná. | Malé písmo v letácích nečitelné. Raději budu používat aplikaci Moje letáky. Nazdar! | Nepoužitelné | Zoufalství. Krkolomné ovládání. Letáky v nepoužitelně nízkém rozlišení. | BMI bych oželela, akční leták by se měl načítat rychleji (a tím nemyslím do sekundy, do minuty by v tuto chvíli stačilo) a trochu jsem očekávala seznam alespoň BILLA výrobků se všemi potřebnými údaji. | Odinstalovani a opetovne nainstalovani nepomohlo.","{""1"":963,""2"":62,""3"":83,""4"":83,""5"":418}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","BILLA AG","7080944624725586372","info@billa.cz","http://www.billa.cz","Billa Aktiengesellschaft

Za těch několik měsíců by to už mohli opravit... | Z mobil. bankovnictvi, se kterymi jsem přišel do styku, mi tahle přijde nejprehlednejsi, jednoduché přehledne UI, cením, že na stránce přehledu nejsou zbytečne informace, různá doporučení, nabídky produktu... Je zde v podstatě jen 1 typ menu, což působí velmi přehledně(ne všechny banky to takto maji). Jediné co bych osobně ocenil, je zjednodušit přístup nastavení. Nepřijde mi příliš intuitivní aktuální přístup. Za mě bych klidně to ozubené kolečko reprezentující nastavení nechal v pravo nahore. | Zabugované jak prase. | Jednoduše nefunguje:))) Předchozí aplikace fungovala bez problému. Zajímal by mě důvod téhle ""nové éry"". Hrůza. | klasicka spatna KB, aplikace se instaluje a kdyz prerusite, musite jet znovu⛔ puvodni ucet se nenacte, tak KB znovu a lépe ‼️❌ | Aplikace mě nutí změnit banku... | Předchozí aplikace byla výrazně lepší.... Upozornění ke KB klíči mi nechodí vůbec, musím vždy v aplikaci najít záložku KB klíč a až potom potvrdit. Upozornění o zaplacení mi přijde až 30 minut potom co jsem kartou zaplatila... Kdyby někdo zneužil mou kartu, dozvím se to nejspíš až za hodinu. Za největší mínus ale považuji to, že si nelze zobrazit platby, které již proběhly, ale jsou stále blokované. Na účtu už mám tedy nižší zůstatek, ale nevidím, kam peníze zmizeli. | S aplikací jsou neustále problémy. Někdy prostě nemůžu aplikaci otevřít, teď zase ""nemám dostatečnou autorizaci"" abych někam poslal peníze?? V kritických situacích mi KB+ zakazuje přístup k financím, nebo nedovoluje si přetáhnout peníže ze spořícího. Jen díky tomu mám intenzivní frustraci z KB a pokud se něco mezmění, budu měnit banku. -------EDIT: Budu sem připisovat každý moment, kdy nemám přístup k penězům: => 5.3. - We're experiencing network issues! Check your internet connection! | Chci zobrazit detail uctu...nic, chci provest novou platbu...vyskoci okno ""zkuste to znovu"" pulka funkci nefunguje | Not all outgoing payments (manually input or from templates) are displayed on the account overview. Not even after couple of days. Even though the pop up confirms payment was successful. Can't keep track of the payments which is ridiculous and makes my life complicated | Nesnáším tuto aplikaci z plného srdce. Často nefunguje a pomůže jen restart zařízení. Často se zasekne při načítání před přihlášení, po přihlášení nebo při potvrzení požadavku. To pak znamená odstřihnutí od vlastního účtu... Když už náhodou funguje, tak stejně nic neumí, možná až na zobrazení zůstatku. ""Zabere vám to 5 minut"" To byla lež! ""Věříme, že aplikaci dáte šanci"" Ano, šanci jste dostali. Je čas odejít od KB. | A smart banking app that still doesn't let you see your card details (in 2024) is just useless | Jednodušší interface výměnou za nižší bezpečnost (místo hesla pin)? | The change mgmt of this migration is highly mismanaged. Will close down my account, my money wrongly spent on the rocky launch of this new environment. | Chaos, strasnej chaos, kdybych vedela, jak to bude vypadat, tak ten ucet zrusim. Neprehledne, nevidim kde se daji odesilat platby ani jakykoliv funkce, ktere byly v starsi aplikaci, hruza a des. Banky se snazi udelat bankovnictvi co nejvice jednoduche, aby to zvladl kazdy, jsem dite dnesni doby a stejne se v tom nevyznam. Odejdu hned, jak to bude mozne. | Horrible horrible app. Where is the option to issue a claim? Did they just remove that? Great. | aplikace postrádá mnoho předchozích funkci i Widgetu a je velmi nepřehledná, nerozumím k čemu je ten přechod na novou aplikace užitečný, asi jen kvůli změně u nových klientů se sazebníkem. | Pár maličkostí, které by potřebovaly změnu: nelze si změnit vzhled již stávající karty, nelze si v aplikaci sjednat kartu jinou než debetní (ani zlatá ani kreditní nejde), nelze si nastavit heslo jiné než 6 místný PIN, jazyk aplikace je stejný jako jazyk zařízení | Pri dnesni aktualizaci 18.1. Mi aplikace prestala fungovat. Proc? | Nefunguje radne. Nevidime kompletni seznam svych produktu a nefunguji screanshoty.Stiznosti do KB odeslany. Odpoved,ze jsme neprevedli radne,je licha. Nefunguji screanshoty,moznost pdf castecnych vypisu. Tuhle aplikace nechci.Neprehledna,chci zpet puvodni. | ""You don't have sufficient authorization"" správa ma sprevádza celou appkou i prechodom na ňu... Všeobecne by sa kb hodilo menej systémových zmien a radšej vylepšienie toho čo už je. Oproti iným bankovým appkám ktoré používam som musel v kb robiť najviac takýchto prechodov a appka je aj tak stále najhoršia... rozumiem, že budú časom inkrementálne robené zmeny, prečo je ale appka dostupná v tejto ""beta verzii"" už teraz? | ▪︎Hned po loginu chce hodnotit. Takže 1★. ▪︎Místo 6-16 číslic nebo 8-20 znaků je 6místný PIN. ▪︎MB skutečně potřebovala spálit a začít znova, její kód je rezavé klubko drátů. Ale urgovat mě hned si přijít pro NoVoU ÉrU bankéřka nemusela, stará appka ještě funguje. Vyřídil jsem si to doma a schůzku zrušil. Že to jde, pro ni byla novinka! ▪︎Vyhrazují si právo blokovat odemčený bootloader, čímž nutí klienty víc důvěřovat výrobci mobilu než sobě. ▪︎Nemají RaiPay. NFC jde přes Google, který vše vidí. | Registrace pres bankovni identitu nefunguje :/ | Nejvíc mě asi štve, že nejde změnit (respektive zvolit si) jazyk aplikace, zrovna bankovnictví se mi nechce používat v angličtině. Jinak jsem jí zatim moc nevyzkoušel, tak uvidíme. | Nejde přepnout jazyk než na jiný co má telefon (je tam volba v menu, ale nic nedělá) Aplikace má časté problémy kdy nejde platit, klikněte na položku a ""something went wrong"" a dal nereaguje | Worst app ever. Previous app was hell. They forced me clicking on some random stuff related to ""conversion to new banking"". Everything is same but you need to use this broken app. Just use different bank!! Avoid this hell. | Že by třeba v popisu aplikace bylo uvedeno, že je třeba počkat na pozvánku pro přechod? Nebo na to alespoň aplikace upozornila po stažení. Vše je stejně zkostnatělé jako celá KB. | Prosím přidat možnost přepnout jazyk. K čemu to je v menu, když to pak jen vyskočí hláška že je nastaveno podle telefonu. Vždy je dobré dát volbu uživateli. | Spoustu chyb při přechodu na nový typ účtu (podařilo se na pátý pokus, jinak chyby v průvodci typu internal server error), chybí zatím možnost pojištění přes aplikaci a stará aplikace už nefunguje. Porodní bolesti typu chyby při načtení stavu účtů. Something went při pokusu a platbu převodem přes QR kód pokud na chvíli dám aplikaci na pozadí 🙄 | They ""blocked my device"" with no explanation whatsoever. The only info you can see is ""call us at this number"". No one is at said number. Not even gonna start about the other stuff, like no info, it looking and running terribly. Horrible, feels like a low-key scam. | Nechápu, proč bylo potřeba přejít na novou aplikaci, stará fungovala dobře a dalo se na ni spolehnout. Nic z toho neplatí pro novou aplikaci, do které se většinu času ani nemůžu dostat. Proč, když už dělám novou aplikaci a mám k dispozici starou funkční, neudělám tu novou nejprve stoprocentní než ji vypustím mezi lidi. Hrůza | Funguje dobře, dokud se nepoužije možnost ""mojeplatba"" na alze: to je pak "" do tohoto bankovnictví nemáte přístup"" | Z ničeho nic přestala fungovat | Neprozřetelně jsem na pobočce nahlásil změnu na kontaktní adresu a teď chce aplikace přijmout tyto změny a po schválení to nahlásí chybu, že se něco nepovedlo a že na chybě se pracuje a od rána žádná změna, zítra budu volat do KB co se děje, aplikace nepoužitelná. [UPDATE] asi nějaká race condition s migrací, která trvala déle, než se prezentovalo, tedy po 3 dnech to nakonec prošlo. Autentifikace je v aplikaci pekelně pomalá a při přechodu z jiné aplikace se už neprovádí, což není moc bezpečné. | Onboarding jsem zkousel 3x. Pokazde me aplikace vrati na uvodni obrazovku at vuberu jestli jsem novy ci stabajici klient. Nechapu proc mi proboha z banky volali at na tenhle odpad prejdu. Ne dik. | Tohle se neda oznacit za nic jineho nez peklo. Nova aplikace temer nic neumi, chybi napr. i zakladni prace se sablonami. Mobilni i webova appka jsou fakt totalne oklesteny a doporucuji vsem, kdo nepresli jeste ze starych sluzeb, at se to snazi co nejvice oddalit a nebo radeji prejit k jine bance. I samotny prevod sluzeb do KB+ byl tragicky. | Super, bylo by fajn přidat výpočet kolik peněz dostanu z úroků na spořícím účtu. | Otřesný design jak z roku 2010, neschopnost přizpůsobení vzhledu a rozvržení aplikace, pomalejší než předchozí verze a hlavně extrémní nepřehlednost. Silně zvažuji přechod ke konkurenci. | I don't even have energy to describe everything wrong with the app. Just choose a different bank if you have the option unlike me. If you want to know why I'm giving 1 star, just use the app for 5 minutes. You'll quickly understand. | Přechod k horšímu, to že u pohybů na účtu nově nevidím status transakce (Booked, Cancelled..) opravdu nepovažuji za optimalizaci UX. Chválím integraci klíče, ještě zvládnout navigaci po prokliku notifikace. Schovat tento modul pod druhé menu je taky poměrně nešťastná volba. Za mě povedená první fáze implementace. To proč očividně neodladenou verzi aplikace posílá KB do ostrého provozu mi nicméně zůstává záhadou. Edit: Absence funkčního zaznamenávání platební historie je skutečně poslední kapkou | nelze spustit, nenahraje se ani možnost zadání pinu | Proč nelze nastavit jazyk aplikace jiný, než má zařízení? | Chaotic. At frst it fails. Why new pin? Why new bank account? Everything in this process is completely doubtfull for current users. Do not use the application! Looks completely like phishing stuff. Edit: So lets wait till the morning. I have succesfully created a savings account and as a result I do have two ?why? profiles in the bank. One original, the other one just for savings. | Špatně se načítá. Musím 3x minimalizovat a maximalizovat aby se apka načetla a já se dostal na účet. | KB se tváří že inovuje, ale v jádru je to pořád ta stejná banka která po mě vymáhala jeden haléř jako úrok z přečerapného účtu. | Myslím, že 3* jsou zatím adekvátní, aplikace toho moc neumí a upřímně nechápu, proč je ta aplikace venku tak brzo, když na to business očividně nebyl připraven a musí se zakládat nový účet. Aplikace neumí moc, ale chválím krok vpřed v designu (UX) a snad se s ní bude dobře pracovat i v plné verzi, jen vás chraň ruka páně, pokud nebude umět i podnikatelské účty tak jak MB, tak by znamenalo přechod jinam :) Taky doufám, že umíte kategorie jak revolut nebo bývalá Equa, pokud ne byla by to škoda. | Useless! Steals your data, then fails. You have to give them both sides of your ID, your driving license, a scan of your face, agree that they can use it for 5 years. The verification then ""fails"" and the app tells you to set it up in person instead.","{""1"":486,""2"":74,""3"":74,""4"":130,""5"":335}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Komerční banka, a.s.","6452965982168751355","mobilnibanka@kb.cz","https://www.kb.cz/cs/nase-aplikace/kb-plus",,"https://www.kb.cz/cs/ochrana-osobnich-udaju","6452965982168751355","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WKzWEy68jiGlOxjAMWCDYqdXHaLY0SHXFG4iTa6m3_Zkermk9-FTYm1WE_bRNipsnA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eK75U2vKZjQ6K407xu9_qOKp5J-oThro2CuiNbufjt8eZtxuZoJ5U-5UQjRRzFtbEeQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/skt3Su7rDV1KFZzkN2NAQBb5Is5CaLWG64xlAsPHv4emJLYD5ABpBuRv7aHceSryuLc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qgiWFTlCF2xEaVDvtjwZtiwhOF5_YA5fer2531ck-VhVUOuDkC0Tsi3NI71MaZyZG-s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GgMOgBff0DAT7ol6ZpfXrLPhPT1N2yS2siBtlqzQfwE_zYePMwArvzDDLon6om4Q1w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2eb3vBsnQrRZeXDpuwOP4Oek3nGofsGh6QNNEGsNr701X0LtronUixPtKYAj2vkycw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MvJ0oMyhuyCkOY4ePlKY9dUbnt-k0Q-_6bobawsZAM0_SR4BOExTwaBKiUwAGt-D7Bc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oZDOVaun4NMfCN-Q-_EO-vLd2zExH5RbobIZkpwE8Epw8Nl67uRu9YHE9xkITJ4t5g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dKdC_tMffG9mtGKjA3bwLIzHfsAeVVx42xcYY0hPsCSMPHpQrCsjCS31hkFds8F27_Ic""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Mar 17, 2023",1711114335000,"1.4.3","Bug fixing","[""Not all outgoing payments (manually input or from templates) are displayed on the account overview.

I can't believe that reels, which is basically rebranded Instagram TV or whatever it was called, is still so glitchy. I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck.

The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with."",""I use this app primarily to post content for my clients but I have grown to love to create content. Cool video, cute meter's , reels and stickers on the stories. But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying.

However I'd recommend removing notifications from the app. I haven't got round to it yet (it's been a few months since I downloaded it) but without fail, I'll probably get atleast 7 notifications each day reminding me that the app exists on my phone and I should buy a particular item. | Very good | Great App, easy to use, fast delivery and affordable products. | The best online shopping everyone needs they sell exact things in advert or in the picture I love you shein you never disappoint ❤️🌹✌🏿, | good | To much ads even though i dont have the app | Fix your apps | good | I love this app it is so affordable some of the clothes are very good quality and I can buy over and over again | Literally so bad, the items are nice but the shipping and scamming in the prices is annoying! | I'm very satisfied user of shien products | It was okay I guess | Gjnlkjk . iin jag är på | Packages do not arrive on time like they say they will and they will not refund it money do not buy anything from the peole | 🥰🥰🥰🥰 | great | Best | Disturbing I don't want to see anymore | It's expensive as it's shipping | Good application | Good | Very Awesome and recommended!!

Probably our 10th order to date. Paid as usual via debit card & Shein asked us to send proof of successful transaction. WARNING a debit or credit card can't send proof other than bank statement. Only EFT has a pop. We placed the order a 2nd time thinking its her card. Shein cancelled both orders despite screenshots of the bank App. She is now 11k out of pocket awaiting refunds.

It's absolutely gorgeous and the prices are to die for! You won't get deals like this anywhere else! Plus the chance to win free stuff if you put the time in. You don't have to even spend a penny to get stuff from them! | My place to order on March the 8th and it was supposed to be here on the by the 21st of March and I still haven't received it yet this may be my last purchase from you guys until you get your orders in this together | 😍 | Account deletion is a tedious process. | This is the biggest scam I've ever seen!!!!

Not sure what the extra cost was but if prices of items aren't the same as when you check out then what's the point in having them there. Very misleading. | Scam. After reading the reviews,you have lost a customer! I'm not wasting my time or money on schein | When I learn of shein it was 😮 to see Style layout are neatly organized..quality is very good and price is really affordable.

Please help me with this. | This app was my favorite and I buy there all the time, but recently they become awful. The customer service is ridiculous.They don't help they are intentionally.Drag you along just not to give you a refund. They don't have a common sense. And they don't understand apparently english cause every time they react differently to what I say. Potato, and they answer me cheesecake. There is no connection between both of the things. I'm really angry and I think how I can make. Something | Worst experience of my life 😡😤💢💢💢💢😡😡🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 never download 🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🙅🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 | greate verry good | Trash. You have no options but have to draw the gift before using the app. Which is a scam | It would be nice that you can be able to delete items out of your wish list. Some items are appearing in your wish list which I did not select. Since I cannot place online orders I order via someone else, but is not able to remove items from your wish list. Please accomodate us | This app kinda goes hard, just like how hard you make the little Asian kids work every year 🔥🔥🔥 | Very excellent | Amazing! | My dad placed and order and payed for everything but nothing came they said the will send it but it's never came and they never gave my dad his money back and we are still waiting and when this happened was last year we never got a reply back nothing we send so many messages but no response no reply nothing We want our money back | Spent 60€ on an order in december. It's near april now and it still hasn't arrived. I called the company delivering the order and they said my package still hasn't arrived from shein. Will never buy anything ever again from shein. | Brilliant | Thank you for my item's I received on 22march everything fitted perfectly and I'm happy with it all, my only gripe is I won 300 point's and I was only given 150. | When i see a top i would want to buy, i look at the sizes (I'm an M), but when i look at the measurements, it's a lot smaller than mine, and tbh it nakes me a bit insecure, It seems like this app is made for poeple that have a skinny figure and the clothes that are in my measurements look aweful, don't make the size L look like it's a size S, PLEASE MAKE IT HOW A SIZE L IS SUPPOSED TO BE | OMG!!! I mean it is such a wonderful app but it is ruining my vibe by all the ads that come out of nowhere like every time I touch something in a game or app to get something A.K.A Shein pops up. I'm fade up and I can't even get out of the ad so I'm literally incredibly furiously in rage right now but there is still a lot of things that I need from Shein.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🙄🙄🙄🙄 | i dont want to see adverts in my fone | Shein is literally the best! I highly recommend | Ahfan Esmail | Good | Very good value love shien shopping. | Maganda Ang Shein shopping kc walang scam kng ano order mo yon talaga Ang matangap mo | Not to bad | تطبيق ❤ | It has a lot of beautiful things and it's doesn't cost to much | Stop sending me ads | I Always Buy From Shien For My School And Bedroom And Clothes Idk What To Do Without It | Quick and love the prices. | I originally had them at 5 starts but heaven help you if you have any issues because trying to contact support is all but impossible and when you finally do get in contact with them they wait until they're 'unable' to help you because your item has been shipped. Very disappointed as I shop with them all the time. I got a very beautiful and fantastic dress for a really affordable price. Like I've bought jeans for more. | Amazing app | Check out the generic responses to comments, this is a perfect example of the Shein customer service experience ... cut and paste BS Here we go again... 🤣...... Hi! Hope you have a nice shopping experience here.... | I love shein but lip products or any makeup product for that matter doesn't ship to smaller countries. Pls start to ship make products to smaller countries | have lots of stuff | I am rating this 0 not 1! You don't deserve to have a rating. I ordered a nice blouse and pants. The package was delivered and I paid it. When I opened the package it was a different item. It looks like dirty rags! My real order is now in the sorting center and I paid for items that I didn't order! I called the rider but he refused to give me his name. I suspect I was duped. The rider created a n order that I never ordered so he can get my money! Customer service sucks. Never order here!!!!!!!!! | Scam inyo promo | not sold on this app | Great place to buy nice and quality clothes | For shopping, works well. But Shein resets the setting so that they can sell my info almost every single day. Today they reset it 3 times. Extremely scummy. | Yes here I am | ewwww | Stop scrolling me to the bottom of the page after I add something to my cart. That is so annoying. | Bruh, why i can't make a account 😒 | Does what it say*s on the tun | Slowly delivery | Ever since I used Shein, it's always been free shipping. Well, not anymore. SF is even higher than the actual item/s I am buying. Thought of you're a VIP, you always get free shipping as courtesy. Oh well... Hello Temu 💚 | really good | Great | Pretty good | are you not going to make a cod payment? because im a cod user. | They said if i purchased at least 1 item then i would get 5 (cheap) free gifts and i bought 2 things and they wouldn't give me the gifts. Temu will if it said to purchase something to get the gift. I've got 3 of them now. So i invited people and they accepted it and it still won't let me get anything free. They lie when they say you get a free gift. I tried to cancel my order but it won't go through. I tried to delete my account but i have to apply? Whole thing is stupid | Scammed me and my gf | What a waste of 45 mins. I opened to get an offer of free delivery and buy 1 get 2 free. Saved 3 items to basket and thought I'll continue shopping, picked a few more items. I go back to my basket, my first lot are gone and standard delivery costs applied. After scrolling and scrolling I'm not going to repeat this process, sorry but lost this customer before you started with a poor e-commerce platform. They have tried to gamify the process, free crystals, games to pick a card but it's a con | This app is kaka | Good quality products and clothing | Not only does this fast-fashion app involve child labour that pays poor wages for extended amount of shifts, it also takes 7-8 days for the shipping to actually arrive, products will be one-time use or badly designed clothes that undo after 5 months max. Alongside all this baffling execution, they have added in MULTIPLE SCAMS, which gives false hope that you will win extra money and spend it for free. Overall waste of time and money. Any good review is definitely a robot! | App is very glitchy. I cannot place an order or play games on it. | Wow | I brought something from here last year and it never came 😭 | It's good for every one💖😁☺️💝 | It's been 5 weeks and it's supposed to be here 2 weeks ago | Great shopping experience. | Okay, I need size 11 dress shoes. You don't have any. Or some flat shoes to wear. Help me get some shoes in my size. | Fantastic clothes and the price is reasonable you can get different options and styles from children to adults. | I have so much ordering from shein highly recommend ❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Shein has been a life saver. Say goodbye to buying expensive and hello to affordable shopping! Shein hsd the cutest clothes for toddler girls. Their fashion game has been on point lately and I saw things that really caught my eye. I love that they also cater to plus size women. I've finally found my style through Shein. Go Shein! 💕 would be nice if yall can make womens socks, shoes for women like me with larger feet at least a size 11.5-12 and if yall made more J-fashion type clothes. | i can download every app i want | BLippi | Thank you for honesty service | Like it | Taking the rest and getting 😴 😌 | I absolutely love this app. The clothes are great, and they're true to there size listed, and they fit very well.

At first it was fine from before and now I can't get anything from my account so I had use my son's account from Shein sorry I have to delete it | Good application | Good | Good | The estimated price is a scam, the final price is always higher.

You cannot pickup a package without app install, email, phone, blueutooth and location access. And nobody tells you all this when you select shipping by packeta... Instant uninstall, will never use again. | Decided to try z-box delivery. Got an email urging to pay the cod amount in app. Downloaded the app. First thing i see, probably, a package for someone else (very distant delivery box). Unable to find where to enter card details or connect with Google pay. Frustrated. Terrible service. Poor UX. | Application was working well for pickups. But I cannot send package as the payment via card always freezes - app stops responding. | This app is an absolute trash. If I could give zero stars I would give like 6 times. Unable to use it without wi-fi as it says I am not connected to the internet. Surprisingly I was and stood near the pickup point for 20 minutes to make it work. DO NOT use this to ship packages. You say in the comments shipping and receiving packages should be easy and you are right, SHOULD. You failed miserably. At least you got my personal data and location information. Great job. | An app to open a package box. After phone and email verification. What a joke. After i get this package your app will be deleted for sure, never to be reinstalled. | I am currently planning to drive to the Packeta pickup point, but struggling to receive the verification code to my phone. As I am reading the rating comments this is not a unique issue, I am suggesting to get that generic issue solved. This is just not okay that I have to call for support for such a simple task... you should find another solution, such as pin code via sms or bar code via email. So that your customers are not having a negative experience. | worst package delivery app ever. the app doesn't work and they don't respond to emails. | No sms, no package. Thanks for not having a fallback method, like qr code or web site - first and last time I ordered into a z-box. | Fajn služba, škoda že nejde nahadzovať údaje zásielky na počítači, kde by sa dali z mailu pohodlne kopírovať údaje na zaslanie. Na mobile je to mierne nepraktické. | Useless. Sms message not arriving, even with 3 retries | Edit: seems it's due to maintenance, but you have to read the website to get this info. Would be nice if it was posted in the app itself. Hopefully it will work tomorrow. Won't let me enter my email. I get an error message 'oops something went wrong, please try again later'. Tried reinstalling, clearing cache etc, no luck..any help would be appreciated. Why not just use a code? Any time something goes wrong with the app you're out of luck getting your package. | Very good delivery app | App is not working, I could not log into or register. How am I gonna pick my parcel from z-box? | Vždy když chci poslat zásilku tak aplikace spadne. Po přeinstalaci se do aplikace ani nejde přihlásit a kód na ověření emailu hází error. Webstranka nema navic funkcionalitu takze nejde delat nic. Otevření záložky ""pobočky"" automaticky shodí aplikaci i když vypnu polohu | Always crashes with payment for me.....:((( | Pohodlné a príjemné odosielanie ale ceny by mohli byť zobrazené na prvej stránke pre lepší prehľad. | Neexistujuci support. Velmi amaterske. | This app actually deserves 0 stars, not 1, because it shouldn't even exist. Any other package service let's me unlock the locker with a simple code. Not this one. It's a shameless data grab, which takes a process that should normally take 30 seconds at worst, and turns it into a 5+ minute ordeal, requiring registration, phone number verification, location and bluetooth access. Shame on you. In the future I will make sure to use literally any other service when recieving packages. | Horrible idea, and a worse app. Opening the z-box through Bluetooth just so your fingertip doesn't touch a screen? Extremely poor excuse. First package was okay and I uninstalled. Now I need to pick up one more and the app freezes immediately when I'm supposed to input my phone number. You dropped the ball on this one, Packeta. Please take user feedback seriously. Canned responses won't do. Oops,an error occurred... | Mám přehled kde se balík nachází. Skvēlý nápad, škoda že Vám to Balíkovna takhle ukradla. | I think, that it is the best service, because it offers also returning items to eshops and paying for items | Procedure is the worst imaginable. As if someone compiled all the bad ideas of other services into one. Must: register email, phone number, personal data, enable Bluetooth, enable location, give access to literally everything, so the APP can get all package data, track your movement, and open the box automatically when you approach it. I use this only when I have no other option and than immediately delete after I am done. Edit: app is fine, works perfectly. 5 star if data harvesting is removed. | Měla by být možnost uložení kontaktů. | I am standing for 10 minutes and trying to understand how to open a locker. Just put a normal touch screen on the automatic box like all the other companies. For what is all my data needed? | Zdieľanie zásielky stvorilo použiteľnú appku. Nie je možné vymazať zapamätanú platobnú kartu! | Plná spokojenost. | Katasztrofálisan bonyolult. Más szolgáltatóknál megadok egy számkódot, odatartom a kártyaolvasóhoz a bankkártyát, és ennyi. Itt alkalmazás letöltés, kártyaadatok begépelése, email verifikáció, sms verification. Szóval katasztrófa az egész folyamat. | I received sms about having package in zbox but it doesn't appear in the app. Call center only has bot and no operator. I have restarted, installed on the other phone it didn't help. Finally only online support made something and it appeared. Yesterday i spent hours trying to make it work. Your call center is a joke only a bot demandin to say words instead of pushing buttons. | Jednoduché a rýchle, veľa pobočiek... spokojnosť | I have received an email + sms that my package is ready to be picked up, yet it does not appear in the app, so I cannot actually get my package from the delivery box. Very disappointing that there is no other option like a pin code to take over the parcel, only this malfunctioning app!! (yes I registered with the correct phone number...) | Na niektoré zbox sa pri podaní balika nedá vôbec pripojiť a Packeta s tým nič nerobí!!!! | I refuse to use this data harvesting app. There is absolutely no reason that this app needs as many permissions and information as it does. Uninstalled immediately, I will not pick up my order and will have it delivered through another service. And just because packeta ""follows the data protection rules"" doesn't make the data harvesting ok! Why is Packeta forcing people to download an app just to pick up a package? They say it makes the pick up quick and easy, which is bs. Don't use packeta! | Aplikácia mi zablokovala po dodaní na miesto výberu zaplatený tovar. Zákaznícka podpora je vo forme robota, ktorý opakuje stále to isté dokola. Mailová podpora regulovaná robotom, aj napriek priamej požiadavke, nezmyselná odpoveď, na ktorú treba odpovedať, aby vás ""riešili"" 0 bodov z 5. | Nefunkčná | Nula hviezdiciek keby sa da. Nic len trapenie. Vobec nenajde balik a neda sa vyzdvihnut. Horsi system som nezazil. | Wonderful app. I use lot of times. Delivery on time | There is no reason for existence of this app. Just send code through SMS and put payment terminal next to the boxes like other companies already do. The fact that you need to install one-use mobile app and enter personal information is such a pointless and stupid idea. You should fire the person who came up with it. Also it would be nice to warn customers about your practices before they order something. Now I feel tricked, because I wouldn't use your services if I would know how it works. | It's asking for an email when before worked fine with phone number | Wanted to pick up a delivery from a box, downloaded the app, but didnt get the verification text message. 20 minutes later I got all my verification messages in bulk. All of them expired. I couldnt receive my package!! Tried again, no verification message at all. Never experienced this before at any app registration. Just give a PIN in email like the rest of courier box services... | Pathetic that an app is necessary to get my package. Have you heard about the qr code? | 🚨IF YOU WOULD OF GAVE ME THE SAME INFO👉,WHICH YOU ONLY GAVE ME NOW IN YOUR RESPONSE TO MY RATING🤔,I WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY CLIENT(give u 5star)👌💯😈 | APPka byla by skvěla jestli by se dalo odeslat balik. Potřebují odeslat balik, ale když natukam už na payment, tak mi to dal nepustí, že se stala nějaká chyba. Pres počitač zasilku nejde zadat. Užjsem vyzkoušel všechny svoje karty, a žadna nefunguje. Nevím jak mám odeslat balik. Opravte to prosim. Alespon přidejte možnost zadat balik k odeslani pres PC, anebo alespon zaplatit za odeslaní na pobočce při předani. | Ooops, niekde nastala chyba. Trepal som sa vrátiť tovar. Nefunguje to. Kdepak ti soudruzi z NDR udelali chybu. Edit: ako konkrétne tom mám nahlásiť Z-boxu? | app - absolutely useless, generating ""oops error occurred"" messages without error code or any detailed information and there is no backup with entering pin... as for the service - they lost my 300€ package (picking up my box from your box and put it in another box - how is even possible to screw that?!?) and they refunded me 15€. certainly with accordance with terms and condition no doubt... so they actually dont need to deliver anything - they can be profitable just by stealing packages... | Disgusting data harvesting op. It demands your phone number, it demands your e-mail address, it demands location and bluetooth before giving you your package. None of these things are necessary when I could open the locker with a code like GLS does. This entire app is clearly superfluous, cynically deployed for data harvesting purposes. I was forced to use this once, then immediately deleted my account and the app, and I'll make sure never to order from anywhere that uses this ""service"" again. | I will never use this company again. Terrible service, terrible customer service, 1 month and I still don't have the package. No support, lies on top of lies. App works perfectly. But items are not delivered. The item is stuck in the z-box now for 31 days and I still don't have it. Customer service tells me each week that the technician is going to open the zbox soon. Every week they ask me to wait. But after 31 days, it's still in the zbox! Still zero! I will never use this company again :) | Ooops an error has occurred. | 🚨UTTERLY RUBBISH🤮Tried 1hour in the cold ,download app(WHY DOWNLOAD APP,FOR 1 PARCEL?🤣,)nowhere was in App to open Box,NO Phone to Enquire🤫then on Email i find Store inside Plaza,where I was told they got my Parcel😱Incorrect Info not HELP👊1st TIME USE & LAST TIME🫵NEVER AGAIN💯😡😈 | Proc delat veci jednoduse kdyz to jde slozite a pres aplikaci... Sdileni zasilky, ktere bylo drive preposlani emailu, se zmenilo na nutnost sdilet a MANUALNE (i banky umi QR kod/ platbu na tel. cislo) prepisovat idetifikator. Pro otevreni boxu je misto zadani kodu potreba zapnout bluetooth, povolit GPS a nejspise i zapnout data. Priste nez takovy UX nesmysl vypustite do produkce, tak to prosim nejdrive vyzkousejte na sve babicce; ta vam to omlati o hlavu. [edit: vase reakce je uplne mimo] | Trying to return a package from Hun to Cz via the Z box. Not possible as the app only creates a QR code which I cannot read at the Z box to open the door. Why would you tell your customers that they can return a package via the Z box if not possible? | Zbytečná aplikace. | Ted bývalí Zasikovna ted ne stoij za nic, covek ne zveda zajaznicka linka jen robot, na e-mail nygdo ne odpovida , poslal jsem zasilka pred 8 dny v aplikacie je na zatáčce, nygdy ne budu pouzivat navic v ta firma. Když se stezoval zde mi odpovedeli na e mail a pak me poslali do ..., ad napisu njaki formuláře na jei strance.Oni to steije stratil ja to vim :):):) Pretim nygde se nestalo takle a byli Zasilkovna nic společného s ta firma. Bohužel | Well, it worked!! | Byli mi sebraný peníze ale neobdržel jsem zásilku | Nesiel otvorit Z-Box, vsetko potrebne som mal nainstalovane (BT, app, data), z boxu vysiel zvuk podobny tomu pri otvarani boxu. . Operator tvrdil, ze nevidi ziadny problem s boxom. Po piatich pokusoch som musel zasielku presmerovat na vydajne miesto. Packetu viac nebudem pouzivat, po tychto skusenostiach neodporucam vobec Z-Box | Bezchybná aplikácia, spoľahlivá služba. | Aplikacia sa neda spustit, zasielku si neviem vyzdvyhnut, ale ich to iba mrzi, aplikacia mi pravidelne neposiela overovaci kod ked sa tam chcem prihlasit | I have to download an app to receive my packet? What is this bs? | Completely idiotic, apparently nobody at this company expects someone from abroad to come to one of the countries where their terrible service is present and be forced to use them due to a third party vendor. No option for any phone number from a service provider outside of 4 or so countries, and their moronic system just rewrote the phone number the vendor sent them to start with +36 instead of the original country code so now the package is linked to a nonexistent phone number.... | Na Huawei nie je možné inštalovať apku. Veľká chyba | Should I do the delivery part too? | Pathetic that I have to download an app just to receive a package | It handles a specific user input error with a meaningless ""Oops, an error occurred"" error message. In this way, the user does not know that he has messed something up, or if so, what, but rightly assumes that there is a general system error. | I do not want to install your garbage software just to pick up a package. | Not showing pickup places. Unable to send parcel | It is the worst parcel delivery I ever used. Every other company can send a simple pin to pick up the package. Never will use it again. | Feature request. Nedal by se výběr místa doručení volitelně přepingnout na adresáta, aťsi sám vybere a pak bych už jen odeslání potvrdil a dokončil? | Saw a new option in getting a package, saw an app is...required?, App asks for phone number...you have yourself installed to a static phone ID and MAC address??? Why would you need a phone number? If phone number, why app? You could just set a pin in the ordering and link the device with it so only you'll be able to unlock the parcel? Or make the company send you one? Like everyone else? | Using Zasillovna is sometimes great and used to work without any app. Parcel was delivered to a shop nearby and I was very satisfied. But sometimes a package goes to random Z-box. I hate this. Even if I choose to use cash on eshop It only means that I will have to pay by card (no google pay) in this app which I do not want to have anyway. I want my girlfriend to pick my package for me as I do not have smartphone. This is aslo not possible. This scenario forces both of us to have app installed. | The delivery company in RO is a joke. They have 1 week delay and can not fullfill their shipment obligations. worst experience ever | Needs Google Captcha to log in for some reason, and the pickup point picker requires Google Maps. / No, reinstalling will not help unless I re-google my degoogled phone. No, I won't get GSF on my main device to be spied on! Please tell developers to remove GSF (Google Spyware Framework) dependencies, there are FOSS alternatives! | The app does not provide what expected ftom its advertisement. It does not give any real details about the parcel and why it is late. | terrible ux and the app is translated to english, yet you can't install the app if your google account doesnt have right country... Dear Nikola, it might be a surprise for you, but in cz,sk,hu,ro might be living people having home country different and you intentionally choose to avoid these customers... shame... | Sure you need an app and all my data to open a locker Edit: Hi Nicola from Zasilkovna! No, that's exactly my point, you cannot easily pick up packages. You need to download an app, verify your phone number, verify your email address, enable everything one-by-one in settings and then you will be able to open the locker. This is everything but easy. | Horrible that I am required to install an application to receive my package. Will avoid this service in future if I can. | Vsetko funguje ako ma. S appkou som nikdy nemal problem ci uz pri preberani alebo odosielani zasielky. | Aplikace je celkem použitelná, ale instalace emulátoru mobilního telefonu přidává zbytečné komplikace, když mohlo jít o obyčejnou webovou aplikaci. | App could be better, there's weird glitching and phone freezes up when filling in some of the text fields. Restarting the app resolves it. | It doesn't access my contacts so I have to copy/paste it manually in order to send a package. Very tedious if you have 10 packages to be send. The tracking functionality shows much less info than website. | Downloading an app just to get a package is annoying. On top of that it wasn't announced when selecting that delivery option. | If anyone is going to use this trash of a delivery service, don't ever choose Delivery boxes as pickup location as they are always full and your urgent package will stay with courier for 2-3 business days (might even be over weekend) until these imbeciles will find a new place to deliver. What's the problem of taking the package to another delivery place instantly when you see the box is full? | I'm more than just disappointed with this app. If you don't have it, good luck with opening the Z-box and getting your package. For people using Huawei services it is impossible to open Z-box since this app is only available on Google play or iOS. What's more, when I managed to download this app, it wouldn't let me get in anyway. It says that verification of my number has failed. What is the reason behind that? I had no other choice than to ask my family to help me with that. | couriers steal and somehow lose shipments of higher value packages ​​and packeta returns you only a minimum amount or nothing at all. Customer service sucks. Scammers | Alzabox je lepsi. Da sa platit kartou pri preberani. | Spravil som jednu objednávku, doručovali ju v 5 balíkoch, 4 doručili kam som zvolil v objednávke, 1 balík (akurát čo najviac potrebujem) do iného mesta. Žiadny dotaz, či si to želám doručiť neskôr, alebo inam, nič. Tak som volal (10 minút mi tykali a hrali hudbu), potom pani hovori, že to vraj presmeruju, ale musím počkať pár dní (čo už). A ze kam to chem. No akurát to nebude tam, kde bývam, ale do nejakého iného mesta! Toto čo je za služby?!?! Veď som si tu práve vyzdvihol 4 balíky?! Otras! | Výborná aplikace - je jednoduchá, rychlá a intuitivní. Jednu věc bych poprosil zlepšit - kdy vyhledávám pobočku pro vyzvednutí na mapě se zobrazí jenom pobočky podle filtru, ale často hledám nějakou vedlejší, tak další pobočky se pri zmenšení mapy neobjeví. Bylo by to hezké při zmenšení mapy zobrazit i další pobočky, které nespadají do filtru. Děkuji. | Nice, ale teraz uz cena za balík je taká vysoká, ze sa sami uz viac oplatí doruenie na adresu. Ostatne je ok Edit: zvycajne mam iba odoslanie zadarmo. Bolo by super keby Za balik bolo kolo 2€ | 1. Using ZBOX is a PITA and not really working, just a mess. 2. More recent, I got to know that the days someone is allowed to pick up a parcel are calendar days. This means that if the pick up point goes on a 14 days holiday break, the parcel will be returned to sender, because the recipient only has 6 days to pick it up. 3. Customer Support is useless at best and offending at worst. Twice already came out of it angry and dissapointed. Maybe just stick with Ceska Posta/PPL. | Why do I have to install and create an account, just to receive my package... | Celkem zbytečná aplikace. Sice se mi ukážou zásilky, ale bez jakýchkoli detailů (třeba času doručení nebo hesla pro vyzvednutí). Když zkusím zásilku přidat manuálně, tvrdí mi, že jde o neplatné heslo. Takže je to vcelku na nic. | To pick up parcel you need: i) inst app ii)bluetooth iii)gps iiii)phone numb iiiii) 20 min untill IA get your problem. Each implementation team should incl. psychogist who would explain to decision makers, that nothing simpliest as 4 pin code does not exisit and will not be invented in near future. As back up solution this should be implemented when any further upgrade considering. My problem was incorect spelled phone number. Simply problem. | Nepříjemná služba, ubohá aplikace. | Nincs funkció vintedes feladásra | Spent 10 minutes at the box to finally get my package. | dobra appka, ale urcite by som privital ukladanie/archiv adries pri odosielani zasielok. | Great service, great app. | You need this to open the locker. Guys, look around and learn from the user experience design of the whole hungarian delivery box market (excluding your) | POZOR! Svojvolne bez suhlasu adresata menia adresu dorucenia na novu adresu niekolko kilometrov od povodneho miesta dorucenia! A ked ich na to par minut po obdrzani ""informacneho emailu"" obratom upozornite, odpisu Vam, ze zasielku nevedia presmerovat na povodnu adresu, kym nie je dorucena na nimi zvolenu novu adresu! A potom sa na to aj tak vykaslu a zasielku nechaju hnit na novej nimi zvolenej adrese dorucenia.. | Přátelé, takto ne. K otevření boxu musí člověk poskakovat před boxy, instalovat aplikaci, potvrzovat email, potvrzovat telefonní číslo, povolovat oprávnění pro aplikaci... Z-box jsem použil poprvé a naposled. Toto lze vymyslet lépe. Stačí se podívat na okolní boxy. | The tracking in the app is useless. You get more details and updates on the website tracker than on the app. | The quality of service provided by Zásilkovna recently rapidly dropped. They seem they took too much work and they are getting lost in it. They are randomly redirecting your shipments to different locations, not caring that the locations are temporarily closed. They have big delays and their support is extremely hard to reach because on their support phone number is sitting just a dumb voice robot which is not capable of anything but hanging the calls. This is not complaint about one package. | vsetko olrajt | Have a day to pick up package, take a half day of holidays to be able to pick it up. App calims it is too late to pick up the package. There goes the Christmas present for my daughter. If ever a company says they are using this service I will do my best to find an alternative where they don't use this abysmal user experience | why should we use this? the other shipping companies can use qr codes in email instead of this application(foxpost etc.) | Switching to hungarian doesn't work at all..how did this ever get past QA? Needs to be hotfixed ASAP. Edit: The Google Play page is in czech as well. Maybe there is a misconfiguration on the play console? Edit 2: The package pickup feature randomly disappeared from the app. This is unacceptable. One of the worst apps I have ever used. It's so bad that as an android developer it makes me feel ashamed of my profession. | Rychlé, srozumitelné, spolehlivé. | Pro odeslání zásilky kupodivu potřebujete aplikaci na mobilu, i když webová by bohatě stačila. No a novém mobilu se do ní nemohu přihlásit - ""Ověření vašeho čísla se nezdařilo. Můžete to zkusit znovu."" Děje se to už pár dní. Snad není na přihlášení potřeba Google Play Services! Podpora je k ničemu. | Balíček se zaseknul na nějakém depu. Pomocí aplikace lze kontaktovat podporu pomocí emailu či mobilu Bohužel ani jeden způsob nahlášení problému nevede k řešení. Stále se mi nikdo neozval s informací, kdy bude balíček doručen | Can't register, you are supposed to receive a confirmation code via SMS, but it's not happening. | Straightforward and easy to use | Disaster of an app. Payments used to work at least 50% of the time before, but since last update they just do not work. I get a loading icon and then the app resets to previous screen with no error message or no way to do anything about it. Re-installing, changing payment methods -nothing works. What a joke. | Objednávam často z packety. Čo má mrzí je to že nemajú presnú lokaciu kde uvidím kuriéra. Bolo by dobré keby to tam pridajú | App is functional, but has Ads in the notifications. There is only one notification category so there is no possibility to disable the ad notifications. Be prepared, that your phone will be spammed. I received a response here, that there shoulbe 3 cathegories, but this is a lie. I see only one cathegory. Miscellaneous. One star. | Miezerie de aplicatie, companie etc....suport client inexistent...inutila 100%. Nici o jumatate de stea nu merita | Užitečná a přehledná aplikace. Jen jsem měl opakovane problem s platbou pri odesilani baliku. | Alza nepotrebuje žiadnu app. Kód príde cez sms email. Táto aplikácia vyžaduje polohu a ešte aj Bluetooth. Nečudoval by som sa keby sa prevalilo ze takto získané dáta predávate ďalej. Za mňa radšej balikoBox alebo alzaBox kde na vyzdvihnutie stačí pár čísel. |  | It wont open the box | Can't switch accounts on one phone number. | There is absolutely no need to install an application just to pick up an order from a shop. The fact, that there is no other option, even when you call the ""help"" line standing in front of the box is frankly outrageous. I have used Zasilkovna in the past, but will avoid it after this horrible experience. And based on the reply they employ people who cannot read. | The app is pretty much useless - does not show any details like the web tracking, does not show information from SMS which is sent in day of delivery. Basically just tells you the package exists. Waste of space. | Useless, no tracking available, late status change updates, support calls with Garbage AI. | Great app, super easy to send and receive parcels and packages. | Žádná aplikace mě tak spolehlivě nenasere jako když jdu vyzvednout zásilku v Z-Boxu. Úspěšnost je tak 30%, ve zbylých případech ""nastane chyba"". Nejlepší na tom je že na vyzvednutí máte jen omezený čas, takže se vám taky může dost dobře stát, že zásilka bude další den odeslána zpět! Kdyby to byl jen nějaký dočasný problém, tak to pochopím, ale s problémy při vyzvedávání se potýkám opakovaně a nelepší se to... I Česká Pošta má lepší UX a to je co říct! 🤬 | When registering app no possible to login with phone number. After typing number no possible to continue. This not working on Xiaomi 5. Mi9 is ok. | I ordered package with COD but after clicking on Pay payment gate will not open, so I'm not able to get package which is literally next to me locked in box. | Have to pass through captcha during login :⁠-⁠\ | Zjednodusuje dopravu balikov, ale appka je strasne spomalena pri platbach a preberani balikov. | Shuts down after update. Works as before after reinstalling. But another bad experience today - in the store app stopped to work, could not show the QR code. Had to use ID card :-( Several minutes before everything was OK. SMS sent by shopkeeper came just after the whole sad procedure was carried out... | Can't see my order. I can't open the zbox.... | Forces me to use an app to get my pacakge, because this is the only way to open the box. And only for my phone number, email and location data. Wow. | Aplikacia zial nefunguje. Ani po restarte telefonu. Podla google play update nepotrebujem, mam verziu 1.18.6. Kedze ocakavam balik do z-boxu, budem rada ak problem v aplikacii co najskor odstranite. nerada by som, aby sa uz zaplatena zasielka v nemalej cene vratila naspat odosielatelovi. Dakujem. Vymazala som cache a storage. Celkove preinstalovanie nebolo potrebne. Iba sa znovu prihlasit a urobit nastavenia tel.cisla..... | Chrashing after recent update - unusable | Had I known I need to download an app just to get to my package, I would've never chosen this service. Every other option just sends a code in text message. It's silly. | Useless application, doesn't work at all,after the verification for not being a robot,no SMS it's send to me | Unpeasant experience on first time use of Packeta. Could not manage to ship a package after paying for it. Customer service not available after 6pm, so good luck getting some help on later deliveries. Had to use Cargus app instead, much easier to use and 30% cheaper. | Cannot register, sometimes gives captcha sometimes just asks to to type in sms code. Which i do not get. Not even after multiple attempts, restart, reinstall... | Pickup of packet doesn't need an app, not everything needs an app, do it like everyone else, simply send a sms/email with code i can open it with, not downloading an app, register, give you a lot of info just for picking up a packet, then enable Bluetooth and location just so i can open the box. Just bcs we are pushed to download it doesn't mean we like the app, get better | worst delivery service I have ever used, they say that the package arrived in the box, and I was trying to open the ""z_box"" with banch of other people and it didn't work and their customer support is not even replying..do not recommend at all! | The box does not give the parcel till it's paid. That's clear. But there is no way how to pay. The app keeps telling you to update your contact info but even if you do so the payment is not possible. Worst parcel delivery boxes. I never had problem with any other delivery boxes. I won't use Zasilkovna ever again. | Can't even register properly Asks for a phone number, on the left side you can choose the country number pretext but when you try to enter the number it wants you to put a ""+"" in front. You have your pretext on the left! When I include the pretext, it is too long. I tried any reasonable way of writing a phone number but it's still invalid. There's not even an example. EDIT: Managed to register and also got a quick reply, so changing the amount of stars to show some gratitude. | nanutena aplikacia. iba neschopna firma vyzaduje na otvorenia boxu spustit aplikaciu na internete spolu s aktivnym BT a GPS... okamzite odinstalovana a nikdy viac | It doesn't work | Too much personal data collected for a shipment service! Thank you, but I'd rather use the web-site! Or just use Ceska Posta !! Edit: No, thank you Nikola. As I said I don't like the amount and type of data the app gathers. And yes, I did read the privacy policy! Not a chance to give it a chance! | It's beyond my understanding why they need so much access to personal info just to deliver a package. All the other poins use a code (and a qr code), not this level of invasion of privacy. How can I make sure now that this business dose not hold any personal info? | Coletul stă de 3 zile în Bihor | Vyzvednutí z boxu je oproti jakémukoliv konkurenčnímu řešení zbytečně složité a zdlouhavé. Aplikace náhodně hlásí, že zásilka byla doručena a poté až u boxu nahlásí, že zásilka je stále na cestě, zatímco v SMS zprávách stále svítí zpráva o doručení zásilky a vy jste vyhodili hodinu času cestováním k boxu. Prakticky neexistující zákaznická podpora, pouze bot na telefonu který na vše hlásí, že vám nerozumí. Měl jsem zasilkovnu vždy rád, ale jejich pokusy o digitalizaci jsou tragické. | They often change pick-up point without giving a chance to choose the more suitable one for me. I don't see any sense in using Z-Boxes anymore. Update: nothing in the spam folder | Skvělá práce. Nevím, zda M.Altair V. má něco společného s appkou, ale funguje přesně jak má. Čekám, zda bude zase nějaký game changer 😉 | I am not judging applitation itself but the service. They were suppose to ship packet in time but it is still in depot after a few days without any explanation. | Useless Edit: I found annoying installing app only to pickup a package. Sharing redundant info from mobile. I'd prefer other couriers which box allows open via PIN sent in sms/email. Even a link in the tracking info/email would be easier. And you can't ask other person to pick it | Aplikace je celkem pěkná. Je fajn že ukazuje i příchozí zásilky včetně upozornění. Pár připomínek ale mám. Například při zadávání zásilky pro odeslání když se chci vrátit o krok zpět, tak jediná možnost je vše zahodit a zadávat znova. Také se mi stalo, že jsem byl na konečné obrazovce kde se má provést platba, přepnul jsem na jinou aplikaci a po návratu zmizel výběr platební metody, už nešlo pokračovat a musel jsem zadávat od začátku. | Nefunguje spolehlivě. Někdy se k boxu nepřipojí, někdy zase nejde zaplatit pro příliš mnoho přesměrování, někdy prostá zamrzne. | Po pouziti hned odinstalovane. Dovod: dal som si poslat balik do Packetaboxu na dobierku. Musel som si stiahnut tuto aplikaciu, zadat telefon, email, povolit polohu a ked som chcel zaplatit, tak aj zadat udaje z karty. Ale apka oznamila, ze sa musim prihlasit do internet bankingu a potvrdit platbu, takze som sa musel otocit pre pocitac a citacku, zopakovat platbu, aktivovat hotspot, prihlasit do bankingu, potvrdit platbu... nie dakujem, zlaty alzabox. Nabuduce Packeta len na nejaku predajnu. | Borzalmas atlathatatlan, nem felhasznalo barat az egesz ugy ahogy van!! | Miért nem vehetem át a csomagomat sima emailes kóddal mint az összes többinél? 👎 | The app has been downloaded but the sms does not want to come trhough with the code. | Not working... z-box only beep and not open. No error displayed. Previous versions works ok. | dureaza 3 zile sa vina pachetu din depozit la 15 minute distanta pana la pickup point | Hulladék fos. Elcserélik a csomagod és te nem kapod vissza soha...de a PÉNZED se. | Recaptcha needed to use the app does not work | Box dost slabota, alza a gls maju aspon panel na pin, na packetu musim mat data a gps zapnute, nikdy viac. | Very poor communication, even though it is Electronic? useless, waste of time Is there nobody able to think in Packeta,...., I needed to get my package in time, why shall I waste my time, doing your job?? Will you give me money for that? Try to use your ""service"" and you will have all the answers you might wonder... if you take try's on customers, you get the feedback you got... | Společnosti, z ktere se stává nova pošta, každý dělá co a jak chce a nelze tomu zabránit. Zaprvé jste ztratili balík a skoro měsíc později ho našli, poslali zpět ale musel jsem zaplatit dobírku sám sobě. Potom jste vratili balík který byl jen jeden krok od doručení, protože údajně přesahoval velikost což není pravda, prošel depo v Praze Včera jsem psal že treti balík stoji týden na podacím místě a ne chybě se. Stačí tolik, posílám už roky ale zadní dobu kvalita a spolehlivost hodně upadly. | Horrible experience using their boxes and the app. Just use the national post, even that js somehow a better option. | It's a great app, no problems, very simple and the Z-box opening is well made and reliable. | nice | váš spôsob preberania balíkov nemá budúcnosť, aby bolo nutné na prebratie balíka mať: nainštalovanú aktuálnu verziu aplikácie Packeta; zapnutý Bluetooth; zapnuté polohové služby (GPS); prihlásenú aplikáciu pod rovnakým telefónnym číslom, aké je uvedené na zásielke; -zabudnite, aplikáciu som odinštaloval a nikomu neradím využívať takýto paškvíl, naštastie máte veľkú konkurenciu, ktorá takéto nezmysly nevyžaduje. | Ok. Bolo by skvele pridat aj moznost v prehlade o zasielke zobrazit cislo uctu pre dobierku. | Neumí zásilky vložené ručně, mimo registrovaný telefon. Nebo některé zásilky Zasilkovny (netestoval jsem to dlouhodobě), které jiné aplikace uměly zobrazit. Celkem slabé. | so, for normal person, for tracking packages, it's useless, and here's why. When you use the website, you can see at which points what happened, in the app you cant, you get an amazon style progress bar, without any actual info or times. The other thing is, it sends you a notification when the packages arrive. which you also get trough email, and since it's 21st century, that email also gives you a notification. Basically it offers less functionality than the website. :/ | A vzorek ranní moči pro vyzvednutí balíku nechcete? | Aplikacia na sledovanie zasielok a na otvorenie boxu sluzi bez problemov. | Aby som mohol odoslať zasielku tak potrebujem zadať meno. To ale spraviť nejde. A prosím zasielkovnu aby mi tu nrdavali jednoduchý koment do odvedi že si mám ""stiahnuť najnovšiu verziu"". Tu stiahnutu mám. Len vy máte nepoužiteľnu aplikáciu | App cant find pick up point could not pick up my order | I've been trying to send a package for 2 days, but I can't, because it doesnt let me save my personal infornation! It deletes them every time I go back to the ""send a parcel"" screen. Also last time, when I was waiting for an authentication code, it didn't send it right away, but at 3 AM when I was already asleep. Only negative experiences so far, it's horrible! | So just to get my package I have to use your app? What a great way to lose customers. | My first time using this service. I'm unable to log in with my phone number because i'm appearantly not connected to the internet. (...I'm in fact connected) After several attempts i hope it will be fixed, like, pretty soon, or there is an alternate ways to open the box. I can't believe this is the only way. Edit: The app still doesn't work with mobile data connection. I have internet, but it doesn't work with it. Only wifi. But i don't have wifi everywhere. | Pro sledování zásilek je lepší web, je tam víc informací, nevím, proč nemohou být i v aplikaci. Musíte si vybrat domovskou pobočku, případně vám ji aplikace vybere sama, když žádnou mít nastavenou nechcete, protože si zásilky necháte posílat pokaždé jinam, tak máte smůlu. | I used to have a good experience with this app, but currently I'm not even able to send a parcel, as I'm not getting any options for delivery places. I checked that location services are turned on and even reinstalled the app, but it still doesn't work. Very bad user experience. | Too long delivery, and no human support, definitely NOT recommending Update: This delivery tooked 4 days. It's repetitive experience. This company can't deliver in 1 business day, as they promiss. Never happend that. If you have possibility choose another parcel service. | Velmi zly UX aplikacie, neda sa ulozit rozpracovana zasielka ako koncept, suma dobierky je predvolena na 1 euro namiesto toho aby tam uzivatel hodnotu vypisal, tym padom to sposobuje chyby s vaznym financnym dopadom. A nazvat zasielanie ""Medzi nami"" netusim kto vymyslel, ale zasluzil by si cenu nejaku... | Při vyzvednutí cizí zásilky nelze provést platbu za tuto zásilku. Nechápu proč se to nepřevede do aplikace s možností platby. | Not able to access after update to latest version 1.18.1. Apps shows error ""it seems you are not connected to internet. After several tries gives me captcha window which I fullfil and than same error for internet interuption. ReCaptcha service is not working. UPDATE: Issue was solved by using sms verification instead of captcha. Cheers Aleksandar | extremely bad, when i want to return a parcel by a ZBOX, it asks for a code received by the app, but the app didn't give me a code, PPL is so much better than this | highly unsatisfactory. will steal your phone number, email, location, bluetooth and read all your sms. this app is so unnecessary. same functionality could be achieved with simple qrcode from web link. this is PUP/PUA UPDATE: for dev who responded respond to whole complain or you just proving my point by trying to cover only half of it. and yes you could do the same with webapp which isnt that privacy intrusive. | Useless app. Samsung s22 ultra and it gives me errors. Reinstalled 3 timed S. I have the latest version. Almost couldnt send my package. Issue: brand new installation. Login works. Lower Main menu i click parcel or smg like that and the app just drops/goes to main screen in my phone. It gives no error message. Tried 10 times minimum. Update: yes i managed because the lady was able to search my name in the system. The app did not work. | Meh | This is the worst delivery service i have ever had the misfortune of trying, i ordered something and had it come in one of their ""zboxes"" only for it to arrive and not show in the app. Their broken app just said i wasn't receiving anything even though i received a mail saying that i did. This my third time ordering and it never went as smooth as it should. I will never order anything with them again | Nevie sa spárovať a stále ma to odhlasuje | This app is a disaster! Rarely works. Often you end up standing at the pick up spot and you can't make the payment, or the app is showing repeated unknown error, with no guidance nor possibility to get support. I recommend avoiding this service. | does not even let me register | I cannot use the app , because it says I am not connected to the internet, although I am home and I am DEFINITELY connected. Reinstalled app several times, the same thing. And every time before they tell me I am not connected to the internet I go through at least 2 verifications to prove that I am not a robot. Super annoying... Plus, why do I need a special app just to pick up a package? Bad solution! | Po poslední aktualizaci přestalo fungovat 'Vyzvednout cizí zásilku'. === 2023-08-26: Aplikace nefunguje, zcela nesmyslně hlásí, že nemám připojení k internetu. HW: Samsung A33 | No problem with app itself. I am pissed, that I have to download app to get my package Edit. Not only app, you need to be phisicaly close with your phone to box. It really sucks as no one can get your package if they dont have your phone | Nejde odeslat zásilku. Aplikace při klik na Pay řekne jen ""Oops. error occurred"". Podpora nedokáže nic vyřešit. Reinstall taky nic. Fungovat bez aplikace neumí. Udělejte to přes web, jako všichni ostatní příčetní jedinci a nepřidělávejte problémy. Chyba reportována podpoře, ale je jim to jedno. Nic nevyřešili. Aplikaci nefunguje stále. Re: Nikča je robot, který odpovídá, aniž by četl na co odpovídá? Zásilku se nepovedlo odeslat, tedy není žádné číslo. ‚Zákaznický servis‘ nic nevyřešil. Opakovaně | Unstable and unreliable! First time I want to use this service but I am far from being impressed. The app is not intiutive, I need to re register all my details evry time I open it .. I am not going to use this service ever again once I get m package. | Vynikající nápad vynutit používání aplikace pro otevření boxu. Buď bude uživatel mít nainstalovanou aplikaci úplně k ničemu nebo si jí musí instalovat zbytečně kvůli jedné zásilce za uherský rok. Prosím vás k tomu jsou instant apps. Když chcete nutit aplikace, tak ať se mi stáhne u toho boxu jednorázově malá aplikace. Inspirujte se u Qerko. Za tu odpověď bych dal 0 hvězdiček kdyby to šlo 😶 Řešení je vytvořit aplikaci která má pár MB a můžu si ji stáhnout před boxem, ne že jí budu dávat šanci | Waiting for sms for hours. Than the list of z-box destinations is empty without any error message. Grandma would help to collect my parcels as she do for other lockers but she didn't born with built-in bluetooth, so this not old people compatible. | Disaster.

Při posledním nákupu jsem byl při placení v pokušení vyprázdnit košík a odejít. Na pokladně totiž může na zákazníka vyskočit položka, kterou opravdu nečekal, po odečtení slev je sice částka přijatelnější, ale 100% jistotu zákazník při placení nemá.

Nějaký způsob aktivace na příští nákup by bylo mnohem lepší řešení. | no way I am rating you good when you stick the review prompt in my face | 👍 | Absolutely pitiful. Tried to scan my existing clubcard, waited 10mins to do it all over, multiple passwords created....in the end back to square one. A wonderful way to waste your time. Best of luck to all who try! | An unexpected error occured during registration for several weeks. | easy, well working | U aktualni objednavky se nezobrazuje pocet objednanych polozek a jejich cena. Proc se tam zobrazuji aktualni ceny? | I keep getting the message that an unexpected error occured when I try to register.I sent an email to the czechia team days ago but no response. | I am not able to see my detailed bills only the sum. Today I have faced the same issue. No info what I have purchased in the app. All your competitors have this info albert, billa, lidl they even have possibility not to print bill which is environmentally friendly but yours has only sum. The email on website is a joke no response since I wrote my firts review here. | Debilni kartičky na všechno. Ať jsou s tim firmy do.. | impossible to sign into the app. after entering your login details, the ""continue"" button literally just doesn't work, you can't press it. this needs a fix | Can't input my B.D. | During signing in, the app asks for club card number which is available only after sign in process in case of electronic clubcard. Seams like Tesco thinks that clubcard number is one of the most important numbers in your life... Nonsense. Edit after response: registration emails usually ends up in spam and they are deleted after certain period of time. My point is the security nonsense of the app, what is the point of authentication using email and password when you also need to store the card number. If for some reason, you need to match the security to the level of fintech apps with 2FA, at least add an option to use second verification with a text message as the sane developers do. | Not really compatible Has more issues to get back to initial registration process. Once you scan the card then you do not have an option to delete or reenter new card. Not satisfied with app's user friendliness | good | I love it. | je to fajn, hodily by se e-uctenky. | I uninstalled the app and when I reinstalled it, it wanted the ClubCard number, but I didn't remember it. Why isn't the card bound to my account? I won't screenshot it and have it unnecessarily stored in cloud. Thanks for nothing tesco :/ | voucher discounts are difficult to track | App is broken. Can't register, can't sign in. Unexpected error all around the place | If I could give you minus points, I would. It is going from bad to worse. I don't care how good your appp is, marketing sucks. Sick with getting coupons for goods out of stock in all shops for months on end or goods you never actually buy. Totally overpriced as at Jan 2022, low quality goods, especially veges, better go to Albert and Billa in Czechia. Club card discounts are veey few, if at all and discounted goods in Tesco are more expensive than the same regular priced goods at other stores. | way much better then before.. | nice application | Nefunkční adventní kalendář | I have issues with adventni calendar: the app closes when I tap to open event - I have it on Xiaomi redmi note 4, maybe it is phone issue? Can you advice what can I do? Otherwise - great app! Using it often:) | An excellent app full of rewards and discounts | It's great to see many countries listed for the app. But No English❓ | good application I love it.. | I could not even finish a registration :( | useless app, didn't manage to login and add my tesco card points | Useful | pomalé, nechybí elektronické účtenky | Statements still doesn't work | Would be nice, when I order food online it would add all my available discounts automatically. | I gave tried for months to get it to work and I find it impossible. | Super application. Many thanks to the developers for their sophistication. The application is simple, has easy operation and the advantage is that it has a Widget. Good work... | Stupid name. I look it up in the list of my apps and it is NOT at T as tescomobile. | failed to log in with newly created account which was blocked again in a few minutes after resetting password | Statements don't work at all (none load despite there being at least 5 payments I made recently) and it seems the applied coupons take a while to get marked as used, butbotherwise seems good, works fine for me. Edit regarding response: Both of those make sense, good to know. I'm giving 5 stars because neither is really a problem then; I thought statements would appear immediately. | Never works when I try to login | I never had so many problems with an app until now. Keep it. I uninstalled all 3 Tesco apps. | Created a club card oonline through the app, loggesout tried to login again , it keep asking me to scan card or enter it manually, why and how since the card is on the app | Naprosto k nicemu. Nejde se ani zaregistrovat. Jakmile se pokusim vytvorit novy ucet, rovnou to oznami ze ucet je blokovany kvuli chybnemu pokusu o prihlaseni. Nekolik pokusu o reset hesla a porad totez. Aplimace totalne k nicemu, programatorum zlamat ruce at uz radeji nic nevymysli. | The App stops work. The current version is for Android 5.0 and higher only. I have 4.4. Please create the App for lower Android version. Thanks | The app doesn't load the vouchers tab, which is the only reason i installed it for, because i don't own a printer to print them (and wanted to save paper). I'm dissapointed... | Why can't I get my clubcard now , | It's not working at all | Aplikace najednou nelze aktualizovat. | Pěkný redesign, gratuluji vývojářům. | Nelze dokoncit registraci, píše neznámá chyba | Keeps asking to rate. Not very fast | Ospravedlňujem sa, moje review patrilo k druhej tesco aplikácii :) | Nemohu používat aplikaci, pokud mám root. Co s tím ? | Skvělý vývoj, je vidět, že aplikace pokročila | It's fine now, but the support must also speak English ;) | Po aktualizaci urcite prehlednejsi. Nektere carove kody se vubec neukazuji a misto dvojnásobku bodu mi naskocila sleva 6,- Kč na cely nakup za 2500,- takze carove kody nesedi. Vidím tom max. za 3 :-/ Update listopad 2019: Slevy v kuponech nefungují vubec. Zkusil jsem 3 kupóny. Každý hlásil nějakou nesmyslnou chybu. Akorát s tím zdrzujete všechny u pokladny a všichni ve frontě včetně obsluhy kasy jsou z toho otrávený. Appka na nic. | After latest update voucher topup issue fixed, but app still crashes upon the attempt to change contact preferences I.e. email address. | Aplikace nefunguje. Napřed nešla vůbec registrace mailu. Teď s odstupem času když se chci přihlásit, tak to chce naskenovat čìslo karty, datum a příjmení, ale pak to při potvrzení píše chybu. Prostě aplikace k ničemu | Login expires in two minutes, full of unexpected errors. Whats going on? | Unexpected error dokola a dokola, neuveritelne nepouzitelna aplikacia | I try to log in back. It does not allow me. It asks again the clubcard number.. i do not know which is the clubcard number..I am not able to log in back.. :( | Its very slow | Fingerprintbaby | Good | Average | Po aktualizaci aplikace nevidim sve kupony, ktere byly videt. Vyhlasi to neocekavanou chybu. Ze ja updatoval na novou verzi a nenechal si funkcni puvodni... A nelze zmenit jazyk appky. V english telefonu to nemuzu mit cesky... EDIT: diky za odpoved. V pristi aktualizaci prosim o moznost zmeny jazyka v nastaveni. | usefull app | App by mohla být přehlednější | fair, works as i expect | Strasne.. Po kazdom update cakam, ze to zacne konecne poriadne fungovat, ale furt to pri nacitani voucheru hlasi chyby, nahodne ma to nuti zadavat PIN aj ked som ho uz x-krat zadal... Oplatilo by sa investovat do testov. Toto nie su ziadne edge cases, ale uplne najzakladnejsi flow - otvorim appku a chcem vidiet kupony... | 👍 | Love it... Easy to use, easy the scroll through... | ok | this does not work! when i try to open a coupon or voucher it gives an errror. every time! | Great app for every Tesco customer. It offers everything needed for great clubcard experience | A+ | The app is not working properly. I can't download new coupons or vouchers although I've been notified more than once that I have new coupons. Also the app only works when connected to wifi if I'm on data bundle it crashes. | App often does not load the Vouchers tab. Also, it has happened to me that the vouchers were present in the app, but at the counter I was told that they are ""too new"" and ""not in the system"" and I was not able to pay with them. | Nemůžu načíst kupóny. Nejdřív to jen dělalo dlouho načítalo a pak to vzdalo a pokaždé hlásilo, že to nejde načíst. Největší ironie asi je, že mě to otravivalo s upozorněním, že tam mam nepoužité kupóny. Celá aplikace by si ale zasloužila velký redesign. | Píše to že mám rootnutej telefon a nejde ta aplikace (telefon nemám rootnutej) | Tesco obviously needs app developers. - Session expires issue - UI poor response - UX could be better | Spolehlive nefunkcni, hlavne kdyz stojite u pokladny .. zejmena prihlaseni do aplikace. Vseobecne je k nicemu ten system - proc se kupony neuplatnuji automaticky a zdrzujete nas s jejich hledanim a obsluhu s nacitanim??? Je tu snad nekdo, kdo kupony ma a nechce je uplatnit???!!! Pochybuju ... | Does not work with a rooted phone. | excellent app, keeps track of all the offers. | cannot register! have the message ""the data you entered do not match our system"" how is it possible???? | Good | Praštěná aplikace. Píše že mám root, nechce se pustit, přitom mám standardni Nokii s továrním androidem poslední verze. | Nekonečná stupidní smyčka přihlášení - uzivatel s emailem existuje -> pokus o reset hesla -> neplatný e-mail. Další e-mail společnosti davat nechci a tudíž musim odinstalovat, aniž bych si mohla vyzkoušet jeji kompletní nefunkčnost. :)) | Very friendly staff and I could buy all things I need here :) | Requiring signing in to see the benefits is too much. Previously it wasn't required. | amazing app, thanks tesco | popisky u voucheru jsou prilis male, jinak dobry | Pri registraci - pri zadani e-mailu(zkouseli jsme zadat asi 3) neustale pise, ze jiz existuje ucet s timto e-mailem. | Fingerprint sensor easily triggers ""pin was entered three times wrong"", app needs to be killed and restarted. Backlight issues. | Not working with root | Jak rootnotý telefon? Pardon, ale tohle je JEDINÁ aplikace, která detekuje nesmysl. Dost mne to dnes překvapilo. Protože vse dosud fungivalo, jak mělo. To nemáte jinou možnost jak prudit nepoctivce? Zas na to doplatí spousta poctivých lidi... Nesmyslné kroky, které odradí slušně zákazníky. Mám rád novinky, ale tohle je opravdu krok zpět. Zas mi začnete poukázky posilat poštou? O co tu vlastně jde? Začněte řešit problémy u samoobslužných pokladen a nefunkčnost scan&go. Místo, abyste lidem ušetřili cas, tak vše naprosto nesmyslně komplikujete. Náznak lepších zítřků se mění v zoufalství. Jsem poctivým zákazníkem a opravdu mi vadí, když mne někdo považuje za zloděje jakýmkoliv způsobem. Znám Tesco ze svých pobytů v UK a sorry, tohle by si tam nikdo nelajzl. Opravdu mne začínáte dost štvát svým přístupem... | Apka funguje dobře. Slevy nejsou tak velké, co jsem očekával. Ale jsem dokázal trochu ušetřit)) | Appka je ok, dela co ma. Dokonce mela driv biometricky login nez moje banka 😂. Mam tovarni rom . Dik | Do posledního updatu paráda, nebylo co vytknout. Teď mě aplikace nepustí dovnitř, prý že mám ""asi"" root na telefonu. To je výsměch. Mám na telefonu LineageOS, ale root nikoliv (což lze odlišit). Bankovní aplikace to umí, zajímalo by mě, proč vy ne. Díky. | NULA bodu za tu saskarnu se zakazem rootnutych zarizeni v posledni verzi. To je opravdu VELICE lamerske ""reseni"".  Edit po odpovedi od vyvojare: Vase copy & paste odpovedi jsou smesne. Zjevne neumite udelat veci PORADNE. Prodavat vsechny noze taky neni plosne zakazane jen proto, ze s NEKTERYMI JDE zabit cloveka. Je cas si priznat, ze vase ""reseni"" je amaterske a vic SKODI nez prospiva. Kdyz neco neumis delat poradne, radeji to nedelej vubec. A kdyz to potencialne postihne miliony lidi, tak tuplem.  Stranky itesco si s dovolenim strcte za klobouk, mobilni aplikace si lidi porizuji proto, aby NEMUSELI pouzivat nejake srandoidni stranky. A pouzivat je NECHTEJI a NEBUDOU. | Naprosto se ztotožnuji s předchozími hodnoceními. Kontrola rootu u aplikace tohoto druhu mi přijde absolutně nesmyslná. Bylo by lepší soustředit se na skutečné problémy této aplikace jako například komplikace se zřízením či propojením existujícího účtu a ne snižovat počet uživatelů skrze toto opatření. | Nefunguje. Nejde zapnout na telefonu s odemčeným bootloader. Mám vyzkoušeno 20 různých online banking aplikaci z různých zemí a žádné odemčeny bootloader nevadí, tak je absurdní aby aplikace s pár kuponky tohle řešila. | Nová verze se nespustí s odemčeným bootloaderem (ani root nemám). Boha jeho, jde o pár kupónů, ne přístup k bankovnímu účtu... | Logs me out after fingerprint authentication failure and for some reason requires clubcard number for login. Shouldn't email and password be enough? | Why has the setup so many steps? It is more complicated than setting up internet banking... The coupons that come via the app are difficult to use with the self-checkout, it always needs assistance of the attendant. Plus it always gives some errors and they are always helpless. Also, why am I getting the same via paper mail, when I obviously use the app? No wonder you are going bankrupt, this overly complicated loyalty stuff must cost you a fortune. | Vymysli hovadiny,ale apka nikdy nejela stabilne.To je výsměch zakaznikum. Na datech se často kopony nezobrazuji.Pak prijdu domů a vidím o co jsem přišel... už mě používání apky stalo minimalne 1000 bodů i peněz na nevyužitých slevách.   Přihlásit/odhlásit jsem udělal ještě na místě. Kupony jsem viděl bez obrázků na LTE a samotné kódy bez popisu jsou k ničemu. Nechápu, co mi na infolince řeknou víc a tak jediný, co budu řešit s nimi je leda tak vrácení na papírové kupony. Už jen to, že při přihlášení to chce kartu clubcard, tak ji musím nosit (kupony navíc už přežiju) a už nepotřebuju ani apku, se kterou jsem přes rok nespokojený i po všech aktualizacích. | It is a pity..few months and login still not working..product owner should really take care to make sure the app is working on android devices.. | Zaregistrovala jsem se jupii.. ALE pak pokaždé mi to pise log in kdyz se 
prihlasim pisne to congratulatoins u have nearly done it or whatever a pak 
se to nacita a sup jsem zpatky na kroku 1. Skenovat kartu po x krate se mi 
uz nechce.. takze se vlastně ani neprihlasim. | Is it possible to use this app in two different phones, please? Thank you for your help in advance. | Some days ago I got new coupons. Yesterday they disappeared. What have happened? Can you investigate and restore them? | O dost lepší. Použité kupóny se po použití automaticky mažou a aplikace  celkově svižnější. | Aplikace po aktualizaci mi vyrazila dech, vse jednoduse a prehledne, konec problem se zobrazenim nekterych kuponu. Skoda ze to tak neslo napoprve a update prisel po nekolika letech. | Tak uz to vypada, ze to vse funguje. Dnes jsem to zkousel..Diky moc | Better than the previous app but still a big big in the My points section : it does not display the accurate number | I must say I really like the new version (2.0.0). It can't even be compared to the previous one, as it's a complete rework and the user experience has improved greatly.  Pros: can be used offline, synchronizes automatically, one can easily swipe between coupons, both bar code and item description (and a picture) visible at once.  Cons: none I can think of. | OK. Na druhý pokus, cca po 4 letech, konečně aplikace, která funguje tj.čárový kód jde přečíst a zároveň se načtou aktuální slevy.  Takže konečně můžu tu otravnou kartičku a buzerpapíry vyhodit... Aktuálně(2017): konečně funkční synchronizace kuponů a informací. Ještě by to chtělo u zboží, zvláště pultovek zobrazovat v detailu štítky(složení) aby člověk nemusel spoléhat na blešky na toxickém(bisfenoly atd.) termo-papíru... | Super un-friendly to use. Actually the app is not necessary at all. When I shop just apply all the discounts automatically. Why do I have to apply some coupons individually. This sucks big time. Something that simole as discounts made super complicated. | Naprosto k ničemu, na pokladně mi řekli, že nedokáži kupon přijmout a že se omlouvají, ale nemůžou s tím nic dělat.. A že si ho mám vytisknout, takže k ničemu aplikace, samozřejmě, jak jinak, když je to Tesco. Opravdu jako vždy, celkově nefunkční obchod.... EDIT: Opakovaně jsem se pokusil použít kódy, bohužel opět nic nefungovalo, pouze číslo karty.. Ale to je na takovou aplikaci naprosto k ničemu.. | App is too complicated to use, have to individually download each coupon. Just to view the coupon code, you need to enter pin. To view another, you need to go back thru menu, can't just slide to another. In the shop, the codes do not scan from the screen so the cashier has to type them in. Since they are very long, you simply give up... pity, could have been cool... | Unable even to register. Do not recommend | Proč vůbec PIN?! Akorát to otravuje. Pro registraci pomocí účtu nakup.itesco.cz to chce jen rok i když to píše datum narození. | Aplikace je sice dobra,ze uz nemusim pouzivat papirove kupony,ale proc se pouzite poukazky nemazou samy nebo proc jsou kupony jen kopii tech papirovych,ktere nejde zvetsit a precist se daji jen s externi lupou (a to dost blbe)???Taky ovladani neni vubec intuitivni,u pokladny nejdrive chteji club kartu (radsi pouzivam z VISA Portmonky) a pak teprve poukazky a kupony,aplikace zdrzuje nejen me,ale i lidi ve fronte za mnou.Takze by to chtelo predelat celou apku,aby byla uzivatelsky prijemna.Diky | Pět minut do toho naťukávám údaje pro registraci a pak mi to řekne ""Podrobnosti, které jste zadali, přesně neodpovídají těm v našem systému"". ??? | U pokladny není vždy snadné rychle přepnout z clubcard do kupónu. (Cesta není vždy intuitivní.) Seznam obchodů pak ukazuje pouze Prahu, a to i na mapě. | Zkuste nastavit zobrazení horizontálně a zvyšovat jas na maximum | Po hodine pokusu se prihlasit kdyz na webu se normalne prihlasim jsem to vzdal a odinstaloval | Nová verze chce přístup k identity informacím. | Neakceptuje to moje prijmeni a Datum na 4 je rok, den a mesic DDMM, MMDD, to zas delat Itak :-D | Prihlásenie je komplikované a aplikácia si nezapamätá prístupové údaje, čiže ich treba zadávať zas a znova. Bez prístupu k netu sa navyše neprihlásite vôbec. Tým pádom je apka prakticky nepoužiteľná aj keď inak potenciál má. | Tesco, k čemu je ta aplikace? | Dobrá","{""1"":2168,""2"":533,""3"":1590,""4"":4664,""5"":24111}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Tesco Stores","Tesco+Stores","info@itesco.cz","http://itesco.cz",,"https://itesco.cz/ochrana-osobnich-udaju/","Tesco+Stores","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FOXIFjq8F9sAPLiVJClR_i8kvgZ76nuHyRcUEY47k5AZTq0KmMTslcHH_KEFDdkX1Qw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IlHBxotLZp7n5UBsrias7fvBzacwQ1W4l9YsAjyZ-oGqTK2XVkToVzyShdUW_g0CxrU","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DBLK78JXNo0-kMp-mLMDAgg99yRfcDukBdCtgRQxMXi7QWkJN-4mVkHcTA9gFltbzgE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7uuZuh1S9V3GUcbSFG26PUaku2MLd6y1mDKfMou38nrxtKTkffuXeTM13xXIS51lOM0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qnOIYC9GgtiHfKtGHPu4atDO3h6nyJXmArUwhwwHGoRqFdzZQiP1kpl-QB0PyYeLjow5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ny-ZOPcYC8bYK3mTJqXrK6OLaGiKzN3TfTNYyB39JpqHUgW4PPI47C9AeY2qxOW0WYer"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s4UYk1z06F6g-ymEV--4LogbNlPT7UDZdWxLmRxz-Sp5xsrjsDEb-6SKPsQKF02YypLE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PGhq1wZrkRUjMeITsEFdzBBT8TKoK3wRAnHUketAl9Pvv3N121Ax95Wz4uv614th-Q""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,true,"May 29, 2015",1710169836000,"4.10.0","This update is focused just on bug fixing to provide you smooth and easy access to all your Clubcard benefits.","[""This company and their app is a joke.

Way more than convenient to have all options in one app | محترم وعلى درجة عالية من الذوق | Good helping alot | very good timing | bolt is reliable and trustworthy..I using bolt | Drivers are harrassing the customers. | best wishes | he was an amazing driver | It's affordable | Bolt driver are really scammers.. this guy cheat me with over 14 cedis.. | Great service | The worst Customer service !!! Be verry careful as the driver can cancel your order to get 6€ without driving you anywhere even he see you walking to his car. Then the Customer support will do nothing , even they will answer you 1-2 days after saying that you must walk faster next time ..... never have that problems with UBER ever. So my advice is avoid Bolt !!!! | I've just gotten ride of this App , bunch of scammers! How can my ride go from 23 to 32 and 17 to 28 when there was no traffic? neither did we stop on the way . Scamming people without notice Una dey mad | It is quite convince. | This is sucking business!! Charged money when driver came to pickup and cancelled trip himself. There should be no ride no charge policy!!! | good | nice driver | Good | good driver | best drive ever | is pretty good 👍 | Good | Good | takes a while to open a few times but overall an outstanding app | drivers are always on time and they are friendly | Nice app! | don't have any complain nor problem wth this app | cool ride and nice driver | Nice | it's easy but sometimes bolt changes the price | 💯 | So far I have no complaints about using Bolt.

So can't get past the initial screen when trying to sign up. | فعلا که خوب بوده | အရမ်း​ကောင်း | cool guy,very friendly | Nice ride | it's good | It's a good app but many times drive are forcing us to cancel the ride after a pickup and surprisingly they will cancel or you will cancel the ride or they might tell you to suggest a nearby place, but still they will take you at the right destination, what happened here it's what if it happens that they take you to a wrong direction after they have cancelled your ride and they have already picked you up | excellent ride | Our driver arrived quickly when another app couldn't find us a driver. | Ușor de folosit, de regulă se găsesc mașini. | Please add google pay support! | driver always ask to go off line and dey charge you more than what you are meant to pay and it's very bad and still end up robbing you of all your things and valueable | excellent service | Good | good driver | Love Bolt!!! | very good | RESPECT | great | The driver is very friendly | Good prices and for my location there alot of bolts available.

Yet as soon as you book they all vanish. | he charged me the money tha was not on the app, he said after 8pm its R50 | Hardly have any drivers and when they accept they always cancel.

Your feedback helps us improve.","[""Sometimes Bolt app substitutes the name of a well-known location (eg Main Railway Station) with a wrong address that is not even visible in the app. So you end up being dropped somewhere around but not at the entrance to a building as expected. But they don't want to fix it, advising instead to check pin on the map, tell the driver where exactly you need to go etc. Taking additional steps on a user side doesn't improve user experience. Especially disappointing as before it worked normally."",""App itself is great, but the drivers are generally quite bad. Breaking rules, dirty cars, I always see a Bolt driver breaking traffic or parking rules every time I walk the streets in my neighborhood. Too many instances to keep reporting this, it is a general problem caused by the pressure to offer a low price. Use a different app if you can, drivers of other services have to be certified taxi drivers and it makes a big difference."",""Ok for finding rides, but really scammy approach when it comes for ride price sometimes. Imagine you take a ride, it all goes well, no traffic, the driver took the best road, and you arrived safely. In the end, you can be charged 2x more because \""there was a surge in demand while you were on the way, so we will charge you extra more after you confirmed your initial price\"". Also doesn't give a hint that there might be extra charges for toll/airport/etc. Also lacks \""reserve a ride\"" feature."",""After seeing the ride shown as £5.30 on Google Maps, I gave it a go. I installed the app and handed over my personal details, I checked the ride cost and it was £8.30. I feel duped by Bolt and Google Maps. Update: I checked the app 20 minutes later and saw the price dropped to £5.60. The app required you pay the amount before searching for a driver. No drivers were nearby or accepted the ride. After waiting 5 mins, I cancelled and went with Uber who charged £6.98 but had lots of cars available."",""I have suggestions. Have in mind that I use Bolt 2-wheels on a daily basis. 1 - There is no way to extend or renew a pass. I buy the monthly pass and I have to either wait the days to pass or consume 100% of my pass balance to then buy a new one. 2 - 99% of the time the app crashes when I hit END RIDE button. I always have to close the app and reopen it to end my ride. 3 - The menu doesn't always show the button for Scooter and e-bike pass, I have to turn on the GPS and Data in order to see it.""]",false,false,false,"ee.mtakso.client","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.mtakso.client&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Then, for videos, they are not full screen, are always muted and I have to hit play twice to get them to work. A 10 second reel takes me 30 seconds to open.

It was a pleasure. | Common, cart is not synced between devices? Please, this is the basic functionality of any shopping app, FIX that or IMPLEMENT it. | Great | Aplicatia este usor de folosit. Se poate imbunatati la selectarea categoriilor pe care sa le vizionezi. Nu este foarte intuitiva optiunea asta. | Can't order for months on this app! I always get the error ""invalid city"" thrown when trying to order, so I have to use a desktop. App useful just for wishlisting. Fix your bugs! | moda i zakupy online | Ок | Good app, easy to use | Great | My favorite app.I am a big fan.Always the nicest things,best prices, very good quality,nice colours.You can pick up from store and return it if it doesn't fit.99% measures are good.Love it.!!!!?? | Very easy and user friendly. | Easy | Cool | bez greske | Sup | Even if I ordered the products by using the app, when I wanted to make the return process, I had to do it on the web. It is quite annoying for a simple customer and also, the customer support was not so user friendly and did not want to understand the client's situation even if... SINSAY's core business consists in sales... Online or directly into the shop... Integrate your interfaces and provide some soft skills trainings to your employees to make a smoother process. | 👍 | Iubesc calitatea hainelor. | Good app, easy to find products and buy. | С приложението се работи лесно и бързо. | Kox | Great experience so far..ordered already few times without any problem | A little difficult to find something, online there are more possibilities | Convenient app | App is alright in itself, but constant updates are just unacceptable. | 1. Доставка уже почти неделю, хотя было заявлено 3/4 рабочих дня 2. Заказ на сумму больше 140 злотых и все равно доставка платная, хотя они пишут в условиях что бесплатно | It was really nice | Thank you for your professionalism! | Can't register. After registration from the site and finally sucsessfully login in the app, the app logged me in, but then forced me to agree with some policy. I try to agreed with it, but the app tells me that there is some error, nothing special. Maybe the app should show the real problem to the end user like ""The app is not working for now, we are hard working to back it."" or something simmilar. In result I wasnt able to use the discount in the my local store. Thus app is something like scam! | User friendly | Mi-ar placea sa pot filtra mai usor. Din pacate, spre exemplu, categoria de sport nu era asa vizibila. In rest am comandat usor. Chiar ma bucur sa o folosesc. | Bezpłatna dostawa do sklepu, ale ŻADEN sklep w Warszawie (!!) nie realizuje tymczasowo dostaw ze sklepu online od kilku miesięcy. Gorące pozdrowienia dla rekinów marketingu Sinsay 👏 | Nice ideas and quality best prices very fast delivery ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🙏💛 | Satisfying | Good app. Easy to do your shopping. User friendly. | I love it. | Tabelul de marimi este prost facut,si nu te poti baza pe el. | Magyar felületen lengyel oldal jelenik meg. | Voljela bih vidjeti wishlist i u online stranici, a ne samo u aplikaciji jer oboje koristim ovisno jesam li na mobitelu ili laptopu. | Great | The worst! First they have modified my delivery address, then they discovered that they don't have any item on the stock. Unreliable! | great | Szybkie i wygodne zakupy, super, że jest dostęp do składu | My partner and I order clothes from Sinsay and so do I for our 2 kids. Ratio between quality and price is great recommend the app. | Perfect | Buzeranti | Grate clothes | Nice promotions | Poor search engine | Ako se odabere preuzimanje narudžbe u poslovnici, može se odabrati samo nekoliko poslovnica, a kad naručite na adresu, GLSu ne plate uslugu i onda paket stoji danima u skladištu, ne dobijete obavijest, nego tek kad ih pitate. Paket se vrati, a novce ne vraćaju dok ne dobiju paket natrag? Jedno je kad sami tražite povrat, pa okej, ali ovako kad je greška s njihove strane...katastrofa. Podrška odgovara svaka 3 dana, UX nula bodova | It doesn't work, doesn't allow me to finish the order | Imi place mult interfata online | Ok quality, good deals! | 🤩 | Pana acum sunt multumita | Sve uredno prikazano i kupnja i povrati.

Не мога да си попълня информацията, като се опитам да я запазя не се случва нищо, изключително бавно е. | Just as previously stated by someone else, I have had the same problem for a few months now: I cannot pay for orders placed via the app. Right at the end, after following all the necessary steps, without any difficulty, I should add, when I press pay, it gives me error. I have notified Sinsay about this. Now, let's see what they are going to do about it. And telling me to order via Google Chrome is not the solution, sorry. | Gunoi de app. Nu poti plati, se schimba preturiile cand pui in cos si merge foarte greu. | Great | Brilliant | Ati putea adauga o secțiune de review-uri. | Îmi place! | i love shopping | Discountul oferit la instalarea aplicației nu exista | Great app with great stuff in it. | Ușor de folosit, rapidă, practică | Very good | Лесно за употреба | I cant place an order , it keeps telling me to fill in my information even thou I did , over and over again! | Ok | Aplicatia asta nu e facuta cum trebuie. Cand trebuie sa platesti si ai datele de facturare si livrare deja selectate, la plata cu cardul da eroare. Nu mai laudati aplicatia asta ca adaugi in cos si nu poti plati la final. Prefer sa cumpar din browser decat din aplicatie. Nu recomand! | Самото приложение насича доста честно. Липсва детайлно меню за под-категории като в на сайта, тук са само генерални за мъже/жени/деца. Също не всичко от сайта излиза на Търсене в приложението. | Nem enged budapesti üzletet kiválasztani a boltban átvételhez... Tehát teljesen haszontalan átverés az ország nagyrésze számára | Super | Good | Probleme la plata. Desi aveam profilul pt destinatar si cel pt facturare create deja, imi tot cerea sa completez toate datele. La iesirea din cos am pierdut toate cumpărăturile. Am reusit abia dupa logare din nou sa imi adun articolele dorite in cos si sa fac tranzacția. | I cannot see the details of any of the products as it's just a black page when I click on them. | Csak arra nem alkalmas amire való (lenne) Rendelni nem lehet. | De calitate produsele | Totul foarte clar si usor de utilizat.

I wasn't able to place the order and I gave up. | Katastrofa Sorry ale spíš vůbec nic, než takhle nedodělaná appka.. Upd: 0 reakce | Aplicatia abia se incarca, stai si astepti o gramada dupa ce selectezi optiunile tale. Daca ai treaba si revii dupa sa mai cauti ceva se reseteaza tot. O pierdere de timp. Plus ca la ultima comanda produsele mi-au venit cu defecte si rupte. | este aplicatia mea favorita pentru shopping! toate produsele sunt extrem de minunate! 💕💕💕 | The app works amazing. Very easy to use. | Super totul | Works well for me | ok | Easy to use. | The worst shopping experience ever. Hire proffesional who can create a decent app. Hire some QAs to test it! It crashes in all kinds of places. It's embarrassing! | Ok | Unable to pay via app! Easy product search and overall navigation through the app but I cannot seem to be able to pay for my orders via the app. Both Google Pay an credit card options fail and I need to revert to the website to finalize the process. Is there a setting I am missing? I am using an android phone, no similar issues with other online shopping apps | Awesome! | This appos the drim! | Good | Najnowsza wersja zawiera poprawki? W którą stronę?Nie dość, że ciągle wyrzuca mnie z apki, najczęściej podczas wybierania rozmiaru danej rzeczy z poziomu listy ulubionych czy wybieraniu paczkomatu lub punktu odbioru. Przez to mnóstwo razy ktoś podkupił mi rzeczy, które ciągle sprawdzałam czy są dostępne. Na dodatek nie da się znaleźć paczkomatu lub sklepu gdy wpisuje miejscowość, nie wyszukuje mi jej. Jedyne, co mogę zrobić, to szukać jej na mapie całej Polski,przybliżając w orientacyjne miejsce | On the website I use Facebook login, in the app I don't have an option to use FB login to use the same account... and the user and pass does not work in normal login... | I cannot be used for more then 5 minutes. This app is bed | Super ok | Awesome 👍👍👍👍 | Prefer magazinul online. Aplicatia este buguita. Nu imi arata produsele si nu are o baza de date comuna cu websiteul asa ca ma spameaza dublu cu emailuri. | It worked smooth until couple of weeks ago. Now I can't even use the app anymore, since the products pages don't load completely and cannot see the respective pictures and details/sizes. Reloading page doesn't help. It's just very frustrating. Am I the only one who's experiencing this issue? What is the fix for it? | I have an account created with Facebook on the web version, but the app does not have the option to login with Facebook so I can't use my existent account and I don't want to create another one! Please fix this. I am uninstalling until then... | Very good app 😍🙂I love there's an option to search for a product's label | Works great . | Nice app for kids clothes | Sinsay has great clothing collections and I have ordered multiple times until now that the web version doesn't work properly, it is such a hassle to even login. And the app cannot be translated to English, it is not easy to navigate when you don't understand the language. Looking forward to new language features. | The app is closing by it self | Excelenta! | I downloaded the app and all was ok until payment - I could not pay online or place the order with payment on delivery either because I kept getting the same message: ""sorry, there was an error"". So I had to place the order again on my computer. The app seems useless for now. | Cannot order from the app. Error at the last step. It works on the website. Nu se poate comanda din aplicatie. Apare eroare la ultimul pas. Functioneaza de pe site. | very slow, throws random errors (like a connection error when I typed a wrong password and the same error when I typed the right password) | The App looks good but then again how do I use it when I do not understand the language. Because you live in a country doesn't mean you speak their language. My point is that there should be somewhere on that App where one can change the language irrespective of the country | Nu se poate finaliza plata. Am incercat conturi diferite,dispozitive diferite, plata cu card,google pay,plata la livrare si tot fara rost. Am incercat si de pe site dar cu acelasi rezultat. Dupa 24 ore am reusit sa platesc cu Google Pay (Am aplicatia instalata). In continuare nu se poate alege plata cu card.Nu apare nici o eroare ,doar te intoarce la pagina finalizare comanda.

Danke. | in this new app, where can i see how many points i have? in old version it was better... | So beautiful | DM Sortiment und Qualität gewohnt super, die App hat nützliche Funktionen, reagiert aber extrem träge auch auf aktueller und performanter Hardware. Review 04.02.2023: Seit dem letzten Update deutlich schneller! Danke Entwicklerteam! Review 17.03.2024: Die App ist zwischenzeitig wieder gtottenlahm geworden 😐 | Here in Serbia, you don't get any perks for having the app. A cashier won't even scan because their system is not connected with the app. Im Serbien sind wir kein Mensch? | хора, толкова ви е бъгаво приложението, че на логин още умира... оправете го първо, после го качвайте... | Cannot see any products in the Products tab. | Very beautiful app. I have my shopping under control. | No Romanian version, why? | Some of the products don't appear in the purchase history, therefore I cannot collect points for buying them. | Sehr gut | Sjajni DM | Dobar | All I ever wanted is an ""Activate all"" button for the cupons. I hate activating 30 one by one. | Hallo, application is excellent, BUT, I wonder why I don't have any coupon in application in Serbia. Never?. | Adorr | The best Thing in my opinion about dm is that you can easily check if your desired items are in stock. Everything about dm is costumerfriendly. | The old app has been phased out without a single notification. I had to create new account, so I lost my previous points (edit: I have the points but need to further steps and find the menu point to do it on the main screen... This should be part of the workflow when I create new account if you don't want to maintain an old one...). When I was registered to the app, my brand new password was not matching, so I had to request a new immediately... | Ova aplikacija je beskorisna, sve ima na sajtu. Srpski menadžeri neće da se potrude i osmisle nešto u Srbiji, za razliku od hrvacke i ostalih zemalja gde aplikacija ima smisla. | Muller ima tole bolj enostavno. Tukaj pa dodatno prodajalka naredi kartico, pa zadeva ne deluje. Vpisovala naslov tudi na njenem telefonu in javlja napako. Ne razumem zakaj toliko kompliciranja. Naložite si Mullerjo aplikacijo in deluje simpl. Že prej s tistimi ""bankomati"" ni šlo vse kot je treba. Unistalled | sehr gut | amazin | Odlična usluga, kvalitet extra. | Aplikaciji nedostaju filteri po preferencijama tipa Vegan, organic. Takodje imam problem da dobijam error kada pokušam da napravim korpu gde dobijam poruku da su neke cene promenjene i da proverim sadržaj korpe. Pritom app ne nudi rešenje. Morala sam da obrišem celu korpu i ponovo ubacim čitav sadržaj. Dodatno, app radi sporo kada se artikli izbacuju iz korpe ili kada se ubacuju iz wish liste. | Bugggzzz, tokom instaliranja, poslije tri ponovnog pokretanja, app. stabilan | Najzad. A tako dugo sam s epitala zašto nemaju app. Ravim | Yet another App that fails to recognise people don't necessarily speak the language of the country in which they live or work ...DOES NOT SUPPORT ENGLISH | I don't know why you developed this, just to show us it does not work. Each time I am in a store, the QR code cannot be scanned because their system is not functional. | Great | Aplikacija za srpsko tržište je beskorisna... Ne pruža nikakve pogodnosti, lojaliti ne postoji. 👎 | This is total spyware! | Too many updates, whenever I want to use the app in the shop it always asks for some update and you can't use your loyalty card without updating. This is really annoying because even if I update it, I have to log in again. It takes too much time which you don't have when you're at the paydesk. | Are all 253 updates every year really necessary...!? Almost every time when opening the app at the cash desk to show a QR and collect the points, the app needs an update. This has become really, really annoying to the point of unusability! Not worth the effort... 🙄 | Fali dark mode | Ovoj aplikaciji fali jednostavnost. Payback mi je bila bolja. Jedina prednost je webshop. | Absolutely bad tested application. First of all you can't log in on Xiaomi phone if you default browser is Google chrome. When you log in in mii browser and try to bind a loyalty card and forgot the pin you can't change it - error message tells that all fields have to be filled but they are already filled. Next, when I change pin why should I fill in my birthdate, post code and fill in again the whole card number? Please hire someone who can make applications. | 1. In den Coupons gibt es leider keine Direktlinks zu den betroffenen Produkten, sodass man diese erst über die Suche finden muss. Das macht die Konkurrenz schon lange. 2. Neuerdings werden nicht mehr die zuerst ablaufenden Coupons verwendet, falls man mehrere fast identische (abgesehen vom Ablaufdatum) hat. Sehr ärgerlich. 3. Bereits aktivierte Coupons kann man nicht mehr deaktivieren. Spontane Einkäufe mache ich bei der Konkurrenz, damit mir der jeweilige Coupon für den Großeinkauf bleibt. | Sehr gut | Its nice app.But,i cant find active beauty,and i didnt get any cupons,only first when i install the app. | All good | tooop | bad very bad 👎 it takes too long and it doesn't work | Super | Влизам в личния си профил, пиша ревю, всеки път трябва да пиша псевдоним, полето е задължително и никога не мога да си напиша името, защото ""вече е заето""?? Естествено, че е заето, нали това съм аз! Що за глупост?? | No English version | Checkout does not work. The user can only see the following message:""We are sorry... Unfortunately, this page does not exist."". I have installed the latest app version. This functionality was working fine before. | top | I like to shop there | Great 👍 | It's annoying that I need to sign in EVERY TIME I want to use the app. I think there are not too many coupons | Pola stvari skoro nikad nije dostupno online. Ne odgovaraju na poruke. | Super | super | Functioneaza super ok. | Can you please make the app available in English? I live in Hungary and It would be nice to have it available in english too! | sometimes app doesn't work | 1. Koliko vidim aplikacija nema opciju ""Preuzmi u radnji"". 2. Naravno, 15% na prvu kupovinu se odnosi SAMO na ONLINE prvu kupovinu ali to nigde nije naglašeno. 3. Čudno je da je ovako jaka firma tek sada uvela ovakvu vrstu aplikacije kada je i mnogo lošije firme imaju već nekoliko godina... ili je u pitanju odnos prema potrošačima u Srbiji... | Aplikacija je super, paket je spakovan fenomenalno, sve je zasticeno maksimalno, sve pohvale🥰 | odlična lagana sve vidčjivo | I ordered for the first time through the application, in order to receive a 15% discount for the first purchase. As the items broke during delivery, they refunded my money within 4 days. I asked them to deliver the products to me, but not to return the money, they said they couldn't do that. Yes, I also lost the 15% discount, as if I had received the products. I have ordered the products I really enjoy to use so my disappointment was huge. Customer care failed completely. #dmSerbia | Loveee | Am very much interested please for us to do business with DM company | I'd like to see my purchase receipts in digital form. There's no such option in the app or at least I couldn't find it. | Where can I see my points? I don't have my points which I gathered for 10 years. I just cut these useless card. Goodbye. Hello rossmann | No english language | Odlično! | Katastrofa!!! Poradite malo na marketingu, ako želite da poklonite nešto potrošaču za online kupovinu, neka to budu pravi popusti ili besplatna dostava za bilo koji iznos kupovine. Razočarenje. P. S. Danas je broj 26 prazan, piše da je već bio otvoren.... | Worst application ever. You can't buy anything because they say it is not available when you go to checkout but you are able to add it to cart. | It's niceeeeeee | best. | The application helps in sorting out new products, discounts and shops in which you can find the last, remaining items. It is also rewarding because you can pay your shopping with the collected points. | Great store, great products and prices, great application | The app is good but EVERYTHING else is a NIGHTMARE.In app it writes that delivery is 2-3 working days,I made order 30.11.2023,after 5 days it comes messeage that order it will be delivered,unfortunately I was not available to accept the order from DPD.I reorder the delivery date to another day 12.12.2023,DPD support say that order is not ready that day and it goes tommorow 13.12.2023,the same package is not delivered on time 3 times in a row. Horrible delivery experience here in Croatia. | There is no English language. How are we supposed to understand the app? The developer forgot that there are other nationalities who would like to use the app. | I love DM because the prices are good and I can order online so fast and easy, either with delivery at home or for pickup in a shop. I'm already buying most of the stuff I need from here because it's just cheaper than in other places and also Bio quality. I just hope they increase their assortment of goods so I can get everything here. If they keep their prices lower than other providers, I'm definitely staying their client for life. | Velmi dobre | hilft | perfect 💖💞💖💦 | Had to spend 10 minutes getting a new QR code in the app (apparently they expire after a while) but it worked perfectly a week prior. Constantly getting errors and of course I couldn't get my points either for a bigger purchase I had. Would not recommend this app unless you have ample time on your hands. | Funktioniert sehr gut! Много добро приложение! | Very unfriendly, very and unnecessary complicated integration with dm active beauty account | Uzas uzas i uzas, porudzbinu cekate po 10 dana ali to nije do aplikacije... Ukoliko Vam nesto tteba hitno ne narucivati! | With update not possible to log in again, bonus points lost | The app is decent but everything else is not. The package packed by DM was horrible. They just showed stuff together, pet food&hygiene on top of each other. Liquid soap bursted and soaked half of the stuff. I've spent over an hour cleaning my hallway from the mess and their customer service says ""just pack it good and return it"" 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ horrible service and experience, never buying over app with them! | Ich liebs vorallem die Coupons sind einfach super | It's such an excellent app! So easy to use and have all the info within few clicks. Bravo!!! | gooda gooda là same same but different mr là! | es wäre super wenn man die Coupons nutzen könnte ohne sich zu registrieren | Useless - given that DM requires also ownership of plastic card | sehr gut | Very interesting and useful app, especially concerning information related to products and stores where to purchase them | Brilliant best way to save a lot of money❤️ | Magic | top | app not available in French on English | The app is great, even better now than it was in the beginning.

Jenom aby mi pani rekla, ze to v obchode nefunguje a potrebuju plastovou kartu. Mam si ji pry sparovat s aplikaci. Akorat ze sparovat to nikde nejde. Takze jako co? DM Praha Strasnice dnes. | Leider wird mittlerweile erwartet ein Payback Konto zu hinterlassen, um die Coupons nutzen zu können. Dadurch wird die App für mich allerdings nutzlos, da ich kein Payback Kunde bin | Very good app. It would be even better if we had the option of deactivating coupons when needed. Thanks | За съжаление поръчката ми дойде с липсващи продукти, а на оплакването ми не получих отговор | sehr gut | Good very good | Predobra app, mnogo mi se svida | Gute | Worst app I ever seen | Ocajno napravljeno. Cekas paket dugo i kad konacno dobijes obavestenje da ce danas stici paket i pise navodno koliko sati uopste nije tako. Ne znas ukoliko sati ce doci!! I onda kad se desi da se slucajno nejavis na telefon oni ne zele opet dolaziti nazad vec sutra dan. I sad ti sutra treba da cekas ceo dan sa telefonom u ruci ko budala ne znajuci u koliko sati ce doci!! Napravite redovno tu sugavu aplikaciju stavite pratnju preko putem Gps !! Ali da ovo je Srbija vi to nikada necete imati! .!. | Dobra aplikacija. Lako i jednostavno bez bagova, lagova. Pozitivno iskustvo i preporuke! | so many bugs | Captcha goes on forever till I die when I try to sign in | poor filters. | I would appreciate if it was possible to skip update for later as I just needed the clerk scan my card at the checkout. | 💖 | Ne da se povezati z Payback aplikacijo. | Много съм разочарована! Още първата ми поръчка беше объркана. Няма да използвам повече. | This is such a nice app! I actually love buying products from DM and using their app. Also,if you don't wanna wait too long you can actually pick up your products at the DM store! Only negative thing is that the limiteds are not available later,but eitherway,it's a good app! I recommend this app for DM lovers! Yours truly,hcney. | 👍 | 👍 | Does have unusable functions. | 👌👌👌👌 | velmi dobra appka ! | Pécsen a szolgáltatás kiszállítás miatt hasznàlhatatlan.

Elmegyek a Rossmanba és törlöm az alkalmazást. | It would be nice if I had a chance to put together a shopping list, and check everything when I buy it. I think it would be a nice feature. | Complicated and not user frendly | ❤️ | I used ""ridicare express"" - before, and I could pay with cash, when, I went after my already packaged goods - from your store. - since, your application has benefits like 15% off - At my chosen store, they cannot read my loyalty card-they couldn't from the start, since they can't use the reader of said QR code - numar client. How am I supposed to get the products you sell, if I get cash into my hands every month, and I used to be able to use said money? Are you above that I should get 15% off? | Perfect | Super zadovoljna. | Unreliable, useless app. Keeps logging me out, forgets the connected physical card. The worst shopping app I ever tried. | Sehr gute Deals! | Ich bin zufrieden | It keeps logging out... | Nisam dobio aktivacioni mejl ni posle nedelju dana pokušavanja da mi se ponovo pošalje, čak sam i slao mejl direktno dm-u !?! Didn't get the activation mail, even after 1 week of trying to resend one, I even sent mail directly to dm Srbija !?! | Nepregledna i komplicirana aplikacija. | Doresc de 2 luni sa fac o comanda mare online.As beneficia de livrare gratuita si de voucherul online de 15 la suta. Cred ca nu mai cumpar ever de la DM. Va bateti joc de oameni. Jumatate din produsele din lista pentru comanda lipsesc de pe stoc. Cand lipsesc unele,cand altele. Si majoritatea sunt marci DM, deci nu se poate da vina pe alti furnizori. Mereu nu sunt produsele. Ce mai puneti livrare online daca aveti in depozite 3 lulele 3 surcele mereu? Halal fidelitate! Vrea omul, dar nu are ce. | The payment didn't go through twice in the row, items that I've ordered stayed in the basket. It worked in the browser afterwards. | sometimes to allow it the cart has many items | App not working properly, it kept kicking me out every time I wanted to proceed with payment. Their customer service is extremely slow in responding to emails.

If you can't find thing on product search go for web search well if you can read and know how to use app. 4 stars because for some plastic wrapped things it shows boxed ones. Great app keep it up.

I scanned the barcode on the computer.I was amazed it instantly linked my cell onto the laptop. Awesome, ser-friendly.

Luckily my bank flagged the transaction as suspicious and suspended my card. I have since had other communications via email about a free trial and monthly subscriptions luckily also stopped.

Great for planning trips with the option to save them if you have a Seznam email. You can download maps and find your way even offline. Provides useful information about various points of interest, from caves through ruins to weirs. | Uzitocna, podrobna mapa! | 2016Přivítal bych možnost využití rozlišení telefonu. 2024 Nyní mám tel S23 a stále mám pocit, že by bylo super možnost zobrazit více informací v jednom pohledu. Rozumím že každý nemá skvělý zrak, ale kdyby to šlo nastavit, tak by to bylo super. Jinak třeba v Nepálu se podle těchto map dalo chodit bez problemu. Takže skvělé. | Excelente | Whats gone wrong? Maps will no longer show correctly since last update. | Excellent navigation app. Its getting better and better ! I love the GUI, it is designed as I would make it and its even better. Gongratulations to the app team 👌 | Great map & navigating app | no street view | Version 9.46.0 keeps GPS permanently on and drains battery. | We have used this app for hiking in the mountains, mostly in the Canary Islands. It has been excellent and allowed us to experience and plan so much more with greater confidence. Gareth D. UK | The best maps out there, and they are free. I've had a few hiccups whilst out cycling. The voice navigation sometimes tells me to take the first right. When I do,it asks me to turn back. I will one day figure out why it does that, and post it here. In the meantime it's still an exceedingly good application. | I rate it 3* because of the potential the app has. The maps are decent, the offline works, I like most the altitude and the weather factor in route estimation. Lots of good things about the app but the registration process is terrible and I gave up registering. They require an SMS to be sent to an international number, which is blocked by many North American carriers. The app developers either don't know this or they don't care, otherwise they would remove the SMS registration immediately. | The best maps I've ever used! Love to cycling with this app. | Good and it's free! I will give 5 stars if have all the gravel bike trails, bike lanes, and more options of how to custom bike routes such as easy ride and avoid busy traffic roads. Plus need to have more options of choosing different types of bicycle such as gravel, touring, etc. It will be really nice and to use when planning routes just be able to draw right on the road not Markers. Please add this features in future updates thank you! Kudos to the developers, you are awesome! Thank you!👍🏼 | Great app for navigation, unfortunately it now appears to be impossible to be able to create an account due to sms verification failure!! | Lately it's slow and constantly falling down, almost every time I open it. It's impossible to use it and rely on it! It's impossible to plan a long distance trail, crashes down constantly. Nothing what it used to be. | The best app-map for any kind of travelling, especially outdoors. Unmatched level of detail and reliability+ offline maps function. | Best, has everything | Wonderful to have all the footpaths in the whole of Europe at my fingertips. Used it extensively in Spain and found it very useful. | Excellent app for navigation but let down by the terrible cartography (change map options). Eg on the outdoor map footpaths are hard to distinguish from roads at high zoom. While for towns the Openstreetmap default is far more useful. | Works well. Offline mode is very useful | Great so far but impossible to set up account | Best map ever, so easy to read, like in 2 seconds you can see main roads, sight seeing things, shops... just love this map. And so good for hiking, walking around and cycling. | Best tourist app out there! Most comprehensive information on existing marked and unmarked hiking & biking trails I have seen anywhere. | Great app! Has maps everywhere, including Nepal, Europe and more (I guess) which is amazing! The only place I feel for improvement is in signing up and signing i ln, good work | The maps are accurate and up to date, app works fast. I love it. | Very easy to use and download maps | Aplikace je fajn. Graficky asi nejlepsi, ale ovladani je tak 5-10 let zpet, chaoticky se zobrazuji a skryvaji funkce,POIky se nedaji importovat a tezko se s nimi funguje v mape.Offline mapy v cizine jsou schopny vyzrat datovy tarif, chybi vypnuti dat WTF? | best maps of all | Never saw a registration process that requires the user to send an SMS to a number in a different country. Unable to create an account because of that. Uninstalling. | Very accurate for Camino | First time using it and very impressed. Hesitated giving5 stars as the altitude/ascent is way out after a few days hiking, but that could be due to offline mode. But what makes up for that s when you pause tracking and even close the app it always resumes. A lot of other mapping apps do not. | V rámci Česka rozhodně přesnější, než např. Google Mapy | The best | Good app for routes. Only show more time than it's needed for routes. But other is great. | OSM and fast UI. That's all I need. | Easy and best Map for Europe...👍 | Excelent | Od kilku lat korzystam z mapy.cz i jestem bardzo zadowolony. Częste aktualizacje, dokładne dane, świetna nawigacja offline. POLECAM | Best map application for Czechia, period. | Used to be better. Now on Android 12 not updating my points correctly, have to reinstall the app periodicaly. And to verify the account you almost need to be a brother of the app developer, lol. | It just works, if tou ever go to Czechia download this. It works best for Czechia and you get all the info you need. 10/10 | It won't even open after last update. Pls fix. | Perfect map app. | Tmavý režim prosím! | Great maps of hiking trails in Croatia and Slovenia. Offline maps very useful option. | My go to for all map related things! | The best offline app | The maps are great to look at, and it's free, but after using mapy, I have realized that there are a lot issues with it. Issues as follows: -There is no live traffic when using it for driving in the UK. -Difficult to search for places unless you know the full address. -There is no hill shading when using it offline for hiking. -Difficult to use the route planner -Cannot show all planned routes on the map simultaneously. I have returned to using Locus maps for hiking & Google maps for driving. | Amazing routing for hiking | Muy buena app. Los mapas tienen muy buena calidad, y tienen bastante detalle. Me parece muy útil la representación con colores de las pendientes de las montañas | Excellent sat navigation, thank you. | Skvělá aplikace, ale opravdu nejsem rád, že mě Mapy nutí k vyhození mého skvělého, ne levného telefonu a pořizování nového jen proto, že přestaly fungovat na Androidu 7. A protože kapesní telefony, jako mám teď (Xperia Z5 Compact) už se nevyrábí, je zřejmě čas, podívat se po jiných mapách. | Very accurate maps. Love the app! | Excellent, simple, quick and has all you really need | I am using the app on every biking trip. It's very detailed. I can find almost every path. | Beautiful interface, but the registration was a mess. The app and map layout is great. | The application request to send a paid SMS to register an account with them. How much will cost ? 1$? 100$? 1000$? What's the point ? There are plenty of FREE navigation apps where you can register with google account but no, Mapy request you to register with phone number sending a paid SMS. No thank! | All es gut | It's very helpful in navigating no matter where you are. | Great map, fast and simple user interface. The drawback is that, offline without internet connection, it is not possible to save a waypoint, record a track, import a track. Update: The biggest drawback is that the hillshade is not available offline. This is the main reason I do not use Mapy.cz much anymore. | Much frustrating experience . The map is good, the registration process terribly awkward, lackluster, whatever you like to name it.... getting lots of error messages on the way, and need to start all the process again every time. You also need to SEND a SMS to them for verifying your phone number, and there is no way to bookmark waypoints on the map without registering first. Online support is only in Czech. I gave up! | Excellent help when walking new routes. | Detailed flexible | Is ""create new account"" ever working? | Excellent app with clear maps with great detail in my area | I have just started using this map in Madeira and the walking maps and small pathways in towns etc are far superior than Google maps. | Best ski maps for europe countries | Great app really useful in remote areas (with downloaded) have used it throughout outback Australia and in Western Nepal. | I really like the look of these maps and the fact you can download them and also into SD card. Best map app. Bike navigation somewhat good but needs optimization or more options | Excellent maps clear view, great offline and off road | By far the best map app not only in Czechia. It's a bit of a shame that more people around the world don't use it to add photos and reviews in other countries. | great app | p.o.s. | Amazing 😍 | Great app | Good for hiking navigation | Everything is fine, but I can't make an account. They say that I have to send SMS message to THEM to verify my phone number. I'm not so dumb to fall for this and loose money lol | I do long-distance walking across countries in Europe and this app is perfect for finding and following the best route - I use the walking and tourist mode which shows the best routes avoiding roads. | Wish to share geo coordinate to load in other maps for different functions that this map doesn't have. Thanks. Drawing attention using 4 stars. | Best mapping app, at least for Czechia. Much better arranged compared to the Google maps, that looks like 50 shades of gray and beige. Pub and shops icons are displayed all at once, Google shows them dynamically, who pays more is shown, other pubs are visible in really close zoom only. So it really hard guess what is in vicinity just by looking on the map. Metro exits in Prague are easily visible on Mapy.cz, not so much for Google map. | Best hiking maps for Android | Great for detailed information, not recommending the navigation.. | Very good! | Great apps for navigation!!!👍👍👍 | Very detailed oudoor maps | Way better than google maps for Czechia | The maps are a top dollar 5* experience. Like looking at an oldfashioned typographical map. They have really stepped up the game recently. The app is more or less perfect now. Still suggesting alternative and completely useless routes along the way, but at least they are in grey now and not sharp colours confusing to the eye. | It's perfekt for hiking and riding. The details are marvelous! The best I know! | So far most user friendly app - legible, fast, intuitive, practical - as compared to laptop, the best feature is however customizable plotting of loop tracks . It will create loop tracks based on your input parameters...splendid if you do not know the area.As compared to backcountry guru maps, and viewranger If you travel worldwide this is the best even with the limited topo capabilities, e.g. slope available on line only. Definitely great back up for usually unreliable gps plotting apps. Still | Will not work after this last update | Samotná navigace je super, bohužel používání pro android auto kdy bych rád měl i při jízdě bez navigace ukazatel rychlosti a upozornění na policii atd. Tak jako to má waze. | Great offline capabilities. Well detailed maps. Recommend for outdoor enthusiasts. | Free trail maps. Love it | Gold standard for hiking | Easy to use, maps are sufficiently informative (Bulgaria). It is great that you can type a starting and ending point like on Google maps. You can even link multiple points on the map to create a route and save it. | Nice! Very good map & navigation! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Velice perfektni pouziti pri planu trasy pesky, behu, na kole, bezkach, skialpech, sneznicich... (zimni mapa luxus). Rychla kontrola trasy pri aktivitach. Zlepseni a pridanim navigace i trackeru. Hmmm skoro kazdodenni pouziti aplikace. Nezbyva nez smeknout klobouk a podekovat velice. Zaverem rici kez by bylo takovych appek vice! Jen tak dal. | Great, free offline maps. | Super! | This is the best navigational app I've ever used. Only problem with this is that it doesx not show the POI's when you are on a route so you can't see when you reach a POI. | Great app. Wish it was easier to make an account | Great detailed maps, good App ♥️ | Very good maps, with cycling and hiking routes. Really enjoying it. Offline navigation works perfectly. | I wonder if you can help as the help page is in Czech language. If I create a route in the app which includes dirt roads the app will not let me follow this route,it chooses a route only using tarmac roads. The application is advertised as being useful for cycling and hiking. Even if I add extra via points it still will not follow a route across dirt roads. Creating these routes on a computer can be done but not in the app. Is there any way to do this because the app itself is extremely good! | Very useful app. Works perfectly | Cannot create account.. SMS is not working.. Worst account creation process.. | I love mapy CZ specifically because of the contour lines that it has, helping me to know the altitude of a place easily | Best app for hiking in Central Europe! | The only app i have found which co tain most of the subroutes in South Africa. Usually extremely accurate and has saved me a few times in terms of routefinding hard sections | Awesome!!! | I use it all the time for any trailwalk or hike. Great app! | Very useful app.Thank a lots 👍 | We hiked in fog,darkness. Pinpoint to the mountain refuge. | Great app for outdoor navigation. Accurate and free maps which you can download for offline use is exceptional. | Great detail | Nejlepsi appka na svete, turisticky mapy fungujou snad vsude na svete. Dik za ni. | Great app and up to date map! Very good navigation! | good maps with great color scheme | Od poslední aktualizace nepoužitelné pro navigaci. Co chvíli se ztrácí GPS signál a vyhledává. Lokace skáče kolem dokola pár desítek metrů od aktuální l. Přístup k poloze je povolen a při používání aplikace k přesné poloze Musím teď používat Google maps, které tyto problémy nemají. Zatím žádná nová verze dostupná :-( Nechci dávat malé hodnocení protoze jinak je aplikace super. Telefon: Realme 11 Pro+ | Very good outdoor maps | Terrible design, bad ui, doesnt work how i would imagine a map to work at all. Can someone design a good map app? Why do i not get results for what i search? I search ""shop"" and only get results with the name shop in it, no supermarkets, nothing, only ""shop"". Sometimes the map gives me results that are hundreds of kilometers away!?! When i search for something near a bus stop, it gives no results. only good thing about this app is the actual map, like the map for woods, forest trails is great. | Supr | Awesome app, easy to use, easy to understand. It has save me more than once! Can't recommend it enough | Easy to use, reliable and with accurate maps! | Not able to install offline maps on my new SD card (Realme 8 / Android 13 + RealmeUI 4). Camera works fine with the same SD card, so there is no reason, why Mapy.cz should not recognize it. | Free offline maps for the entire world! Trails, paths, roads, and businesses | Love the offline maps | Best visual cartographical aesthetics of topographic maps. but I miss former perfect offline modes... | Absolute fantastic map app with offline capabilities. A must have for outdoors hiking. | najlepsie mapy na turistiku | Superb! | The best map for hiking and cycling. | Much better than Google Maps for more remote locations. | Excellent, can now also import gpx files | Bombice! | The best maps for hiking and cycling | Just found link. Will tell you more when used | really nice app, use it each time I travel and I have no wifi or internet connection. Quite good for walking in town. But sometime, if map are not updated they are not visible at all and that can be bothering if you didn't see it before... The offline map should be readable even if it's not updated as road, building doesn't move thst fast. | Excellent app, can use it all over the world 👍. Good detail and works well as a driving seat nav | very good | Perhaps the best navigation map | Při plánování cesty autem nedokáže ""projet"" tunelem Munt la Schera. Ani když v trase dám průjezdní bod před tunel a za tunelem. | I find the app good to organise my bicycle routes on the road and my running in forest... | THE BEST! Maps available for many countries at good scale. Never let me down.... | What a great app. I can't recommend anything else. | Awesome app for cycle touring | Always reliable | The best navi apps | cannot verify my account. sent countless texts as requested, nothing comes back. | I've used it in Austria, Greece and Hungary and I love it! | I have downloaded all off-line maps for Australia but there's sections that have highways just stopping and town names completely missing. Even the borders between states aren't there? | Co si máme povídat... Nejlepší v Čechách (to říká vám kurýr s 7 let praxe), a to ne jen že Mapy cz mají nejlépsi kartografie v Čechách, ale aj vůbec funkcionality apku a interface... Ne můžu si představit že bych šel už do jiné Mapy/Na... | Great app. Useful for finding hidden paths that are not visible on another maps. Great offline access. Unfortunately navigation exits once phone is locked, please fix it. | Podrobnost map je mnohem lepší než konkurence, už funguje i navigace dobře a firmy se už taky dají najít. Ještě pár much to má, ale klobouk dolů. A kupodivu fungují na místech kde Google maps ne. | pridejte prpsim jednodussi zpusob Pridat bod pri navigaci / Add stop nejdou Tipy na vylety na turisticke mapě super turisticke mapy, hodnoceni ale nefunguje jako v Google maps, chtelo by vylepsit, zbytečně slozite hodnoceni a schvaluje se | Absolutely brilliant Especially offline | Skvělá appka na mapy, nejlepší pro turistiku, cyklistiku, výborná i na silnici, v zimě, dobrá už i pro výběr české restaurace/hotelu apod. 2 hvězdičky dole za: chybějící fotomapu a měření pomocí bodů, za hloupé přeskakování na mapě, když člověk něco zavře (třeba trasu), za horší vyhledávač a za někdy velké nepřesnosti v cizině. | Very nice map navigation with real offline mode. Fast, detailed, easy readable, can calculate routes in offline mode. | In Pakistan, it's still needed some more time to improve. | Don't understand what's going on here. Downloaded all Australians off-line maps and they don't work. Highways just stop in the middle of the map and most towns don't show. Also borders between states won't display? | Best outdoor, offline navigation, trail/track planning maps so far. Those maps are real topographic maps, not a joke. And free to download and use for offline navigation which is amazing feature. You can save your trails/tracks, export/import GPX files while still being simple and easy to use. I've tried many different hiking/outdoor navigation apps and maps, but nothing can beat precision of Mapy.cz. Not even Garmin maps. Very much recommended to any outdoor enthusiasts in Europe. | Naučí se někdy mapy.cz navigovat podle mhd (praha, brno, ...) Aspoň tak jako Google maps? | Best navigation app. You can use it for bike touring and it gives you even the weather forecast on the map! It allows you to download multiple maps at the same time. You can even choose section of a country (north, south, or particular regions...) TO IMPROVE: Login with Facebook/Google missing. | Excellent | Love it ! | Asks for telephone number to create an account | Great App. | Opening a GPS track forces you to create an account to seznam.cz, which has nothing to do with gps mapping. | Great app, but unable to get registered, why can't it be done through Email ? | Fantastic app | Great map for hiking, it has all the small paths that are not on most of the other apps, and I like the tracking where it tells you elevation gain, distance and average speed. I recommend this, offline maps for download is a good feature if you have bad signal in some places. | The best app ever!!! | Amazing app really useful | Mapy.cz shows you many ways and shortcuts which are not visible on Google maps. | Excellent for hiking anywhere in the world. Maps for driving sometimes inaccurate. | I used mapy for walking in Alsace, Brittany in France and Sussex UK and between the Algerian border and Tunis. It was excellent especially in Fr and UK. It was well detailed in Tunisia but did not show in some area established electricity lines and some well used roads. I expect that the small scale maps of Tunisia 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 are not available or do not exist. | It is a good app and the one I use for city driving | works great, trails marked on it well | Great app, very helpful and it works offline | Does everything I expect. | Great sport-focussed alternative to Gmaps. Super handy | Best map app available, in my opinion. ""Outdoor"" map is particularly high quality, like an OS map. Integrates seamlessly with GPS and compass to provide both position and orientation. Plus the ability to download maps by country, so it works outside of mobile signal. I don't use the sat nav function, so can't comment on that. | Super | Velmi mi schází tmavý mód i mimo navigování (není to jen o vzhledu, je to důležité při použití za šera či tmy). | Keď chcem po ceste niekam pridať rýchlu zastávku (napr bankomat) tak je absolutne nemožné to efektívne urobiť keďže v navigácii nieje žiadna rýchla možnosť na vyhľadanie zastávky po ceste. Jediná možnosť je modifikovať celú pôvodnú trasu s tým že pri vyhľadávaní výsledkov vám automaticky neukáže miesta ktoré sú popri vašej trase ale miesta úplne mimo cesty. Toto prosím nejak fixnite (napr ako má google maps, kde prehľadne ukazuje ""zajížďku"") a zmením hodnotenie na 5 hviezdičiek. | Awesome! Can recommend trails for cycling and navigate on them for free. May be not the best ones, though. | Offline mapy se dají stahovat jen podle názvů regionů, které samozřejmě v Rakousku neznám. Výběr z mapy by byl přehlednější | Very helpful map. Just the handling/ operation could be improved. Thank you | Super aplicația dar m-am chinuit 2 ore sa mă înregistrez | The app seems nice, but insists on getting your phone number. And when I finally decided to give it, it didn't work. | Awesome maps | Brilliant maps with brilliant features, also usfull outside Czech republic. Should become european standard :) | Super | Brilliant App and walking aid. | Aplikace Mapy.cz je SKVELA! Velmi detailni, dobre se pouziva. Je intuitivni, staci zapnout start a muzete jit/bezet .... Aplikace nepada, ani se neseka. Sve aktivity si muzete zaznamenavat do folderu a delat si sve osobni trasy. | Will be your preferred hiking map | Best one if you like hiking. Long live to OpenStreetMaps!! Would be awesome that we could search routes by their name and trail appeared on the map. Here in Spain we have walking routes called GR. When you do a search (for example GR 83) appear some results but they are mostly not useful, however sometimes, there is a result that gives exactly what I'm suggesting (very hidden and sometimes doesn't even appear).

Much better arranged compared to the Google maps, that looks like 50 shades of gray and beige. Pub and shops icons are displayed all at once, Google shows them dynamically, who pays more is shown, other pubs are visible in really close zoom only.

It used to stick to the selected route while navigating and it would only recalculate if I diverted from that route. Now it keeps switching between different routes, no matter which one I had preselected. It's really annoying as it keeps changing directions all the time and I don't know anymore which turning is the correct one. Sometime it even switches between routes when standing still at traffic light. EDIT: fixed, 5* again. Thx"",""Great maps for driving navigation and hiking and using offline. We used offline maps for Ontario, Canada and it helped us a lot. In offline mode you can see only downloaded regions, so you need to download maps for your desired regions before you go offline. I was impressed how exact the maps are. Some places are missing, so online I usually use both mapy.cz and Google maps together. Both of them have features that the latter doesn't have. Mapy.cz is my No.1 for hiking and offline navigation."",""I am actually very happy with this app and definitely recommend it! So far, when it comes to Czech and Slovak tourists paths and maps of nature in general, I still didn't find an better app for such purpose. It even helped me when I got seriously lost on a forest path in complete darkness. Only because of it being so precise and me being able to download offline maps for regions I was visiting beforehand. I had no service in the hills, so it literally saved me a huge amount of trouble! Thx"",""Absolutely perfect and indispensable tool for planning daily trips. I have been using it for 10 years but it is constantly getting better. Recently, using it with navigation under lock screen during bike trips also works nicely. There are options to select from to match your road preference.

The only problem is that it is a free app but you have to pay for almost every nice feature, I made alot of videos using this. My editing experience has never been better. If you dont post on social media or dont wanna make videos, there are templates, templates are good for two things. One, making fast easy videos, and two, it is good for entertainment if you are bored. It also has pro features for free sometimes. I highly recommend getting this editing software | Nice one | Excellent | D ako maka edit | Daahirasad | nice | Zabii | Maharimran Maharimahar | Overall great! But I never felt safe on this app, I ended up deleting it because I found out that it was created by the owners of tiktok. | It's so 👍 | I want to use this app for some important thing | Capcut has been terrible I can't even update it I'll have to uninstall and then install it again for it to work And now I'm trying to download it It can't download | Great 👍. One of the best free editing apps on phone! Great range of free effects and editing necessaties. A problem : it lags though , normally when you have a lot of short videos and lots of effects in your video. This occurs mostly during editing which can make it hard for it to make it good content.

Jen mi přijde, že některé podniky ji využívají jen pro své zviditelnění. | Lowering raring as the app does not work. Everything is blank, does not load and I don't receive notifications 😩 | Negativní komentáře jsou mazány, hodnocení nabídek v aplikaci má tedy nulovou výpovědní hodnotu. | Zajímavá myšlenka, ale je potřeba si nalít čistého vína a říct si, že ve většině případů nejde o zachraňování světa nebo jedení jídla, které by jinak skončilo v koši. Je to marketing, nic víc. Starbucks, který mapu naprosto dominuje, je krásným příkladem. | Hodilo by se mít více filtrů. Například odfiltrovat si Penny, které je na mapě skoro všude a spíše mě zajímají jiné podniky. | Koncept velmi dobrý, ale ta aplikace je zoufale pomalá. Dobré by bylo tlačítko filtru - zobrazení aktivních/všech nabídek. | Chybí možnost zrušit objednávku. Systém balíčků, kdy člověk kupuje v podstatě zajíce v pytli je k NIČEMU. Člověk doufám, že budou třeba dva sandwiche cca 1000kalorii, dojde do krámu a dostane nějaké sušenky. Cukrářské výrobky ten stejný problém. Nemožnost schovat podniky co mě absolutně nezajímají je taky velká nevýhoda, začíná to být nepřehledné | Dobře a jednoduché. | I like the concept and this app but unfortunately it is pretty slow and lags a lot. | Amazing selections and always working properly. Got used to using it for all kinds of goods; sweet, savoury, flowers you name it. | I love the app and the concept behind it. The only thing I do not appreciate is that the is no ""in stock"" filter for the map. Otherwise it would be perfect! | Amazing app! Super useful for not wasting. 💚 | Naprosto skvela appka!!! | Aplikace dobrá, Starbucks balíček horší :-( | Slow and bad application | Do recommend! | This is a lie. Restaurants offer not leftovers from unsold food, but food of terrible quality. | Po přechodu do zelene appky.. des, hrůza a chaos... Téměř kvůli tomu už appku ani nepoužívam | super služba, lepší filtrovaní a větší výběr podniků by byl fajn | Super věc 👍 | Nikdy v živote som nevidela pomalšiu aplikáciu ako táto. Nová verzia s novým designom je nepoužiteľná, už len na zmenu mesta z Prahy na Brno čakám niekoľko sekúnd. Rada som objednávala cez nesnezeno, ale toto sa naozaj nedá používať. | Krok zpět. Opravdu špatné UX. Nedaří se mi ani dokončit nákup (jsem vyzván k vyplnění jména ale bohužel není, kde jej vyplnit). Košík nefunguje jako košík, protože nejsem schopen koupit více zboží v jedné objednávce. Zboží nelze z košíku odstranit. Místy nelogická navigace. UI je nedotažené - ikony různých velikostí, které různě poskakují, špatně řešené stíny, usekávající se text, tlačítko ""-"" v košíku má zelenou barvu namísto oranžové atd. Koncept balíčků se mi líbí. | Super koncept, avšak update z jednoduchej a prehladnej aplikácie spravil neprehľadnú a ešte aj pomalú aplikáciu | Appka mě baví, šetří mi penízky! Super za mě. | Was good before the update, after that not only constantly logging out but also not remembering settings of preferences and showing random places at the map that are no close to the actual location. | Nevím, jestli to někdo koupil ale aplikace je po redesignu otřesná. Předchozí nastavení zmizelo (včetně platebních metod). Vypadá to jako úmyslná sabotáž. | Probably depends on the store how they add the offer, most are now mystery boxes with pastry or a meal but with some of them you know exactly what you're buying. Definitely worth keeping eye on. The more stores join in the future the better of course! | dost dobra appka pre studenta s minimom casu a obmedzenym budgetom, rychle prehladavanie aj platenie, spokojnost :) | Hodnocení po velkém update aplikace. Změna byla nečekaná, ze začátku jsem byla hodně zklamaná že se v aplikaci nachází pouze balíčky. Nicméně cca 14 dní po změně je vidět že přibylo hodně nových podniků a i nabídka není jen o balíčcích. Věřím, že s dalším časem se nová tvář aplikace vykrystalizuje do 5 hvězdiček. | Dneska měla akorát vypadek ale jinak funguje dobře. Samotný koncept se mi velice líbí a na vyzkoušení cukráren vážně super | Oproti předchozí verzi nepoužitelné. | Spousta zelené. Mám rád zelenou. A taky jídlo za fajn cenu. Mám rád jídlo za fajn cenu. | Thanks for the reply but I am lowering the rating as from user's point of view these updates make no sense. This is an app for buying lefover food from restaurants. There must be the option to like the restaurant as a whole and not be only able to like selected products. The ""products"" are different every day, these are restaurants, not supermarkets with fixed offer. Because of that I now don't get notified about offers from my favourite places as they always offer new stuff. | Po update se aplikace téměř nedá použít. Je méně přehledná, je problém s platby kartou. Nevím proč transakce se zasekla a musel jsem to platit na 3x. Hodnocení původně 5 hvězd, ale po update je to katastrofa. Důvody: -Proč hned není jasné o jaký typ jídla se jedná (např. balíčky ze starbucksu) -Proč vidím jídlo, které už se nenabízí. Zbytečně to mate. -Proč platba probíhá komplikovaněji, než u předchozí verze -Proč jsou nahoře nabídky, které ani nejsou reklama. Jenom upoutávky...nedává smysl | The new version of this app is not great. Everything is now in packages, so you can't actually know what you are buying, which to me made this app useless. Also, food that is not available keeps popping up. This used to be an amazing app. | Every offers are not available, also it logged me out for unknown reason. All (one) offers is only Starbucks... so useless app. | Zbytečně zkomplikované oproti předchozí verzi. Méně je někdy více. | Aktualizace, která extrémně zkomplikovala používání této aplikace. Aplikace si nepamatuje nastavení lokace, přidání zbytečných záložek jako je lokalita, která funguje jen v praze, pro hledání nabídek je nutno přepnout do jiné záložky. To vše znamená, že nalezení nabídky trvá přibližně 10x déle. Také zobrazení již nedostupných nabídek je horší (černobílé zobrazení bylo rozhodně přehlednější). | Not usefull anymore | Nová appka je katastrofa.. jsou v ní pouze starbucksy a to i ty, kteří se nesnezena neúčastní (po koupi balíčku mi obsluha na černém mostě řekla, ze jejich pobočka součástí programu není. UI je chaotické, nové tlačítko complete order je matoucí, že jsem si ho omlylem odkliknul sám, vůbec není indikace, že to je tlacitko pro obsluhu (bývalý slide button byl lepší). Dále také se tam míchají jazyky, chvílema česky, anglicky, pak dokonce maďarsky. Bývalá appka byla rozhodně daleko lepší. | co to jako je #cider#puffbar#cotojakoje#notsatisfied | Veľmi prehľadné, až mam pocit, že niečo chýba. Ale stačí k spokojnosti | Zvysujem z 2 na 4. Zvaly su uz konecne stale a tak sa nestane ze tam niekto nahadzuje svoju ponuku a zlavy ju o 10%. Taktiez v appke vsetci uz poctivo nahadzuju alergeny. old:Nie je mozne nastavit si filtrovanie len bezlepkovych ponuk takze 99% ma nezaujima. Nie je mozne nastavit si filtrovanie len do urciteho kilometra okolo mna, takze 99% zobrazeni ma nezaujima. Niektore podniky by som rad dal do ignore listu, ale appka taku moznost neponuka 🤷 inak fajn pokus o nieco ekologicke a ekonomicke. | Výborná myšlenka, ale aplikace mi reálně nikdy nepomohla nějakou nabídku najít. Špatně se v ní vyhledávají podniky, notifikace vyskakuji asi na sponzorované podniky - stále stejné, typicky frančízové řetězce, relativně vzdálené a s nezajimavou nabídkou. Nic od podniků ze seznamu oblíbených. Příležitostně na cestách jsem si aplikaci nezvykl používat. PS: dnes spadl server, takže aplikace neukazuje nic. | Myslím, že váš úkol je nelehká a dlouhá cesta. Velmi fandím fajn myšlence. Předpokládám, že vám píše mnoho lidí a sami se snažíte působení rozšířit. Myslím, že by stálo za zvážení oslovit některé liberecké restaurace. Krajské město, spousta možností. Navíc 13km vedle je Jablonec, takže spousta lidí mezi městy pendluje. Kéž se daří! | It's super easy to use. Not many options yet, but hopefully more will follow soon! | Super napad ale prevedenie... Ziadne vyhladavanie ci filtre (typ restauracie, cena, vegan...), na mape sa zobrazuju i podniky ktore aktualne nemaju ziadne jedlo (ziadne i uz zjedene; keby boli aspon inak oznacene). Chybaju uplne zakladne funkcie. Obrazky su pre mna osobne prilis velke, ocenil by som moznost mensieho textu. Kazdopadne je skvele ze tato aplikacia existuju a vyhadzuje sa menej jedla, len UI by sa dal vylepsit. | Aplikace je ok ale prijde mi, ze to podniky zacinaji zneuzivat. Stava se z toho damejidlo bez rozvozu. Sleva ze 159 na 149? Zebirka z 319kc na 299? To ani nejsou slevy. Je to drazsi jak v hospode. Pokud je potreba nutne se jidla zbavit bez toho, aby se vyhodilo, sleva 3% mi neprijde na miste. | Great selection&very positive atmosphere.Unfortunately,the application still insists on location permission.Thanks so for your reply!That's a good idea&will help a bit but my actual location permission is still necessary. :( Will you guys consider allowing users to type in the address they want to deliver the food to? 'Cause it's a super idea but I have friends stuck in quarantine who I'd love to send doughnuts to.Tried&paid but have to cancel the order now.Delivery wasn't included in the bill. | Alespon nazev mohl byt spravne cesky-tedy Nesnědeno!...copak jste dnes snezli? holt Brno;-) | Nice app. There is a room for improvement. Add filters. For example, by food type (mexican, indian, vegetarian, vegan etc.), by the discount rate (as for some people it is important), Add a search function (by name, food type, etc.) Think of working with shops (it is a huge market as well) Develop a dark mode as ""light attracts bugs"" (c) Add Order ID to the order info (main page of the order). It's not user-friendly to click on ""doklad"" to check it. I like what you are doing. Keep going. | Nice app for saving food not eaten in proper time schedule ;) Or do you prefer late lunch? So this app is also perfect for you! Now also for take-away and saving restaurants... | It helps me to discover new places, have a great food4 half price! Awesome👍😉 | Naprosto úžasná aplikace! Po vylepšení nastavení města je to naprosto úžasné!!! ❤️❤️❤️ | Riadne super napad | Super nápad, super aplikace. | Devs took criticism to heart and updated the app. It now allows for filtering through location in one of its two pages. The page with restaurants still shows places from other cities. There's a map feature but as far as I can tell it only shows the restaurants on a map, which feels useless. Needs filtering there as well. And maybe re-think the use cases for the map feature, as it doesn't make mich sense. | Nesnezeno se porad vyvyji, s kazdou verzi je lepsi a myslim, ze jde o skvely projekt. | It shows offers in different location, even though I have a location on... and that is really annoying | Great idea! Thank you! | Jen škoda že se zatím nezapojila žádná restaurace v Pardubicích/Chrudimi, jinak cením tento nápad! | Nejlepší nápad a appka super. :) | Skvělý nápad, ale nabídky mi zase tak skvělé nepřišly a v některých mistexh nich zase tak noc nebylo | skvela myslenka a super ux aplikace :) | Unfortunately not available for most cities, just Praha, Brno, Ostrava, Olomouc basically. | V Ostravě téměř nic a propagovaná Olomouc není ani v nabídce. | Naozaj skvelá appka, funguje dokonale. | aplikácia funguje na výbornú | very good | A great idea! The app is reallly smooth, excellent designed and a very user friendly interface. | Veľmi pekná aplikácia a super projekt! :) | app does not work for LG G6. 3 from 4 buttons on the bottom are not active, and some icon is flashing in bottom left corner. App is not compatible with software system buttons (home,back) | Dobrý myšlenka, ale pouze Brno, Ostrava a Budějovice :/","{""1"":337,""2"":94,""3"":137,""4"":137,""5"":642}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Nesnězeno.cz s.r.o.","Nesn%C4%9Bzeno.cz+s.r.o.","info@nesnezeno.cz","https://nesnezeno.cz",,"https://nesnezeno.eco/privacy-policy/","Nesn%C4%9Bzeno.cz+s.r.o.","Food & Drink","FOOD_AND_DRINK","[{""name"":""Food & Drink"",""id"":""FOOD_AND_DRINK""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r-nBLUnl3iBs4NY8tFXziijGlv5KI1rEJkOVLZQHfmFbA09ky1sOALHIluxHRIcwcQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wHXDgMaNN7k-_g5mfCFYUZDDctUrOqc-Ifi4R0jGG0QRIc40qhRIYR8tT41RYDmf3CJQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r5Gm5p6xFuJShPmFSxvIDJ0w1te90FJcmHtwP_TSsyhrCsXXMVlMvQyyBlCzBTNqbxg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/K00KrfpFRVT7fo7NM1Llm-ekepnQsHy4T4VCxOAO2WXMlEGjwbodCTrNdoMxqk0fHQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Qj4NbG4w1eHATdYc3p-WU7Emy4HP14oIsBTT1VlJ2h8V3rN4W5SJB03ALG0KusMG5_6f"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7yWGVoWeP1LKyaGqMt7c4PmLmua_IMxLfKps8l6Xlvf0gp0ceTTVjT4X_RSdqbMMttQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gOY7TQymILIWtu26Nuspry2BEqIv846d7Efc-5sD5NOrFpy5sO8YBGQu8oK6iZsin45k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Wm6IKvl_iWLx-uYeOBoTxQWtPIkHA7bhJbGRgTtYm5YO-ocavdrapN1x-DdUortREgw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GZaJCbcsZ-hHR3waYsM7dgQmMRQqq82jhBLvQbyOB3S2el2Zrh41E-TSuUXjoL3cCxcM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XuyB5WaU2cHps8O5p1bp9EK79AoB8qvhVTEXvR7JOEmOtoInAGaPSqMmaPUemtiqrQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H1YxGZOW1bbbNmMRknd_kDbt6vWTC8rngKVrA1QX3-fC3hHkdYzMjj4qRfT7UUSqTA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bQvUTtoSSRo8w1YO4xnA3GyyX9MPqzfCc_mpgbMbghwyOq_6q98vpwky04t4P8yD7Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yefNpvMwAILFP3GKTvERuH8qKL3Z5lQi-wi9OATKZB82oAFC7q6ZSVGpnzZa64iJbY4_"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KpmvkOo22Rvb7lpWIbymnRnY3u5UUxcD0ns_zwG26E6ju-MKjpub88wFGKK6N0F9Weu6""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Apr 29, 2019",1710164972000,"4.9.0","Small changes &amp; bugfixes","[""Devs took criticism to heart and updated the app. It now allows for filtering through location in one of its two pages.

Edit: Product descriptions are what would make me buy an item. So if the settings are in English and the actual offers are not then no point. | MINUS -----10 | Updated by itself without my knowledge. Uninstalled, this behaviour is not tolerated. | Doesn't do anything at login. Force stop, restart etc same issues. Lame! | Ofertele de weekend le gasesti doar la reclamele pe televizor, in aplicatie nu apar, 0, ai aplicatie degeaba instalata, iar produsele care le gasesti in aplicatie reduse la pret, nu le gasesti in magazin, Nu ai semnal in kaufland, iti bruiaza semnalul de la telefon, nu inteleg care e scopul, Kaufland bruiaza semnalul de telefonie ceea ce este o grava incalcare a legilor, dosar penal pentru Kaufland. | Total mess | I can't register the card! The app crashes It happens even after the update | Digital receipt not workng!!! Make it available, or take it off the options! | Би било добре при положение че има игра с колелото, то да е активно след покупка независимо дали ти е бил пуснат интернета по време на покупката. Забелязах го на няколко пъти и всеки път когато съм пазарувала със спрян интернет след това не е можело да се възползвам от играта. | Useless app. You have to make new reg everytime and lose your points, discounts etc. Digital card it not working!!!!! | Snadné nakupování | Регистрирана съм и ползвах приложението, но ето че днес отново ми иска регистрация. Много зле!!! | Seit ein paar Wochen wird meine Kaufland Card nicht mehr angezeigt. Ebenso die bereits gesammelten Punkte. Da wo die KCard normalerweise angezeigt wird steht jetzt ich müsse mich für die Karte registrieren, die Funktion ist allerdings verbuggt und es passiert nichts. | I've reinstalled the app 4 times and agreed to everything and still can't see the weekly brochures. The only thing I see is a message to try again later, and that's it. What's the point of this app if I can't see the most important part of it? | Лийфлета никога не се вижда. И не е до интернет връзка, защото приложенията на билла, лидл си работят без грешка. Просто ИТ отдела Ви не струва. | Great, now with language selection. | pros • app funguje ; cons • bloky nie su vidiet ked clovek nakupi len kartickou >> cislo mate , pokladne su online , tak syncujte • mix s online trhoviskom robi chaos >> customer vidi jednu znacku - online obchod uvedte len ako "" inu prevadzku "" • login with fb want email code which is hard to get with low memory because of app switch , meanwhile google login is ok | The terms and conditions are in German with no option to see them in English or Romanian since this is an app for Romanian stores. To get worse the imprint states this app is owned by kaufland Bulgaria?! | Nu poți să îți activezi cardul. Aplicația este dezvoltată cel mai probabil de niste indieni școliți in ale IT ului pe YouTube, in timpul liber. | I already have an account. but it always fails when registering for the card. I've also signed up for a card, but after clicking ok, it always goes back to mainpage. It's so complicated and not simple to sign up 2 times just for the same company. Can't you just make it simple? Sign up, and you got AUTOMATICALLY digital card? It's almost 2024 cmone! Don't make it complicated and too much action. | Брошурата не зарежда в 9 от 10 случая. Трябва да чакам половин минута на страница, а интернетът ми е 100Mbs. И не мога да я изтегля. Пълен боклук е този ап. | I can't connect to my account. I can't write my email,it doesn't let me to write. | They don't provide customer service to ask questions to resolve issues. I don't know why they promote DHL while Hermes is more reliable. Also, it was very important to me to buy router for internet, my time is getting wasted, but their customer service has not done a single good thing to reply. Update: I contacted through both ways: filling out contact form and calling on the phone number provided, neither worked. | Oribila! | Sorry but this is the worst app I have seen. I have really made my best and gave new and new attempts including deleting cache and data but without success. Issues I have experienced: logging off and leaving me at the cash desk with no possibility to use and recover it (returning errors), later not able to register to the K-card - WHY the card is not part of the account? After completing all the required data, I was not able to proceed and display it. I recommend to rebuild the app from scratch. | After the last update lost all the data, all points. App asks me to register for k card which I had, but then I enter my login info it just refreshes the page and asks again if I want to sign up for card Upd: it's been a month and nothing changed, same problems | Nu merită 2 bani | nu m a lasat doamna de la kaufland sa platesc cu oferta si m a jignit | In general the app works well. My problem is that I already have an old physical card and I have tried to add it to the app. The message I get after entering the number is ""this card has already been assigned"". I have no idea what that means but I cannot see the physical card in the app and the points do not change. I asked in one of your stores and although they tried the result was the same. Why can't I see the old card in the app? | I am not able to create a digital kaufland card from this app | This app is dead! About a week ago I wanted to use it and noticed that it logged me out. I tried to log back in but it's impossible. It's all messed up. I even tried to register anew but nothing works. I have no other choice but to remove it cause it's useless now. It always worked bad, always had problems with the self-check and the scanner, but now it just stopped working altogether. I even tried to reinstall it, but it's no use. Big disappointment! | Almost everything available | Funktioniert nicht. Account ist da aber Karte lässt sich nicht anzeigen, ""register now"" - wenn man klickt passiert gar nix. Beim Versuch die TelNr im Profil zu ergänzen ""there is already an account connected to this number"" - wer hätte das gedacht?? Antwort: Chrome ist installiert. Das Problem ist dass diese Applikation zwar mein Profil hat, aber die Karte nicht verknüpft!!! | If there is too much text on coupon detail, button is out of screen and its not possible to scroll. Please fix. Besides that its solid. | A helpful app to check leaflet, your receipts, your digital card to cover your shopping needs. | Pentru a beneficia de niste amarate de reduceri de 30 de bani, ca sa faci card de loialitate la Kaufland aparent este nevoie de adresa, apartament, date de nastere etc. Bine ca nu faceti si factura pe mail. Ce gluma de aplicatie. La alte magazine poti face card pe site web doar cu numele, numarul de telefon si mail. | The app has some issues while scanning. While it works for most of the cases, there are some where K-SCAN increases the value of the product. I got this experience when weighting some fruits. The printed price is different from K-SCAN. At self-checkout the in-shop scanner got the correct price. I still got the test cases. Please let me know if you need them so you can investigate the problem. | Plusy - Aplikácia je prehľadná a jednoduchá. - Bločky v elektronickej podobe. Mínusy - Vetu o aplikácii kupónu by som dal väčším písmom na začiatok zoznamu kupónov. Teraz je to na konci a stráca sa to v množstve malých písmeniek. - Chýba vyhľadávanie v ponukách. - Nedá sa nastaviť, aby boli bločky iba v elektronickej podobe (bez papiera). | 1000 times registered card 0 results | Its aight | I use it almost every time I shop at Kaufland. What I like a lot is the digital receipts. You could add a simple feature. If a user taps an item on a receipt the item is automatically added to the shopping list. | The greatest BUG of all : ""The brochure could not be loaded "" i'm having this problem since a few mounths . LE: Still the same problem . Eviroment : (Oppo reno 6 pro , android 13 , ColorOs 13 . | The leaflet isn't loading, since last weak | It won't let me change first and last name in the app, useless | For one month I can't see next week offers despite it is Sunday today! | Good job having google certificate so I can log in to the app since you allow that. Yes that's sarcasm. Avoid this app if you can. Go to a different store. | Modesta, sunt oferte in aplicatie la care nici nu vede prețul din cauza butonului 'Activeaza"" | Mega slow loading. | Na ja, undurchsichtige App... Manche Angebote werden vom lokalen Warenhaus akzeptiert, andere nicht. Mit den Coupons könnte man ein wenig sparen wenn man sich viel Zeit nimmt und diese alle vor dem Einkauf markiert. Auch diese werden nicht immer anerkannt. Die Gutschrift von Bonuspunkten ist undurchsichtig und inkonsistent. Auch der Umrechnungsfaktor in EUR ist unklar. Manche Produkte werden mit Bonuspunkten günstiger. Nicht gerade diejenigen die man braucht... Also eher eine Bauernfänger App. | I love it! | Can not input date of birth on registering for Kaufland card - Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 pro | Възможно ли е да добавите ""Търсене"" в приложението? Например при аналогичното приложение в LIDL има такава възможност. | App is useless, card doesn't work | Излишно усложнено и неефективно. След много подробна регистрация не можах да се добера до картата | Bad and slow. Many times at the cash desk the card icon doesn't show up and first wants to update my data, practically unusable at that moment at cash desk. | Kscan functionality was way better when it was still a separate app | New version lacks the Digital Receips for past purchases, so for me is useless. | This app is absolutely not working since the new version after 5 September 2023. I even can not enter in my account. There is no worth to keep it. Even after giving a feed back to the Kaufland support by the phone one week ago, there is still no change and the app is still not working. I am very disappointed of such poor app support. P. S. : I've done more than your recommendations may be 20 times or more already and the app is still blocked. I even can not enter my user name or password. | The app is fine, personal in some shops have to be more polite. | It seems the app will occasionally get blocked by Google Apps since there seems to be an issue with the login security or something. And that will log you out and soft bann you making it impossible for you to log in into the app and use any of the functions including the card. This is now the second time this has happened and it's really not fun when it happens during your checkout process in the store... | -1 not 1 | You have problems with the application? Try to fix. Quick! Sorry, but still not work. When I try to open my account, don't want to open. The problem is since yesterday. My account works only on the pc. Your appologizes not help me. You complicate the problem. Try to fix. | Useless for paying using ""kaufland pay"" with my mobile. The app kept crashing while trying to generate the code. I even connected to the kaufland wifi network. I had to leave my groceries behind and go home. 😤 | Cannot even open the app after the last update. Keeps crashing while starting | След последният ъпдейт приложението постоянно крашва при стартиране. Нужно е да го стартирам 5-6 пъти, за да заработи нормално, и всички дигитални касови бележки изчезнаха. | When it required an update, suddenly i had no acount anymore and my mail ""wasn't in the system"". I created a new one but then it didn't accept date of birth. Well if they don't want me as a customer, then fine, the feeling's mutual. | a dark mode of some sort would be appreciated but other than that i an satisfied! 💜 | Very useful app. However : lately there's been an issue - products are NOT put into proper categories! When I sort products in my wishlist by categories, they are not correct. Almost ALL products are in one and the same category, e. g. different foods and drinks (cheese, alcoholic drinncs, waffles, etc) are under ""Electric appliances, media"". Too busy to add them where they belong? Down one star for this inconvenience. | Payments missed | broken login | Aplikace se sama odhlašuje. (To jsem psal před 3 roky a stále stejné. Po každém updatu, abych se přihlašoval znovu). | Von einem Tag auf anderen waren alle digitale Kassenzettel sowie Treuepunkte weg. Eine Option den Fehler zu melden habe ich in der App auch nicht gefunden =( | Overall good application with critical issues. Using K-scan it often crashes when you do the checkout at the till. Funny thing - when you reopen the app it shows a tiny icon with number (of items in your shopping cart) at K-scan. But there is no way to get back to your shopping cart, as clicking on K-scan gives you 2 options: to use current supermarket or to choose different one. With either your cart is reset! | It forgets the coins | Изхвърли ме от акаунта ми преди десетина дни, не мога мануално да въведа картата си, връща ме в меню ""register"" и не ми работи дори пластиката. Опитах всичко! Беше прекрасно приложение.Проблемът е масов и продължи твърде дълго. | I lost my points because of failure. | Last time my comment was somehow deleted. Ive got the app since 2022 I did it on a whim on my phone with generated Instant Pass, after that crush many have complaint. I can't log in, all my points are Lost for good I've tried to create another account alas the app is crushing and doesn't let me proceed!? | Cannot copy text from offers and coupons. Very slow app, unstable, offen crashing and restarting. | Wow, Kaufland actually managed to completely screw up the app with recent update. As an example, if you use English (or Slovak) language, and want to view your orders, you will be shown a German agreement of some sort where you need to agree to it in German. I also apparently lost my account and all my points. | I can not sign in my account. It directs me to chrome but the page doesn't work | Niciodată nu se găsesc la raft produsele cu discount din aplicație, deci aplicația este inutilă | It was a beautiful gesture from kaufLand. About 20 days ago we had a newborn and we called him Adam, so they sent us a lot of gifts with a bathrobe with his name written on it. Thank you very much for your kindness and wish you always well | App crashes every single time I open. GG. Nice work. | It keeps crashing. I installed it several times agaim ant it crashes all the time. It was fine untill today... | След ъпдейт на приложението не мога да си вляза в акаунта защото не си знам паролата..когато ползвам методът ""Forgot password"" изписва, че на телефонен номер трябва да получя съобщение с код за верификация, но такъв не идва. Телефоният номер е коректно попълнен. | След последната актуализация има много проблеми с приложението. Обикновено работи идеално, но съм установил напоследък, че макар да работи вкъщи, не работи в магазина в Кюстендил. Цяла седмица мъка, защото държа списъка за пазаруване в приложението, но като не работи... ужас. Получих бърз отговор от разработчика, надявам се скоро да се отстрани проблемът. Създава неприятности не само на клиентите, а и на касиерките, които работят толкова усърдно. Стискам палци | I've used the app via my Google account. However, currently there is no authorisation to log in with my Google account after the last update. | Боклук пълен | Fast jedes Mal funktioniert die App an der Kasse nicht oder fragt nach einem Login, was natürlich aufgrund der blockierten Internetverbindung funktioniert nicht | Скапано приложение като магазина скъпа и гадна стока. | I give this rating to the application for forced update at the moment when I am standing at the cash register and want to show the cashier a barcode. After that I was unlogged from the app altogether. Thank you, great solution! | Rundom unlog,and defecate to log in. | The app logged me out and when I logged back in, all my data was missing, including card, receipts and bonus points | Prihlaska do sourezi je moc komplikovana , mam zadat vsechni udaje ktere appliance vi dohromady vymaže všechno kdy zkouším ""paste"" Id karty A ted' ještě mám znovu se přihlásit na pokladně do aplikace, parada | Worst app ever! I do not recommend it. | No points after online purchases in Marketplace. No possibility to add a receipt after a purchase. | Totálně nahovno UI, ani se mi tam nejde přihlásit. | Te deloghează des și accesul la 'cardul kaufland' in loc sa fie unul simplu si cat mai la îndemână, mereu e alterat de promotii si termeni si conditii și altele popupuri care apar înainte. | Application does not work for some reason. I can't log in. I have to register again and lose my points. | ,y , 'r, | Tak v jednom případě z 10 funguje jak má. Jinak pořád nějaké chyby, něco nefunguje, už tolikrát jsem musela načíst celý košík znovu, a když se mi podaří zaplatit Kaufland Pay tak to je zázrak! Proč musí být zaplé notifikace, aby šlo platit K. Pay? A skener sotva načítá i dobře viditelné kódy (a není to foťákem, neboť aplikace Globusu to zvládne na stejném mobilu bezvadně a rychle). Doufám, že to vývojáři zlepší. | Putin dezamagit... Am card de mai bine de 2 ani la kaufland, dar dupa ce mi-am facut cont in aplicatie n-am gasit un loc unde sa adaug cardul pe care-l am deja... doar sa fac altul nou | whats the purpose of birthday coupons when the stuff is not available in the store? 🙄 | Cannot even login. Want to use Google login and only get Google error saying that their app is blocked. Made in Germany at its best. | Nu va merge serveru Never, stergeti carduri active de dragu sa nu putem sa ne bucuram de bonusuri... sunteti de toata jena. Iar bonusurile/ premiile musai prin aplicatie, nu sunteti capabili sa le dati si prrin hartii/ coduri care sa fie scanate la casa, ca sa fie obligat oricine sa isi puna tampenia voastra de aplicatie, desi s-a plans lumea ca sunteti vai mama vostrA la acest capitol. RUSINE!!!! NU VA MERGE SERVERU CE DUMNEZEU NU INTELEGETI???? sept 2023: pt a cata oara imi stergeti cardul!!! | Не мога да се регистрирам Не работи | Doesn't work at all, pictures of the coupons just won't load and the app is therefore absolutely unusable for me. | Error 503 service temporarily unavailable | За да се възползваш от даден купон, те задължават да пазаруваш определен брой пъти в магазина въпреки, че човек има натрупани голям брой точки. | The leaf is not loaded,always. There is a message something like that Try again later | best | Non stop it not let me sing in in my account bad app | Very confusing UI. The leaflet / brochure never loads and just shows retry. | don't even start.... | Pictures aren't displayed always and this makes it hard to identify items with coupons despite having active mobile data connection or connecting to Wifi. The sorting of the items is bad and is very hard to find. It takes lot of time to scroll throught the different sections to find the exact product. The app is buggy and lags a lot | I was excited about the K-SCAN option, unfortunately, I had a very bad experience with it. An internet connection is required at all times, but there's no reception at the store in my area because of all the metal and no windows. The store does offer free wifi, but it's shaddy at best, with constant interruptions. I couldn't finish the process. Maybe offer an offline option? | I cannot for the love of God log in to my app because an unexpected error occurs apparently every time I try to log in via Google Account, this sucks majorly!!! | Two things: 1) Prices for many items in marketplace are different in app and browser - in app they are higher. 2) In marketplace some items are mislabeled, and if you want to buy something A3, and it says in the title A3, you receive A5. After complaint they claim it was A5 all along and update the title on website to counter your claim. When caught cheating - they offer 50% off next same purchase. Otherwise, as a helper for shopping in the store is really good, but avoid marketplace. | Worst app i've ever seen. I have to connect every time I use kscan. | Good app | Trash | bad app, always jump on home page, almost zero imformation | After latest update app logged me out and I cannot login. Lost all my progress, had to make new account. App developers should be sacked.

Tried reinstall. No avail. | Top, but don't make any mistakes, if you have to contact the support, alléluia....... | I am getting stuck on uploading document to confirm my identity...the app just says ""...please try again later"". Nowhere to call, nowhere to write... exactly what worries me about a ""mobile bank like this""... | Was an absolutely brilliant bank until their recent 'Fees' to withdraw your own money. They call it fair, I'd highly recommend you go elsewhere to the main banks where you can't get robbed of your own funds or forced to buy a plan. Disgusting behaviour from you Revolut, honestly disappointed. | Great | Not impressed. You say I have an account when it didn't complete the registration or load properly the first time so now my referee won't get his reward for inviting me to join!! | NOSTALGIE BRUSSEL LIVE 80'S | I get it, I need to set a longer password, but why block me when I really need to use the app, and I am not alone. From what it was a few years back, this app is getting worse, and so are the services. What's still missing is sports bets and video ads. Update: The account is not blocked, but a screen prevents performing any action until changing the password. I can briefly see how much I have in my account. | Ok | Just good init | Useful app for travel and paying in different currencies. | Excelent! | after today update the background crash disappeared, thank you for the fix. | Super ok | Wonderful | A fantastic app where you can handle your day to day living expenses as well as having access to crypto, commodities and stocks trading. Lots of benefits like cash back and travel perks etc. | I don't know why but I keep getting pop ups for Revolut not responding | Works so great for me, Easy setup. Able transact greatly | annoying ANR popup all the time | I like it, it's very convenient when to go to another country and pay in their currency with a good rate. Also easy to get funds and exchange for the currency of your choice | Great way not to carry too many CC's. | Love me revolut | Fast transactions, in crypto as well, works the best in all countries I visited with the lowest fees. | My account got restricted without any clear reason. I communicated with the support team and they haven't done a thing for over 1 month, and still asking me to wait!! | Excellent | Well done | Love the in app currency exchange and speed of international transfers as well as being able to spend in local currencies abroad | I like it because its very easy, useful I just hope it's secured | Easy to navigate | Good | Slow and useless | Amazing 🫡 | Good service | App certainly has grate features. I am concerned however with all the posts on accounts being closed and money blocked. There's too many floating around. A bank you cant trust with your money no matter the features, you just dont wanna use it. I only put a little at the moment cuz of the fear, which says a lot. | I like it, probably the best nano bank there is | My main account in FR & CH and to invest fun money. Easy-to-use, great features such as live notif on spending with good categorization, free card with easy config, FX rates 1% better than banks in my area. Basic but useful budgeting features and markets (yet more intuitive than most brokers apps). To improve: fix data export (often broken), add export of total value over time of portfolios. More flexible budgeting and analytics: manual entries, assign money split to a refund. | excellent service | Nice | Great for transfers for birthdays 🎂 | I like service and attention to details in the app architecture | Very useful. Works flawless. | Excellent service | Amazing | Excellent App | Perfect for eveything i need. | love Revolut, it has worked very well for me for years. | It's good and it's nice to use when your on holiday | Would recommend to anyone☺️ | Easy | Great | So far so good only few days in ,will know more once fully operational with DD an salary ,update done full switch have no idea what so ever if it's going through there is no info no updates no confirmation so not that great ,I don't know how long to wait either it's a gamble if my bills will bounce as no money be in my old account an no way of seeing what's happening in revolut regarding the full switch .update do not allow joint account so cannot switch . | The new rules are really bad, they want from you information from the other banks accounts you own. | Very good! Very useful | I can't add my citizen details. I vê tried to switch off my phone also but it still doesn't work. I must say that the team is really helping me out to sort my account and I really appreciate | Amazing | Not possible to verify my ID with my passport. 'Document Capture didn't work. Please try again'. I've tried this 1000 times. Nothing. | Scam .. Deposited money won't let me access even with correct pass code .. Send me junk emails but doesn't recognise my email for logging in purposes | Very good trading options | This app is in another level | Some times my card does nor working | Perfect modern online banking in every respect | Just loving it! | Can anyone tell me this card can be use in Taiwan? Is it that top up n use as credit card over there instead of converting to TWD dollars. Please | Excellent | Scam | Simple, effective, intuitive. You have access to many features in higher subscriptions and even in the basics you can find some of the best currency conversions. One of the best options for abroad use. | Great app and service. Only letdown is the appalling customer service: If you have an issue then you just get passed between bots. | App is nice, fx excahnge is really good. Trading keeps improving but still has outages on high volume periods. | Wish I could give zero stars. Worst experience I have ever had. Had my savings stolen from fraud/hacking/scam and everyone I spoke to was useless and they won't let me schedule a phone call and are very rude and inconsiderate. DON'T USE THIS BANK! | Quick and easy to use brilliant | Great, very handy for sharing costs of meals. 👍 | Revolut made significant efforts to improve the service which was a bit degraded at times in the past. They launched many new features which make them unique. | Beyond Excellent | Good app | A great way to bank and transfer. Much better than my main banking system. We'll done Revolut... | Easy to use and very secure | Good service | Excellent | Easy to use | Also starting to get regular messages that the revolut app has crashed. Must be some background service that is failing as from what I can tell, it doesn't appear to affect the functionality of the app. | 👍 | It doesn't accept my ID card and doesn't receive my report on this issue. I'm completely stuck | Powerful | Really good to del with and so convenient | Excellent | Cleaned my data & cache, then resigned in - and the app works again. Still, it's a very poorly design flow. | Very good | Sick | Brilliant for keeping track of spending and saving the loose change in the Vaults! So easy to use, would recommend highly!!!😊 | Revolut is a nice online bank ..... I love their services and is superb. | Happy | It's very good | Generally good. Convenient and informative. Would like to see a savings account introduction with an ECB interest rate not an Irish banking monopoly interest rate | Simple and easy to operate! | Everything is good about it | Pure garbage. I tried many times to sign-up.. using my phone number.. but I have never received the SMS with the code. I tried even by website. When I put the number it says: ""success"" but then it loads again the page.. and finish there.. nothing happens.. | Easy to use. In so many way's | Excellent and easy card for travel | Perfect finance tool! | Best secure banking ❤️ | Good good | Im unable to use the app, and im forced to change my passcode out of the blue | brilliant service | Convenient app. | Just try getting to speak to someone, or sending them a message. Waste of time! | After update asks me to set a new pass code and I never use that function, only biometrical login.. And now since the app goes to the change password screen I can't use.. Not even for contact support.. Fix this or at least give the option to contact support or any way to recover it.. | Today application referred to an updated security rules and start to force to change passcode from 4 to 6 digits without allowing to skip this step and use any other functionality. I tried 4 different combinations all with the same result operation forbidden. | Excellent thanks | Far exceeded my expectations. Probably the most useful app on my phone. Simple, practical, and works perfectly. Extremely useful for all travellers, both work and holiday. Thank you Revolut. | Pretty Good Tbh easy to use and navigate. I think preminum should be 4.99 not 7.99 maybe add a few more subscriptions but overall its not bad. | AI support is better then physical people... | Ordered card did not arrived, sending money to my main bank was taking multiple weeks and without help of other revolute user, i would not get my salary and died of starvation. (After some time) I reordered and did not used the card for over year as I learned how to only use online money and had different bank. My card got deleted | Long back and forth with tech support about not being able to receive payments from anyone, leading nowhere as I was constantly handed over from one tech support to the next, each one losing context of my issue. I emailed Revolut directly but got an automated response to use the in-app chat, which as detailed above was no longer an option. | Just started and so far is ok. | app keeps saying crashed even when i have forced closed it, getting stopped working warnings every 15 mins cant use my phone without uninstalling it. someone needs to lose their job | I changed the device, and I wasn't aware that I had to keep the old one. I locked out of the app, and there is no customer service assistance | very bad apps and service. I advise you not to subscribe. I signed up 7 month ago and my account still not verified. They got my money and I can't withdraw my money back. Rubbish | The best banking app ever. | Easy to use and ridiculously easy to setup. | Doesn't work on some machines especially in Tescos | It's safe to use. And I can make a dispute with less hastle if there's a mistake in sending. | The app runs properly again | Fast, user friendly | Been using Revolut since 2017 and wouldn't travel abroad without it. I upgraded recently to the Black metal card amd get free FT subscription plus can take £800 a month in cash in foreign currency free of charge.. | Great everything i want | Very good. Really like it. | Excellent account | Very good app, only thing is missing is to dpare change for joint accounts. | Nice | This app is not working on the Samsung s series, I tried for 2 days and it keeps crashing, it has a bug, and should be fixed. I can't even complete the profile setup, it won't continue the process! Its very bad app | Everything works quite good. I had a problem with recognizing my face from the front camera in order to change password. I had to take a picture only of the top part of my face to let me take the picture. | Awesome works well for me | Nice app ...works well easy to use nice design .. no issues | EXCELLENT customer service, so easy to use... win win. | Good investment | Changed bank here full time. No issues. | Amazing app | The app is very quick to respond and I can't think of anything that could be improved upon. | Works well for me, no issues | So far it's working well and I hope it continues | Awful. Absolutely awful. Need to selfie for pin but the camera button won't take photo. Not does the email with verification code come through. You're supposed to be easier than high street banks but you make my life misery with this woeful app and card. | Very simple to use. | I'm very satisfied, very useful and easy with adding money via GPay Also the money converting is so good. Cheaper than wise and instant. Amazing. | The best money app ever. | Love it.

Pintrest is so therepautic. I've used it since 4-5 yrs | Good;) | The site/app was been declining horribly for the past year. They’ve implemented Puritan guidelines — nothing even slightly sexual or violent/bloody (even fictional, things we see on TV every day), which they use to allow — that ruin it for us who use Pinterest for story inspiration. It's obvious that this is to rope in/cater to kids and conservatives, for the sake of more money. They've also been removing pins/boards/sections & accounts that don't even violate their new Puritan guidelines. | Pinterest practices censorship on a grand level. They are constantly removing pins that other users originally posted as well as removing entire boards and deleting the accounts of the users they censored for bogus reasons. And yet the offending pins are entirely appropriate and rarely fit the given reason for their removal. This is the kind of behavior one would expect from some sort of puritan cabal, dedicated to stripping users of their right to freedom of expression. | Çok iyi | This app is about everything!!!! 😍 | Very good | love it | I really like the app but whenever I create a pin I can't see it | I just downloaded it now I hope it will be great | Amazing and fun, although there are many updates that make the app worse/more difficult to use. Very laggy at times. I'm pretty satisfied and recommend it. | I love and enjoy all of my subscriptions and videos | Eu uso sempre e para tudo. | A fantastic app I love using it I would Recommend it to anyone | Excellent | Really cool. Love to use this app always | Just perfect | I don't know why but my organize button for my sections disappeared, so now I can't sort or move any pins which is really reallu annoying. | Very informative app and education. | Indeed 5 stars⭐❤️ | Good inspo pics | I've had this app for years and it is every day I use it almost every hr tbh. But lately, it's been so buggy and by the reviews, it seems everyone is having the same issues. Please fix this and bring back the old Pinterest 🙏🏼 the one that got people to download Bruh what is going on !!?!? U keep making this once great app worse and worse ! It's not even showing all. Y boards anymore when I wnat to save something. (2024) | Lame!!! Remember when pinterest was good? Now its just irrelevant ads. | Your app is not working well in my phone and it has stop working | I downloaded this app with a whole lots of difficulty and found it useless, as the app refused to open on my phone Phew 😫 | Impressive | Just love it and im from albania | Very good resource | Got a email about my appeals to things removed, while also being informed about having my appeals/submits being restricted if there's a pattern. First off idk what pic/videos I'm appealing, then to threaten/ intimidated me by restricting my movement is what I took from it. Can't email seeing there's no way to contact you guys, so if it comes to that don't give me or others the option to appeal then,don't make it be a quota filled than an option for members | Exeptional!!! I love this app so much! | This App has been hacked! | 👺 | I love Beomgyu🥹🎀 | Appbis good but the login form is slow | Too much | Very good application | ناررررر🌋💯 | Totally expectional | UPDATED 3/24/24 When is the auto save coming back??? IT IS VERY, HIGHLY INCONVENIENT THAT IS GONE!! I will most likely uninstall it from my phone, which I was on it throughout the day, personally and for work. Too bad I can't leave less than 1 Star.... I have updated the app, uninstalled, re-installed, over and over.... Still nothing. I used to be on this app EVERYDAY!!!! Now, I only use it on my computer because THAT'S what's more easy now!!!! Very ready to uninstall this for good!!!! | #everyone #hearingimpaired for def or disabled of hearing! | Good | Nice to be present here ! | I love that❤️ | The amount of promoted pins I see is getting ridiculous. I get it, I understand ads. But when I scroll through and I see an equal amount of promos vs regular content, or sometimes even MORE promos than regular content, it's gotten out of hand. This app was never supposed to devolve like this. It was supposed to be for creatives, for sharing recipes, for creating idea boards. I'm overwhelmed everywhere else by ads, you had to ruin Pinterest, too? | ❤️ | Nice | Best thing on the internet. Make your boards just as you wish. Add from a galaxy of subjects and images. Easy to do and extremely enjoyable. You can view each other's, with option to block abusives. Interests, beauty, images, recipes , how to, information. Everything! Would not be without Pinterest. | Says sign in with Facebook but there's no option for it. | It is very inspiring. | Great variety in a number of categories. | This is a great app i wanna only one thing that we should also able to download videos.

Didn't expect this from Pinterest it let us down | All goggle ads. Worthless app | Many times the notification i click on doesn't open. If i open the notification of a reply to a comment it barely opens.

Also, the main feed often does not match the photos and topics I follow. But anyway I enjoy this app | A wide ranging discussion forum.Iam particularly enjoying A year of War and Peace.This book is my life and I love seeing other peoples comments | Love it better than google | I love everything about Pinterest! Recipes, crafts, painting, designs, woodworking, dozens of projects!! I've been using Pinterest for years ❤️❤️ | Best non toxic app | Simply Awesome app. So very informative. | Good | Whenever I play any video validation error MSG come any solution? | It's taking way too long to load. It's to the point it won't load up at all | The app is quite fine but can't download images under wifi.. only data bundles Please improve it. | Nothing but ads | Datebayo ! | It's just a good thing, | Very good to find pretty things | Very nice | This app used to be cool, after each update a new issue appears. One of them..Massage pop up after downloading....it's really annoying. | Excellent | this app is always deactivated my account because of daily 5 to 6 pictures upload and they don't show any kind of information about the limits of pin 📍 | Wish to delete a message after sending it, by mistake, in chat. Plsss, thks | Superb | I love it | This is good app but this new update is very bad because I can't massage anyone please you solve the problem please 🙏 | love it so much 💕💕💕 | app good | 1-no option to delete conversation 2- also when we download picture suddenly share button pop out all sudden and by mistake already sent to stranger. | Like the DYI,pins are one of my favorite and I just like it's 😎 | Nice app | Great pics, love looking up new ideas. | Good appp | this app has helped so much with edits my first reviews this should help check out the app | Wicked algorithm. Edit: changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. You deleted my board with thousands of pins over the years with no notification. My home feed is no longer wicked, showing me pins I have zero interest in despite constantly tuning my feed this past week. Not to mention the website is now flooded by AI art. I see this is going to same way as Tumblr did years ago. No thanks. What a damn shame, you had something special Pinterest. Closing account. | Ads breaking image scroll almost every two set on images. Three advertisements placed side by side blocking 90% of row. Constant requests for user input upon such ads. Uninstalled and would not recommend. | Beautiful easy patterns for baby girls | Love this app!!! | It's a great app | It's a 5* app really, my favourite social media app, if indeed it should be called that. But it has a very irritating habit of not accepting updates, and leaving a link in the Google Play update list that doesn't do anything. This looses it three stars. | Op | I hava h very good experience with pinterest. Very good aap | This app is very good and I suggest you download it🦋💅 | Good app | Love the recipes and hair ideas. | I like very much but the videos which you have u can't download it | I love this app | Cool 😎 app | Not my type | Can you please add the unsend message feature? Your app is so prone to it. Especially, it's so easy to send a message and there are so many times I accidentally send a message to a total stranger... Please, fix this. | Getting worse as time goes by. Bad content and too many ads | Love Pinterest has great interest in everything | Its mostly adds and i keep seeing things that arent relavent to me. Edit: I can't pin pins anymore?? I can't even use the app for its purpose.

Pinterest is awesome 😎 | Very good | Help centre is absolutely useless. | This is a nice app | they show things that I'm interested in | Pinterest removes or changes fundamental functional features consistently more than any other website I've ever encountered. Wish they would stop. Latest complaint can't organize pins or see ""more like"" in board sections, only main boards. 99% of my pins are in sections. App is fine, I enjoy the long-press to pin/edit functionality. Wish that the website as a whole would focus less on favoring branded content and shopping, search is essential no longer useful bc of this. But what can you do. | Dope | Bekar hai pinterestv💩 | Pinterest has a wide variety of basically *almost* EVERYTHING on photos and shorts.

Thx u | I Love being able to save my dreams! I will never get thru all of them, but I can still Dream! | I have used Pinterest for years. It has been my go-to for anything from recipes to home renos, vacations to fashion ideas. In recent months, it has become absolutely unusable. There are 20 ads for every one non‐ad. It's beyond ridiculous. I can't find new ideas due to their algorithms. If you save anything, you only get 146 more recommendations of the same idea. I don't see ideas from people I follow anymore. Everything now comes with a garbage bonus click-bait title, too. This is so sad to me. | I love making a lot of difrunt arts and crafts, pintest inspiring me and given me a lot of ideas Thanks ,keep going | Love all the new ideas | I use this app to find crochet patterns, yummy recipes, & activities for my grandkids. | The ads are getting really excessive. I had to scroll 3 times to get past an entire wall of ads. There were like 8 or 9 of them clustered together and not a single original pin in between.

But now it is impossible to open a link, when I choose \""visit\"" button. Also I tried several times to add some new photos as pins and the app changed the racio from portait to square and the quality became extremely blur. For now I will not add any pins, waiting for resolving the issues."",""When I try searching for similar images it doesn't work and just shows a \""heads up\"" message. That's extremely frustrating. Also every time you save something, the annoying message pops up, and there's a list of random people you \""might want to send\"" the picture to, so I accidentally pressed it and send a message to a random person and couldn't even delete it"",""I have used Pinterest for years. It has been my go-to for anything from recipes to home renos, vacations to fashion ideas. In recent months, it has become absolutely unusable. There are 20 ads for every one non‐ad. It's beyond ridiculous. I can't find new ideas due to their algorithms. If you save anything, you only get 146 more recommendations of the same idea. I don't see ideas from people I follow anymore. Everything now comes with a garbage bonus click-bait title, too. This is so sad to me."",""Good app, but sometimes it glitches. For instance, I'll be scrolling through some images and all of a sudden one of the images will be cropped halfway and another image will appear on the other half and it will be slanted. It typically happens when i leave the and then come back on. I find it very strange and I hope it will be fixed soon since I had this problem in around January, and despite all the updates, this still hasn't been fixed."",""I don't ever write reviews but I felt this app needed one. I've used Pinterest for around 6 years and it was one of my favorite apps ever. However, slowly there have been ads taking over the app, and as of today it's impossible to actually scroll through and find something good. It is completely full of ads. You could scroll for 10 minutes and only see 10 posts related to your search, but 40 ads along the way. Love the app but I can't find anything anymore but ads.""]",false,false,false,"com.pinterest","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Jsem překvapený | instalace proběhla bez problémů a nahrané informace jsou správné. aplikace je obecně stabilní. letos bychom měli vidět více nahraných dokladů a rostoucí počet míst, kde se aplikace používá. funkčnost je jednoduchá a tak by to mělo zůstat, nicméně design obrazovky je velmi minimalistický, kde se vše jednoduše rozplývá v bílém pozadí. to je samozřejmě věc vkusu, ale možná by bylo možné do designu přidat státní symboly / barvy se záhlavím a zápatím formuláře. Určitě krok dobrým směre | Aplikace jako taková je fajn, uvidíme, co až se bude používat. Ale ten počátek byl fakt frustrující. | Funguje bez problémů | Nelze pouzivat, nikde | Tlačítka nereagují, app je zatim nepouzitelna | Mohli byste do popisu aplikace pridat odkaz, kde lze digitalni obcanku aktualne pouzit?

Nebo jenom daně musím zaplatit? | Když si aplikaci na pozadí spustím tak nevyžaduje přihlášení PIN, na homescreen se mi zobrazuje doklad ve spodní části a v horní je tak zbytečně prázdno, při přihlášení přes bankovní identitu mi aplikace nahlásila že jsem byl odhlášen a když jsem reopnul aplikaci tak registrace byla dokončena | Nefunguje načtení eobcanky, pokud QR kód skenuji o 180% otočený | Perfektní, na obchodě Play popis aktualizace, aplikace funguje jak má. | Puvodne jsem uvedl ""Az to bude fungovat, rad to zksuim...

Vcera to jiz proslo, ale stejne nejde nic dal udelat. Po otevreni aplikace to jen napise ""nastal problem s pripojenim obcanky"" a tim koncime. Takze zatim nepouzitelne. | Super. Registrace hotova za 1-2 minuty. Vše bez problému. Těším se na další postup v digitalizaci. Děkuji. | EDIT1: O dva updaty aplikace pozdeji: Pokus o registraci = chyba 10000.

Toto je přitom jediné zařízení, na kterém se o registraci neúspěšně pokouším, a v Portálu občana žádná registrace vedena není. | Pozor, pro registraci vyžaduje v zařízení instalovaný prohlížeč Chrome! Bez něj nelze provést registraci. Pro vývojáře: V každém mobilu existuje pro tyto účely WebView, neměli byste volat přímo Chrome. | Patrně to dopadlo nejhůře jak mohlo. Potíže bych chápal, ale již tři dny nejsou dostupné prakticky žádné systémy. Těžko tedy institucím věřit, že jsou schopné data spravovat. Prý mám zaregistrované 2 doklady na jiném zařízení a měl bych je odstranit z portálu občana. Tam však nic není (pokud se to vůbec dostanu). Pouze zbytečná zpráva o nové éře prokazování (trefné). | Aplikace je dobře navržená z hlediska UI a poměrně srozumitelná na použití, ale jelikož už autentizaci přes Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu mám nastavenou už z dob covidu, tak jsem byl přihlášený prakticky okamžitě. Problémy se servery už naštěstí opadly. | Top. Konečně super nápad♥️👌 Staženo ještě den předem takže jsem se vyhl problémům s registrací. Spokojenost | Co víc dodat než jednu hvězdičku a i ta je moc | Aplikace funguje. To, jak se kdo tváří a kdo občanku v eDokladech (ne)přijímá už je věc další a za ní aplikace nemůže. | Neviditelný status bar, nefunkční back button, hromada bugů, ... studenti by to udělali líp | Hezu, tapuju na tlačítko ""registrovat se"" avšak se nic neděje:) | Love the look and overall state of the application | Pecka !! | Piráti, díky 🙏😄😁!!! | Funguje. Registrace již v pátek 19.01. večer, v pondělí 22.01. jsou pak údaje stále bez problému přístupné. | Že aplikace ma offline režim, a ten jen funguje, kdyz si vypnu mobilni data je absolutně stupidní. | Funguje spolehlivě, alespoň bude tlačit zbytek egov kupředu. Vlastně mě jen rozčiluje pomalé načítání a poskakující úvodní logo (mění pozici i velikost než dojde k zobrazení dialogu na otisk) | Nefunkční | Díky za snahu o zlepšení digitalizace v ČR! Těším se, až přibudou i další doklady, možná nejen ty vydávané státními institucemi? 🤩 Aplikace ale má ještě mouchy. Zdaleka největší je ukrutná pomalost, i v offline módu trvá i přes deset vteřin, než se uživatel vůbec dostane k přihlášení – nechápu důvod, určitě by šlo zlepšit. Z okna ""Prokázat se"" nefunguje tlačítko ""Zpět"" (intuitivní ovládání v Android); stisknutí křížku ""×"" funguje, ale je také nepochopitelně pomalé, několik vteřin se nic neděje. | 👌 10/10, snadné, rychlé, nepadá | Funguje. | Po přihlášení přes AirBank app, černá obrazovka. | Jednoduché rozhraní a funguje 👍 | 21 století je tu! :) Jen škoda, že se stát standardně nepoučil, co se týče spuštění, mohli jste si ušetřit špatné PR. | ""Nejsme schopni dokončit Váš požadavek."" Jak jinak. Registrace nefunguje ani přes bankovní identitu, ani přes Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu. Jak jsem mohl čekat něco jiného. Kántry fór da fjúčr. | Nefunguje už třetí den po sobě | Neskutečné chyby v aplikaci při registraci občanky, dodnes nevyřešeno. Ve web portále vidím dva! eDoklady, jeden nejde odstranit, proto asi nejde registrace. Tu apku NIKDO netestoval! | Nefunkční. Různé chyby, různé kroky, ale registrace nefunkční. | Aplikace k nám přijela z roku 2013. Dostali jsme krásnou react native aplikaci, která možná funguje, možná ne. Všude máme černé pruhy abychom byli v bezpečí a nevěděli kolik máme notifikací nebo kolik je hodin. Aplikace taky nevypadá stejně jako na screenshotech, což je vždycky dobrá známka. | Katastrofa. Nelze se registrovat. Nefunkční. | Nefunguje registrace dokladů | Tlačítko registrace vůbec nereaguje. Takže aplikace nejde použít. | Příjemně mě překvapilo, třeba o možnosti ověřit cizí doklad jsem se dozvěděl až po stažení. UI nevypadá až tak zle (viz web ministerstva vnitra). Na druhou stranu bych měl i několik důvodů proč strhnout dvě hvězdičky. Prvně vůbec nechápu loading time, je záhadně dlouhý (optimalizace). Za druhé mi trochu vadí, že to není open-source. A poslední třetí poznámka se vztahuje k dnešnímu výpadku, ten mi ani tak nevadí, pokud se nebude opakovat, ale chybělo mi tu tlačítko na offline mode. Bez dat to šlo | Nainstalovano, sparovano, duvody na pozadavek udeleni opravneni vysvetleny, navigace jednoducha - za me dobra prace a posun statu spravnhm smerem. Diky! | Registrace přes bankovní identitu. Během minuty hotovo. | Jediné plus asi, že to jde spustit a nevypne se přitom telefon. Nic jinýho ta aplikace neumí. | Je vidět, že České úřady jsou jako vždy připraveny na to, že se někdo rozhodne využívat jejich elektronických služeb. | Za me dobry az na par detailu. Problemy s prihlasenim se vyresi az nebude takovy napor novych uzivatelu. Ale proc ten QR kod na prokazovani se nacita 2 vteriny, ackoliv jde nacist i offline, takze to neni kvuli odezve backendu. Kdyz chci jit z prokazovani zpet, tak nefunguje back button a musim hledat krizek po obrazovce jak na iphonu. To same kdyz chci odejit z aplikace. Back button nic nedela. Tmavy mod by taky byl super. | Up to now, not working. | V aplikaci zatím vidím víc chybových hlášek, než dokladů. Přihlášení se nedařilo (15000) Nápad dobrý, provedení bohužel drahé a mizerné. | Stale nefunguje registrace pomoci identity obcana. Proc publikujete neotestovanou aplikaci? Je stejne neotestovane i jeji zabezpeceni? Vsak jde jen o hlavni doklad k identifikaci, statni sprava, no stress :-( | Nefunguje přihlášení | ""Registrace pomocí Identity občana se nezdařila 10000"" Tak po dni, kdy se registrovat nedalo vůbec, kvůli přetížení serverů mi vyjela tahle nic neříkající chyba. | Ještě přidat dark mode a bude to supr😊 | Na toto jsme roky čekali. Obcanka se sparovala bez velkeho usili jen přihlášením do banky, to jsem ani necekal ze bude tak snadne. | Digitální občanka... Co víc si přát. | Podařilo se mi zaregistrovat bez problémů a funguje dobře, hned dnes vyzkouším co mi na to v baru řeknou | Doklad se nepodarilo nahrat, zkusit znovu nepomaha. | Doklady se nepodařilo aktualizovat. | Great initiative but unintuitive onboarding process. Once it's done, good. | Funguje na první dobrou, nainstalováno a aktivováno během dvou minut. | Aplikace nefunguje, při přihlášení přes MojeID ukáže chyba 10000. | S aplikací jsem spokojen, funguje bezproblémově na Rootnutých zařízení / Zařízení s vlastním OS což je dle mého názoru velké plus, že se nemusí nic obcházet. Jen ty problémy s registrací no, příště by to chtělo zvednout kapacitu serverů | Nefunkcni, nelze se prihlasit bankovni identitou. Zkusil jsem nekolikrat, vzdy ""nejsme schopni dokoncit pozadavek"" | Funguje to tak jak má. Prostě elektronická občanka. | Zatím se nenaskytla možnost využití v praxi, nicméně prvotní přihlášení a zobrazení identifikačních údajů zatím bez problému. :)) Přijde mi trošku zvláštní, že jsem se přes nastavení mohl na jedno kliknutí zapsat do registru ověřovatelů a nyní tedy asi můžu začít kontrolovat doklady, i když k tomu nemám vlastně žádný zákonný důvod. Ale když nad tím tak přemýšlím, tak je to asi takto lepší, než kdybych musel posílat papírovou úředně ověřenou žádost kamsi na Vnitro... | Čekal jsem, že když dám Registrovat pomocí bankovní identity, tak se mi otevře bankovní aplikace, kde se otiskem prstu přihlásím a bude hotovo. Místo toho vidím embedded prohlížeč, kam mám vyplňovat jméno a heslo do banky - krásná příležitost pro phishing. Jsem trochu zklamán. | Vypada použitelně. Na žádný z obrazovek nefunguje systémové tlačítko zpět. UI by chtělo trochu vizuálně doladit pozadí agresivně přetéká do lišty zatím co nad ""Doklady"" je zbytečná mezera - jako by tam něco chybělo). A chybí nějaké tlačítko možnosti zpětné vazby přímo v aplikaci aby ty drobnosti člověk nemusel psat sem. | Funguje | Funkční, pěkné a především jednoduché a intuitivní! Teď ještě vyřešit zmatení mezi eObčankou a eDoklady (kde mám občanku) a bude to top :) | Vše funguje jak má | Registrace se nezdařila | jednoduchá a moderní aplikace | Intuitivní, přehledné. | Chyba 10000 při registraci, nefunkční aplikace, doporučuji prozatím nestahovat a ušetřit si nervy s nefunkčním přihlášováním | Excellent application. The first impression is very good. | Bohužel, nefunguje. Nedaří se Registrace ani přes Bank.identitu ani Mobilní klíč - žádná chyba, jen černá stránka. | Nelze se ověřit přes Datovou schránku. Nepoužitelnost v zahraničí, nutnost tedy neustále nosit plastovou. | Spustili aplikaci, ale chodili jim tam lidi... | ověření a první párování bankovní identitou je peklo. 2023-01-20 přihlášení se nepovedlo chyba 15000 (Fio banka) | Aby bylo mozne pouzit je treba mit nastavene zamykani telefonu. Telefon potrebuji k praci. Takze 2 moznosti - muzu mit pouzitelny telefon, ale ne s obcankou a nebo muzu mit digitalni obcanku, ale bez telefonu. Jak to resi jine aplikace? | Prihlaseni pomoci bankovni identity funguje bez problemu, tak jen pockat az to pujde vsude pouzivat :) | Funguje jak má. | Super aplikace | Na první dobrou mám občanku v mobilu, teď ještě počkat než mě zkontroluje nějaký strážník 😅 | Paráda lidi, funguje. Propojit fakt snadný a už můžu vyběhnout ven jen s telefonem. Díky moc, tohle je fakt posun dopředu. PS: Extra body designérům. Barvy občanky a pixel art lev na QRku. Skvělý! První dojmy nad očekávání. | Jednoduché přihlášení přes portál občana s mobilním klíčem; vše přehledné a srozumitelné; luxusní ikona u UI. Nemůžu se dočkat, až se služba zítra spustí a budu moci někde vyzkoušet. | funguje | Neintuitivní, bez instrukcí... | Nemám vesměs co vytknout, možná jediný co, tak údaje které chci sdílet by bylo snazší si vybrat předtím, než se spojím s ověřovatelem a ne až potom, co to spojení navážu. Jinak super, ani bych neřekl, že to je státní aplikace. :-)) | Ach jo. Kluci verim ze mate na vic. Spousta blikajicich webview? Banery prekryvajici texty v aplikaci? Nedynamicka ikona? O DM si take muzeme nechat zdat? Vzdyt to je zadarmo kdyz to pisete nove a nativne. Proc je hlavni stranka defakto prazdna a jen dole maly obrazek zadni stranky obcanky? K cemu je kopirovani kazde polozky na me obcance? To nevim jak se jmenuji a tak abych si to mohl zkopirovat do schranky? Aplikace se neda ukoncit back buttonem? Proc je vyhozeny status bar? Ach jo. | Aplikace by mohla nastavovat barvu informací ve statusbaru momentálně je to černé na černém pozadí | Works great, looks great, welcome to 21st century Czechia. 👏🎊🍾 | Vypadá to funkčně a zdá se být intuitivní 👍 jen tak dál.","{""1"":893,""2"":180,""3"":159,""4"":320,""5"":732}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"10","10","VARY","Digitální a informační agentura","Digit%C3%A1ln%C3%AD+a+informa%C4%8Dn%C3%AD+agentura","edoklady@dia.gov.cz","https://edoklady.gov.cz",,"https://gov.cz/tiraz/osobni-udaje-a-cookies","Digit%C3%A1ln%C3%AD+a+informa%C4%8Dn%C3%AD+agentura","Tools","TOOLS","[{""name"":""Tools"",""id"":""TOOLS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tCTyxBee6Rnu6MjhBWKN1Esy-K9tCRgGTJLhSyDhENfsM1D7kE4aWSdtwbpcS1aguw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DsZCSo1w-ltIscle_fbYBkr_LvkfFo5golNkFvl2cAQXG_WBRd4u3u6RD554gVKtYhE","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HPwaZnF7sCZVHtZh73HktalcZSI2OuWRXelKfWmW6s90s2Dmel-MQvXzcYk5pFtUKg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uET2UOoE8RT9LVUVoSQGhkRDSmTnEKnZPiAx5dUbnYcmqqg4aPtH1ZYHPzHIEkBZgI99"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/K-EMbK3JQZVol-IISiadGEXXzHyZ4Eb9tCvNDw6LybGQtnK2kyHpyp4eu_4yYRNeQIA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-ssUdDDAEhGGLXdoOwrkhrntO7fnlMpy3-WxUhzgYXYaW_13aXkAg7q8MaUZVnLL8g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bpNGwbxLtf2AvHv7VuvILLR6dKPDhxbjiiJE_XSuVPdUzLfcHTSteBlJ279PX_Ixh5PY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/66ZqDCvYwlmXQy472aUvRSQKLBW3tdC_fbeVlj7gYRLtVpapn8K3Hjc4cmMTGoBi4Kc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zh3K97pMof1ilgmfAQkUWNgwUjeurx8t1o7Ql5mXsXerQUHJd_KTYbnRYvbLRPxEVI8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/m-4kawptu2ZtxalaE_n_gGQ1iu91C-FyLibxZUgU0198f9ZeSb9_1CqjoJAQq4Q4QQc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ahiW8QCNd5Ym5y4rQ0EVZDXqCOPRshmR9AuRdUOxyhha8-p-obqzeNV_27ZkWMBNk0o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TKBban8JgCaN4-X6KANBBpG_ZCcxn7vfaY_XBBqcoGYIYtIxElwG7qaMnkFrKKQdbQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/csysiLkfzlmPPux-0QPAIzNKhQqXfaLxSW5N-88dGSs0p154Sws5v88H8qIrXlKVilY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DyblqaF9wiJ-1lKaHPVBrobQO-Ow9x5zllVkZyQIiN_hrfAfMLlsxWqqY7DPl0xYVA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lsNY5OgRnlFFUb-DGwC6U__4k-vo1fLOn3-uMpsPyzVXPNCS6jauGBb3WCX1hDNwAkM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pSNSG3KESqNe138A0Ijah11g1WaKEKp0cFAOn5KCu58tfIhP33NJVa1_QxyvzpX7UURH"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/efTc5Gp3izcwjTagAVBPUck4k5DOJGCHsQB68XbUvZtX2ZHdxHuxn7tnLMn3pFH2Cls"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qx_PLIwC09-mXXJuKUJsj93aYnFSeyvAW64uVF_RKvsDckFcvyLAIu3YeH4ykBTlIw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PCceXB6MWO2OExbFoaLhvP35zgqRN6sW9P9Fd0N3pZtPc57ntxX4xO7ECmJHzmhxNJI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9ZYskzkFlWbYK9YuqXe0CQnRGhWIX8IECr6w7LJVStZZDwVlW2MTp3L9w_facK_LBQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H88VP0xpUot6bTXR1XK0dOa-CRi4z0hvimTNMiMI7UY9MuTiqWh6eVccHLktLv7A5A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1fSnYGPiEUzE5tfeTRIDYw5n7n-0Y_zTpdAmtfG_Wh_cgqXW7NYFHCntEka9g-n0a0I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xYoAHcn3pMajKFGekEKdUNWc68HKig9VCsbuNc8Qq8Yg2cO0Eqs8iuYUREw5kVK9HzCK""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Nov 13, 2023",1706626093000,"1.0.3","- oprava opětovného připojení dokladu v případě zrušení registrace<br>- textové a vizuální úpravy","[""Afrr the initial launch problems, the app seems to work just fine.

Disfunctional chatbot. Cannot download invoices. Fraudulent. | Magenta Moments jsou skvělým zpestřením, bohužel si aplikace nepamatuje na kterou soutěž jsem již odeslal svůj hlas a lze tedy soutěžit (neúmyslně) i opakovaně 😐. | It's quite great with its benefits etc. But please STOP charging my credit if there's not enough for a recurring plan. The balance is then negative and it's so annoying! Of course I can disable recurring but it's also annoying to do it each time. | Nothing you cannot do on the web other than rare special offers. The company is not nice and the prices are through the roof. | After reinstalling I don't see any crashes. However, this app does not accept standard payment methods such as VISA cards or Google pay to top up credit. | Widget funguje jen chvíli | Velmi nepřehledná a vizuálně ošklivá aplikace. Zmatky vytvořené aplikací mi způsobily nezaplacené účty za které jsem pak museli připlácet 500 za ""vymáhání"", i přestože mi jen přišla SMS. Docela drahý SMSky tím pádem. Platit za vaše chyby mi přijde dosti na hlavu. | appka tuhne, nevidim nabidky, ktery nejsou pro me a tak nemuzu upgradovat, jelikoz nevim, co ziskam testoval to. nekdo? #$&(¥€π×§∆π√ | Nice one | UX absolutní nula - jdu do ""plateb"" a mám zobrazené ""žádné nezaplacené"" i přestože v ""under process"" jich mám spoustu. Chodí mi pouze SMS, kde je nekopírovatelný číslo účtu. Očekával bych, že přesně pro tohle aplikace je - abych klientovi jasně ukázal kolik nezaplatil a jednoduchý způsob platby. V tomto vaše služby a atato aplikace katastrofálně selhává. | V aplikaci mi chybí nastavení ""Nepřeji si být obtěžován tou blbou krávou z T-Mobilu co mi 2x měsíčně volá s nějakou debilní nabídkou!"" | Poor app, I can't pay my billing in this app. | Nova uprava nicmoc, neprehledne, male | Nice | One of the last updates broke navigation within the app that leads to freezing the phone screen. | Loading is pretty slow! (Already 3 years of struggle with this problem, good job!) Now they added notifications about ""nothing"". You can turn them off via phone settings, but this kind of thing should be off by default. Why? Because the notifications are about ""please open your app, you can check this and that there!"" Of course I can check it there, that's why I have it.. give me some special offer or stop spamming idiotic messages about what your app can do.. | Updated on 24 Sept and the new versions is enormously bloated. The app looks more like carnival than a comfortable tool. | Když už aplikace vyžaduje při každé aktualizací znovu přihlášení, tak by mohla aspon spolupracovat s password managerem (když už teda nenabízí dnes běžně možnosti odemčení biometrikou a zapamatování účtu). | Very slow unreliable, I cannot open it even when I have unlimited data. Some time it is not easy to login. Developers should make a lightweight fast application without bloated advertisements and it must be user-friendly. I rate Tesco mobile application with 5 stars. I know what is a good application. Now I don't see add on options. | You are a big company of thieves who are officially stealing from each and every one of your customers | Small bug fixes, that's nice, but it would be nice to fix important bugs, like WiFi manager not working.

Šetří čas i peníze. | Useful and easy-to-use app, unfortunately a bit buggy and slowly loading. It also forces you to update it periodically, which is very annoying and intrusive! | Good everything works | Excellent app. Keep up the good work ✌️ | Supeeer! | Krasa | Good | Ok | Works well | Hmmm. Da Da d daa. | Super appka | So far so g%d | zoufalá apka, zoufalé ""služby“, tuny spamu, ripoff ceny, nesmyslné aktualizace, hromady nevyžádaných hovorů s naprostým junkem, ostudná předpotopní organizace | Good but Slow | Vše co je inovativní je orientováno na zkušenosti zákazníků s aplikací a tím tzv. potřebným. Velice dobrá práce. Díky vám za to a hodně úspěchů do budoucna. | It's a ""happy app"", the dialogue is friendly and fun to use. | Apka je přehledná a nabízí spoustu možností, jediný co bylo zvláštní, že při volbě nového tarifu se mi zobrazovala nabídka 3 tarifů, ale v prohlížeči na webu bylo na výběr z daleko více možností.... To by chtělo upravit, aby i v apce byl stejný výběr.. | I use it sparsely. It is not complicated app and quite user friendly. | Pretty good | Very good app. I recommend | Ok boomer. | Spolehlivá, user friendly appka 😉 | Everything you need | Love it! | Vše je přehledné, j aplikaci jsem spokojená | It's very easy to pay through the app, you can see nice and easy how much data you used. Perfect! | Vrátila jsem se k vám na konci loňského roku a jsem překvapená, jak velmi se T-Mobile změnil k lepšimu. Ve všech směrech: technologicky - vaše apka je skvělá, ve službách - jednání se zakazníky, poradenství, jednání se zákazníky ... naprosto bezkonkurenční! Gratuluji a přeji celému týmu T-Mobile další zákazníky, stejně spokojené jako jsem já. Uspokojení z práce, to je dobrý tým, spokojení klienti a skvělé výsledky. A to všechno vy máte. Díky! Marie Hofmannová | 😊 | Nejlepší aplikace na spravování svého tarifu či kreditu | Great | Kratom | Aplikace otravuje obchodními sděleními a nenašel jsem možnost jak to vypnout. Jedině je vypnout na úrovni os, čímž přijdu i o těch několik užitečných. Nezobrazuje ani zbývající rychlá data u neomezeného balíčku. | 👍❤️❤️❤️ | 👍 good | app logged me out automatically and after next login app shows different tarif than before, no one from support is able to solve or at least explain this | Dobrý ale, dodatečné datové balíčky je možné platit pouze kartou a jednodušší způsob aby se odečetli na faktuře není možný. Nepochopitelné.... | I can't even log in after they logged me out of this app, seriously so bad apk | It has only one widget. This widget is even not possible to adjust, for example it doesnt show remaining minutes and sms. Every time I look at the widget I have to refresh it to see any information at all. It is impossible to find a way how to remove mobile number ""connected service"". Required updates suck.... | Za dlouhodobě téměř nenastavitelný widget hvězdička dolů(možná dám časem i druhou dolů, protože je to hlavní funkce, kterou od apky požaduji). Aplikace je jinak fajn a jednoduchá. Prosím o vylepšení widgetu (zmenšení rozměrů, průhlednost a hlavně zobr. více služeb najednou na jednom widgetu), pak dám rád 5 hvězdiček. 05/23: Tak widget se sice o malinko zmenšil, zato k horšímu, protože na něm vůbec nelze zobrazit jiné služby, než jediná náhodně zvolená služba. Proč? | 06/23: Update nic nezměnil. | Super | Je tam jen jeden obrovský widget (4x2), který nejde zmenšit. Čekal bych jich více a i menších (1x1) -například pouze s info o zbývajícím objemu dat. | Fix your stupid app, I'm tired of having to pre-install it every time it says "" Something went wrong, try again later"". | App is super buggy, when trying to pay I rather use the web app (although that is not better) | I cannot access my account in tmobile, i already go to different tmobile shops they dont know how to fix | Forced update way too often. Refuses to be used to pay the bill even if the update log just says some minor bug fixes. *The point is not that the pay woumd not work, the point it says an update is necessary and refuses to work without.* Even when the log just says minor bug fixes. Obviously reinstall does fix that but suggesting it as a fix is nonsensical. | Something good | Horrible, I cancelled the subscription because EU is not single tel zone anymore, but still getting charged for non using telephone | AGBAPPCZ | Aplikace je super. Ale otravuje mě ""odhlášení z bezpečnostních důvodů"". Nevidím k tomu důvod, žádný bezpečnostní problém jsem neměl. Zbytečně to komplikuje používání aplikace. | fakt spatnyyy | Buggy and not localized. Most of the pages are in Czech even though my language preference is set to English. It's slow and most of the things throw errors. In spite of that, it's the best way to check remaining data and to make payments (whenever they work). | Good and cinvinient App | omg so much like avlada | Its a good app but I hate the low quality of the app's logo | I love this application. It's easy to use, it is full of easter eggs and so on. Its customers in this app are able to activate a lot of benefits, as summer break mobile data etc. You can participate in contests with electronic prizes in general, however I've never won before, but it's fun to participate. It's only pitty that the support bot isn't such excellent and doesn't support custom replies. After all for me it's the best application of the best cellular telecom in Czechia. I recommend it! | Po dnešním updatu přestali fungovat srdcovky. Zobrazuje to stejnou chybu: err unknown url scheme. Stejný výsledek i na druhým telefonu s androidem. | Should have better English options | Im a foreigner in Czech, using Tmobile and its practically nightmare to get more internet on it. | No úplně na picu. | Nepouzitelny kus hna. Zakoupim simku instaluji aplikace a po 2 hodinach nemám nic. Cislo se nedá přidat. Takže do popelnice simkartu a zpet do O2 | Okay ish Dejte si facku za to, že když Vám dojde internet přes SIM, tak Vas to nepustí na internet přes aplikaci a nenechá Vás to koupit víc internetu nebo dobít kredit. Aplikace má mít přístup k internetu i když Vam zaplacený došel.... | Nabídky v apce vůbec neodpovídají mému tarifu. Žádnou nemůžu využít, ale přesto jich tam vidím spousty. | I OWN THE RIGHT | Goof | Nice | Not able to refill card with non czech credit card. Have to buy a new sim card and switch phone numbers every time.. | good | Unfortunately T-mobile isn't a good company anymore, they change their plans and ask you to pay more without your permission here is their message: Dear customer, as part of the improved tariff offer we have prepared new tariffs with new prices for you. We will move you to one of these tariffs on 20.11.2022. These tariffs of the new generation are full of further benefits. Are you interested in what benefits you get and what will be the price of your tariff? And they are higher tariffs, Shame | Xobre | It works. However, it is incredibly slow and consumes a lot of data to open it. | Apart from occasional loading issues, requiring clearing cache, the app has seen an improvement in both content and features. | Neuvěřitelně pomalé a obtížná orientace v aplikaci. Aplikace startuje 5-10 vteřin (pomalejc než třeba youtube), widget se vždy dlouho načítá. Sice člověk po otevření aplikace vidí kolik má využitých dat, ale zobrazení počtu zbývajících minut či sms se musí složitě proklikat. Widget taky zobrazuje pouze data (když zrovna funguje). | The app is not working from 23:00 to 3:00 with explanation: ""servers need to rest too"" which is complete nonsense because of this I have to rate it one star until this issue is resolved. | Unable to use foreign card for top up? Never seen that before .. quite disappointed | Při vyzvednutí odměny za dobití dojde k pádu aplikace. Při vymazání Cache a uživatelských dat, dojde také k pádu aplikace po přihlášení a pokusu o vyzvednutí odměny. | This is good app | Když aplikace funguje tak funguje dobře, bohužel mi už několik měsíců padá hned při startu :/ | Impossible to login | Aplikace si vynucuje ukladani platebne karty, pritom to vypada ze neni zabezpecena ani proti vytvoreni screenshotu citlivych udaju. Na 4 krat jsem kartu zadaval (30 min) ... Dale popis balicku ""jednorazov"" a ""opakovane"" dobiti kreditu je v aplikaci stejny !!! To mam hledat na internete abych se dozvedel v cem je rozdil? ----- 2Veronika: Dakujem za informaciu, podstatne vsak je aby sa to objavilo v aplikacii ... davam 2. hviezdicku aspon za rychlu odpoved. | Great | Appka funguje ok, ale poměrně časté odstávky jsou dost otravné. | ok | Love T-Mobile | Už nedávají neomezené data na léto. | Rubish app | Nefunguje nenačítá se i když mám wi-fi | Awful, cannot login using mobile phone number. Requires valid ServiceID in mobile phone field, what this should mean for me? Absolutely unintuitive Finally logged in, but still very useless error information. Guess this goes more to company itself, not to application. To developers: consents activity layout is terrible, buttons to approve with consents is mostly out of the screen, text cannot be seen at all, it was kinda a puzzle to press the button and go forward. | It keeps stopping....I need to pay the bill!!!! | I find it unbelievable that I am not able to install this app outside Czech republic. What's up with that? I am a long time Tmobile customer who lives overseas and regularly visits my family in Czech. Yet I can't excess my account. Please explain me the reasons and please remove the pointless restrictions. Thank you | Usually have problems with convection. My request can not be processed. It happens so often that I need to get extra megabytes but application is not able to get the data and let me purchase bundle | no more free stuff 1/5, constant updates for no obvious reason, app? more like crapp | Vnucená aktualizace přinášející nové zbytné funkce a pouze ""drobné opravy"" | Hard to use for foreigners, English version isn't working, half time it's still Czech. Not intuitive, I struggle everytime to find what I need. | Aplikace doteď super, ale po koupi nového telefonu Samsung S20 FE, nelze aplikaci po instalaci otevřít Edit: Po updatu vše v pořádku | Je to dobrá apka a mají dobré dárky | Nelíbí se mi design souhlasu s marketingovými službami, je příliš jednoduché omylem přijmout vše a pak je složité najít, kde se souhlasy upravují, a tak většina se s tím nebude trápit. Připadá mi, jako kdyby to udělali schválně. | V aplikaci se mi nezobrazuje služba internetu, pouze telefonní číslo, takže nelze zaplatit všechny služby najednou. Přestože mám všechny smlouvy spojené s tímto telefonním číslem. | Zas vic jak mesic nefunguje 3D secure brana na dobijeni kreditu. Nebudu se vic vyjadrovat, ocividne tmobile nema zajem o poskytovani cisel a telefonich sluzeb, priste staci zrusit firmu a prestat blokovat lidem cisla misto toho aby jste se rozkladali v primem prenosu. | Tahle aplikace to je katastrofa. Asi nejhorsi co jsem videl, nacitani zabere tunu casu, furt jen cekam nez se neco nacte. Ale dle recenzi je tohle normalni. Co rict nemam vice slov... Zlaty vodafone! | dogshit app dogshit company | I paid late fees on 3 occasions because app was not displaying my bills properly and it occasionaly gets frozen or crushes | Bekkeje | Application is for Huawei p40 pro+ owners useless. This is for an IT company like T Mobile a bad reputation. | App is 50% translated and makes problem to understand it properly. If they make it fully translated it fould be 5/5 stars. | Being forced to update the app every time I try to use it, kinda sucks. Especially when its not on Wifi, trying to check the remaining data... | Superb | Great | Edit: Aplikace nyní funkční i na novém androidu (v.12). Aplikace funguje, ale nenabízí přehled služeb a placených cen což je škoda a konkurence nabízí - aplikace tak kromně placení ztrácí význam. Škoda nevyužitého potenciálu. | Apka se ani neotevře na top Android 12 chytrém mobilu. Přeinstalované 4 krát a nic. Vidím, že nejsem jediná s touto recenzí a poslední update byl v říjnu 2021...to snad ani není možné s tím nic nedělat pro takovou organizaci jako je T-Mobile. 👎👎👎 | Nejde spustit. | It crashes on Android 12 :( | Otravná aplikace, co posílá reklamní notifikace, o které se nikdo neprpsil, a pokud se zkusím přihlásit otravuje vzzdy se zadáním telefonního čísla, jako kdybych ho snad každých pár dní měnil. Děkuji předem za reakci ve smyslu ""my o problémů víme, my se jim zabýváme, my ho řešíme"" - n@sr@t | App is ok but need to option for English also | Na mém telefonu nefunguje - Nokia x20, Android 12. OS mi píše jen: 'The app keeps stopping.' | Bohuzial po nejakych updatoch sa mi uplne zrusili naviazane sluzby a opticky internet mi nejde uz ani pridat (uzivatelske meno neexistuje aj ked sa nim v pohode prihlasim na webe). Skusenost tristna a navrat par rokov spat ked neplatim vyuctovania v appke, ale rucne... velke sklamanie | The most horrible app experience. Laggy, full network , full wifi signal and it lags constantly. Constantly not working , completely or just parts of it. You wanted to make a payment , well to bad the payment component is momentarily out of order. Really horrible experience, also why T- mobile did you take out pay with Google pay?

That feature is just useless and this gives me a reason to put a three star review. | It was so good at the beginning. As my premium membership got completed, I noticed that the recommendation system in premium is worse than the normal account. The suggestions are always the most frequently listened songs but not according to the context I searched or related artist. With each day the user experience keeps getting worse . Please look into it and improve the use experience. | There are more ads than music that you listen to | Good | Useless interrupting advertisement only.. | Plss change tha app to normal. Can't even listen the song quitely without disturbing | Great | Way better than SoundCloud and apple music. Controls are really easy and navigating through the app is easy and straight forward. | This app seems like it can't handle a lot. Also, what is the point of paying to download music offline if, when I'm offline, I can't get the downloaded music to play? It's just a green wheel of doom 🙄 | Excellent | This app sucks now, before it was great until they made turning off shuffle a premium feature like I don't have premium and can't buy it, this sucks I don't really think they even deserve one star, if they changed it back then I'd probably give a 4 or 5 star, but for now no, plus the ads are annoying and imagine being so greedy for money that you make the feature to turn off the shuffle for money 💀, might as well make people pay 10$ for this whole app. | If you don't have internet the become useless | Utah beat Spotify it's the best | Use to be good, but after the last actualization, too many ads between podcast eps. I pay the premium, but the ads still appearing. | Such a complex and poor performing app | Great | Best for quality music streaming but always some scope for better. Still i will give u a 5. | Why tf do i need to play for premium to turn off shuffle thats stupid im uninstalling your app | w app | Best music on spotify | Rallye cool and really Nice | Worst | Love Spotify it's the only music app I'll ever online or off due to the download able music that I can listen to even when out of wifi or data | I pay for premium and i have to listen to ads during my podcasts. An absolute disgrace. I will be exploring alternatives. | Really amazing app in general,great for music,only problem is adds and certain restraints without premium but are all minor and aren't much of a problem,so a great app anyways | No problems. Easily find everything I've wanted. | It a amazing app | Currently the experience I have had with spotify has been horrible. Frequently it will say it can't connect to internet when I have data, so only wifi will work. When I Bluetooth to my car it reverts to any song I may have played more frequently in the past. And on top of that they changed some of the UI in the settings tab unnecessarily. Spotify fix your app because right now, it's garbage. Would not recommend buying premium until these features are fixed. | I love this app so much, I have Spotify premium and the benefits are great. All the features are great. But the app itself could use some work, certain glitches or errors in certain features effect the listeners experience in a negative way. For example, the jam feature, where 2 or more people can listen from different devices at the same time, it's a great feature. 🔥 | Bad | Some times it plays the song I want but most of the time it plays a random song | Good app | This app is definitely a life-saver for me. I'm a musician, always in touch with music and teaching sometimes, not only playing, and this app has always been my favorite way to show others basically why I am a musician. Literally Spotify is the only app I stomp my feet to always have the Premium signature on going, it's 100% worth it! Thank you so much to whom developed this 💚 | Ads are so irritation and song are messed up | برنامج حلو بس اعلاناته تفصل امها مايمدي اتأثر بالاغنيه يلي اسمعها الا يطلع لي اعلان ويعفس المود | Cant live without it | Worst music app you can ever find..it only occurs well when you buy subscription. | I use this app for 3 year this app is such a good and so nice | Spotify us my main music app but it seems since the recent update, I haven't been able to use Spotify on offline mode or without a connection. Even though I have already downloaded songs/playlists for offline listening, I still can't access them while offline | I'm sorry but there is just Way too many adds and when I say that I mean like an add after every each song which is ridiculous I hope y'all fix the frustrating issue. | It is like instagram algorithm. You will definitely get what your mood needs. Mahn it's good. 🤍 | The app is lagging too much, nd while playing i cant even forward the song..bec i dont listen to a few songs from their very beginning ..i always move them a little forward. also even after using premium..the problem remained the same. secondly there are just too many unnecessary reccomendations out there which are irritating! | 🙏🙏 | pretty please learn how to ""shuffle"" playlists 🫠 | Premium | super! | Only one thing your good at! | Goof | Awesome! | Spotify rules over all. Had it since 2009. Second to none. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because now that I'm building up massive playlists, there's no way to drag and reorder songs on mobile!!! Surely this isn't such a big function to add in a future patch? | Ad khatam kardo bhai 🌚 | Can't use for ringtone why should I download, I better use YouTube premium is better buy used this rubbish app | dontlike | To much ads | Wonderful there's nothing like good smooth jazz | I highly recommend Spotify to users because it's one of the best apps ever in the world and there's nothing bad about there's no bugs or anything like that but I can tell u one thing and that's download this app u won't regret it at all | Welcom | Man Spotify is helpful and piece full I like it and me and my family been enjoying it so good and finding our music is really helpful to thank u spotify very much | Finally switched to youtube music, i'll endure their no background play (if not premium) but still not coming back to this disgusting app. Even if I ever have to pay, 'll willingly pay for any other app but not for spotify. | It's very nice and good | Very disappointed | These music apps are getting ridiculous. Ive paid for years to have premium and you miss one payment of course it kicks u outa the package and sends u back to the basic version and gives u adds after EVERY DAMN SONG. No loyalty in these industries. | This app has become so greedy and annoying now. you get an awful user experience if you don't have premium, even basic things like skipping music is pay walled | I have paid for premium for yrs! Now I can't knock off shuffle and play straight. Fix this! | Amazing experience on Spotify till I started using this app, Ii am also gaana user so one thing i notice spotify just lagg because of lyrics is not show on display during streaming.... | Very bad | I like so much cause the music is so clear and you can even use it offline | Spotify :Music & Podcasts His app is very much and all the music are play in spotify Example - attitude song ,motivasion song ,love song ,sad song,lofi song ,or all the singer song it search in spotify. .. ... .... .....thanks for seen | I don't like how it changed | Good but now it gives samples of music from my playlist and I don't know what to do. | Bad | Ad bahut aate hai 🤬🤬 | Love it | Don't like the new updates it's annoying | Previous button, song forward not working. Solve the issues imedediatley. | Why people would download this app when it only wants money and money which is not a offense but why the hell this much? | Good | You can ligand to ddot notti dd Osama kayflock | There are various types of music and can find it easily the most i like is that when we leave the app the music still plays it can help me in my drawing and etc | Best app | Too worst.... So many ads | Most unreliable software in the marketplace | Speechless | Annoying. Anytime you go back to the app, it shows you the last screen you were on, like a playlist, or the home screen, allows you to interact with it for 1 second then immediately MAXIMIZES THE LAST SONG YOU PLAYED AND COVERS THE WHOLE SCREEN REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER YOU WERE JUST DOING. | Spotify, I admit you guys have the best things in the app. But lately I can't play a single music at all, and it says 'you discovered a premium feature!'. I don't have premium and I'm not using it. I don't understand why is that happening but I wish it can be fixed. | Bad after update | Only one song can be played on each day. Cannot listen to that same song twice a day. This stuff wasn't there lastly but now it has been there. Very annoying. And all of a sudden a new boring song plays in a queue. | Love this app! | I used this app since long time...I wanna really recommend you this app for your thinking at night time.... like if you listen slow and reverb songs at night 😀 | ✨👍💟💟💟💟💟💋 | Good | Ghatiya no 1 | Sigma | This app is just pay to listen 0 stars if I could im gonna download music from a free torrent. | B c d e f | What do you except from Spotify when you use free plan. Nothing but Bulk of add. Literally iam listening to advertisement more than ever it's like iam listening to music around 3-4minutes. if my total listening time is 12minutes | ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads!"" And then I get an ad after the next song .. | Good selection of music and in your genres, app plays great similar artists allowing you to ""discover"" new music. | Too many ads | After update this app provide bad service | Alone partner | Nice | Not willing to pay for premium to have just basic features that I can already have by logging into the app on a computer. | 👌 | Very bad app... They are not giving full control to users... Only premim members are allowed to control everything | muy buena | Make it free | I've music | Once a great app now a dumpster fire. What is this smart shuffle garbage and why as i paying subscriber for over 10 years can i not disable this? Bluetooth breaks if wifi drops (even tor downloaded songs). Every time i reopen the app i have to apply the your library filters. I never use any other than playlists, by you + sometimes downloaded. Yet every time i have to go through the same pointless extra taps. Spotify UX has absolutely collapsed this last year, what is going on with the desigers?! | Bit expensive but still the best | It's a good time experience I ever see but now it became worst and cheap ruled app so just use and throw this app | Music keeps pausing on its own, idk why. I'm using S23 Ultra in case you are wondering | Bring back landscape mode for in-car use. This is ridiculous | Love this app,just have 2 concerns.When I search up a song and try to play that exact song the song changes to a different song and doesn't play the song I want.Second,I made a playlist and I put the music I wanted on there and it started playing different songs that I never added on the playlist.But other than that this app is good. | jayantajayantakanda | It is the super app | Say playlist are empty each time I try to play one of mine but also the ouest proposed on the home screen... no way to have some music. Is there any solution to this issue ? | Brilliant app | Best experience musically | Experience has gotten terrible. Loading times and search functionality is slow. | All time app 2024 | Worst after update | this app is only good for premium members | spotify used to be a great app. but over time due to all the unnecessary updates it has become the worst version of itself. you can no longer manually play songs in a specific order, or even rewind etc well its obvious that youve made the changes as spotify used to give free service to the users and its probably not profitable but now it has also stopped displaying the lyrics which is a huge inconvenience. i request spotify to fix all the glitches and recover the app to how it was earlier. | GV GAMER 🥱👎 500mb | Nice app and the song verry cools | this app lets you listten to music and gives you the lirics! sadly, if you dont pay, you might listen to adds highly recommended | Do not download it , if we put premium we can enjoy but free is worst😡 | nice app | bad experience irritated by the ads | Hey,now it is the best app I'm using every day and night and it comes with many features like background plays and many more thanks to Spotify | 5/5 kodtha edde but jasthi ads matte sanna putta features gu premium kelutte ed bitre spotify is the best comparatively | Always get what I want in this app | It's was so good before but now it's becoming more and more worse because after the updates they didn't allowed us to play songa in order in playlist, we just have to use only shuffle mod, that was fine btw. But what about now we can play the same song again, why ??? | Too many adds plays same songs all the time | Nice | Worst ever | Open link to song not working | Error message is try again by mobile number login, Thanks. | Let me disable smart shuffle for good. I'm sick of it randomly turning on when I ask my car to play a Playlist. If I wanted to listen to music that wasn't on my Playlist I would turn on the radio. | it's a great app and all but I have a problem with the 30 minute listening thing. You're supposed to get 30 minutes of undisturbed music until a few ads pop up. At 9:07 PM an ad finished and music was playing, then at 9:15 PM an ad popped up. This happened multiple times before and I was wondering if you guys could fix this since the 30 minutes of undisturbed music was fake for me. Though, I don't know if it's just a bug but fix it please | This app was good until put ads and premium subscription for everything 😡 | Such a emotional app | Ad only 1 music 10ads | Functions very poorly when not connected to the internet. What is the point of downloading songs if I can't actually listen to them outside of wifi because ""no internet connection?"" Even simply navigating the app offline experiences bad lagging | Yoga | Don't like it | Poor | This is very nice app | I 💕 speed muzic of Spotify playlist","{""1"":1962994,""2"":689200,""3"":823781,""4"":2634090,""5"":24632388}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 89.00 - CZK 2,699.99 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Spotify AB","Spotify+AB","support@spotify.com","https://www.spotify.com","Spotify AB

Other than that, it's a phenomenal app and I would still recommend it to people."",""The app was perfect beforehand, but now I can't go to a certain song in one of my Playlists, can't fast forward, can't skip.

Clicking on any of my playlisted songs, something random is played. Ditto when you search for a song.

The card won't connect properly. It's never been a problem before until recently. It says the card is already added, but doesn't show where the card should be. I've contacted my bank, they've issued a new card but this hasn't changed or fixed the problem. Uninstalled/reinstalled many times, cleared cache etc+others ideas nothing helped. Now use physical card for contactless buys. G support have been helpful to an extent but even they don't know what's gone wrong! | I try Google wallet first time in walgreen didn't work I don't why it need better a update and more accurate and secure and rewarding for using it | All in all, simply brilliant & fabulous | All the loyalty cards just stopped working for no reason and tips in the developers' reply gave no clue | Just think enough. | New update has stopped all my card from working via Google pay. Will be uninstalling. | Add lock feature like Google pay has so if your phone is taken or someone knows your password they can't just get in your wallet. That's what I love about Google Pay | Won't work anymore and no idea why | Love my Google Wallet. | Why did you just took 5,99 euros out of my bank account? I didn't pay anything myself | Crashes on card open | Ím new tó | I got a model_10 | Don't work on my tablet or android phones | Twice now all my cards have disappeared Had to reinstall all of them again Once more and I will be deleting app | Very good | Love it | They change that ever payment even small need unlocking the phone, I'm going back to my debit card so I can pay easily for small amounts without pin or unlocking. Useless app now. | scammers trapped me I'm lose money throght google payments. Google blame me. Thank you scammers | Now started asking verification for every small payment, this should be an option the user can change. Verifying and trying again sometimes causes the cashier to have to restart the payment, causing annoyances and delay. My debit card works contactless without verification for small payments, so you have made the app much worse to use than the card itself. It worked well before why did you ruin it? | Cool | This app takes money frymy account if I'm next to a card machine please improve | I like this app very much and I recommend it but for some reason I am having trouble with the last update, it's not installing.... | Someone hacked playstore | Google pay was so reliable! What happened with the latest update? Since.changing the 'no need to unlock' it's been awful. Unable to tap on/off opal card readers in Sydney. Error: need to verify.with fingerprint. error, please try again can't read cars. 3rd time lucky. By this point the bus driver has attempted to close the doors thinking you don't want to get off. And a queue of people waiting behind trying to tap on/off. Please fix it! | Why doesn't it say on the app that it only works with specific phones?? I almost got the biggest disgrace of my life the other day | We use tap and go here in Australia. Can you make it so don't need to unlock phone if under $100 | Very good app | Chris Bartow is a hacker and Tommy even is a hacker | All is well here | excellent | No option for fingerprint confirmation before payment | Requires to unlock phone every time I wanna pay. My credit card still doesn't. | App seems to be very secure, but it doesn't give very many options to ID verify, I've been trying to do that for several weeks now. Please give me some insight on how to get it done, Las Vegas NV resident | Still no fix for an issue I have had for months. When I try to pay after unlocking my phone and tapping to pay, the NFC reader asks me to check my phone because for whatever reason Google Wallet asks me to verify my fingerprint and unlock my screen AGAIN even though I already unlocked my phone to pay. This requires to get an error the first tap to then pay on the second tap. Very dumb design | It let charges go through without asking first. But things I try and actually purchase it doesn't go through. | Recent changes require pin entry for every transaction... so you present your phone, it doesn't go through, so you take your phone back and enter your pin (now a 2 hand op) then present your phone again. In many cases the vendor has to reset their terminal. It's easier just to tap my credit card. I was low on storage anyway so deleting google wallet was an easy choice. Used to be good. Not worth having now. | Good app | Yes please | It won't load the tickets I bought. | Upgraded my Samsung a12 to Samsung s3 now it doesn't work I have tried everything nothing works | Easy. Super easy. Convenient. | Why are there only 4 different state options? | Need to be updated so it works with all phones. | It's been trying to force me to install this to use Google pay and through my account for in ap purchases which I do not care for. Also heard its not very secure and my bank would not ok the set up through them which tells me is very insecure. Do not use. | You must be kidding?! Fingerprinting every single tap to pay payment, even for couple of cents?! Have it in US if you are required but why bothering EU users? | Im very pleased | worked once and isn't working anymore. | I get an error message that says there's a problem setting the active account? Would you like to try again. 10 to 15 attempts and I still can't get into the wallet. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. They're way y'all can help me right here. It doesn't have anything to do with Enterprise software. I don't believe? I hope not! This is getting expensive | Hello Team! I had an issue and reported I was told it will be resolve very quickly but now it's more than 2 months and I am not getting the response from your side, several times I approach but nothing. Hope to hear from you back via this review. | 😍 | I want fingerprint verification to open this app, but I can't add my fingerprint | Used to be great but after the lastest update it suddenly requires fingerprint unlock right before every payment, even though my phone was already unlocked and the app was opened and ready. It's really annoying and defeats the purpose of sparing time if I have to go through this every time- putting the phone to the pos terminal, only to have it deny the transaction and lock itself, requiring me to unlock it again, sometimes my fingerprint not matching the first time...so frustrating!! | ok | am with S24ultra. It been stopped working for 2 weeks now. firstly can shop in store but not TFL London transport. but this week totally dead not working at all. have to use physical card again. contacted bank and TFL but found no issue or blocked webs from them. Is Google wallet problem. so inconvenience. fix it please. | Finding very hard to open | Hot | Needemails | 100 parsant okay | Just stopped working, my card won't open, it just spins for eternity, it was ok , tried everything, cleared cache reinstalled app and cards I'm using pixel 8, it was the same on my old 7 pro, very frustrating, thinking about switching to another app ? | Was working ok. Now it is saying it won't because my phone is not certified / recognised... It should be as it is a bonafide android 13 phone and everything is up to date.. and this Play store says it is certified!! | Looks nice and everything, too bad it doesn't work. | It has stopped working... uninstall/reinstall didn't work. Removing and re adding cards doesnt work. Edit in response: anytime I open the app and go to use a card from the wallet vis contactless payment, nothing happens | How do you stop this app from scanning without security first. It will scan without bringing the app up? Need better security | Awesome | Security is terrible. If someone were to steal my phone from my hand while I was using it, they could go on a spending spree. Put a seperate lock on the app! | Took £1 off me for paying my energy bill what has me paying a bill got to do with you? Refund it now, bill isnt pending so why have you taken my money? | Without me updating my phone or the app, this app no longer automatically works. It prompts for PIN or fingerprint for every single purchase, no matter how small. I tested it just now by paying for my items across 2 purchases, less than 60 seconds after I verified it asks me to be verified again. Usually this leads to errors as the second time fails often, and this is also extremely infuriating. This makes an app I've used for all payments for the last 2 years totally useless. | Cannot add my card with nothing after change my phone. It is fixed so 4 stars until next update | Hi ser god morning | once updated to latest version , all existing credit card data disappeared and need to be reenter | Nice I like it all | When Xiaomi released the new software update suddenly Google pay stopped working and it doesn't allow me to add my cards. Everything works properly except the GPay | There is a problem with setting up my active account. Wallet was working well only days ago. No I cannot access it! | I am blocked to pay with my phone. It randomly works. I have no clue why that happens. In some shops I have no problems and it works fine, in some others I get warning... | so ez cuhhhh | Excellentayyyyy | This app make my phone lack until I play games also can't smooth | Does this mean my funs over. As much as I hate to admit it I do need more socal interaction for immediate issues. So what's this mean. Thank you I'm not even sure If I get it yet. | Tap. Sometimes need to unlock phone. Done. Feature request: I wish there was a way to require unlock for all purchases. Great app regardless. | I have to unlock the app AFTER I have tapped the reader. This is very inconvenient when the reader is positioned low. I don't mind unlocking every time I use the app, it's just difficult to unlock it IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSACTION. | As long as international bill payment is not supported from Ethiopia, I couldn't afford to purchase any product of my need online shopping. That's why I'm going to rate 3 for Google wallet, since I'm not satisfied with. | Password every time I use it, | Fire | Was working great, but now keeps asking for my passwords and pin numbers when I am trying to pay, even when I have unlocked my phone saying it needs to verify my Id? Has become very inconvenient to use. | I enjoy using this application so much that I even downloaded it on my son's phone to add his money card. I want him to be able to purchase things on his own when he goes on trips without me. However, Google Wallet is saying he's too young, despite me giving full permission. Can you please help change this? | Lovely | good | $safe | Scary how well it works. | Phone forces this app on my phone. Never wanted but forced to waste data to download | Stopped working 3 days in | Good | Stopped working. Was working fine up until 3 days ago. Now it wants my finger print. So I do that and it won't work at all. Close app and reopen, I hold it to the reader and it shows the check mark but the machine declines it. My bank card still works fine. App doesn't. Annoying. Ininstalling. | All good | I'm honestly getting really tired of the constant swapping between wallet, pay, pay send, etc., but especially when they discontinue one app while leaving a half baked option as your only choice. I cannot manage my cards because it asks to verify the phone I am using as a passkey, can't verify it, ask for my password which I enter correctly and it accepts it, but it still then wants my phone as a passkey. Awful. | GREAT | I have to get this right! | Bigo | Constantly having to clear data then reinstall as it tells me my software isn't up to date (though it is). It then works for half a dozen transactions before the same message pops up. Have learnt not to leave my actual wallet at home after a couple of extremely annoying supermarket trips! | it's solid | b Dr gu imi ca, | This app is spot on and works absolutely flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy SM- A528B and never failed since I installed it. The negative star reviews on here I can't understand it's probably down to your phone set up or you simply don't know what you're doing setting Google wallet up in the first place. Keep up the good work Google. | Didn't do what I need | Every time i try to open this app it dont open n crash. So uninstalled it n using other app now. | Great for standard cards, hopefully more support for custom merchant cards and memberships, for both wireless and non-wireless purposes. | It requires pin code for every purchase even the phone is unlocked already. | Today on each purchase wallet asking for pin code, its annoying! I tried to remove Bankf Of Georgia master card from wallet it says ""mastercard *** successfully removed"" But card is still in wallet, i tried to clear cash also remove all data but card still exists in app. What the heck? | Like cash app | Absolute garbage recently. I have to restart my phone when I'm trying to pay for travel in the underground, Tesco... It really is annoying standing like sausage at the station gates What the hell happened??! | I was confused, didn't know what press. Please make it easy for me. | It's showing payment suspended after I enter my card details. | good | Something happened with the lock functionality. Now, when it attempts the user to unlock for a payment, it keeps asking for unlock and when you unlock it, it doesn't make the payment. This scenario stays in a loop when unlocking is necessary. (Seems that it's not for every payment machine. Just happened in a PagBank machine, for example) | Luv it it made my life easy as it should be thanks | Very informing!!!. | It's a awsome app to use and it really helps keep my account organized love it | Love it | It's so easy to use | Absolutely useless | UPDATE: ISSUE STILL NOT FIXED!!! DON'T ""FIX"" SOMETHING IF IT'S NOT BROKEN!!!! New update has a fancier animation to switch cards BUT CARDS DON'T LOAD WHEN YOU LAUNCH APP SO YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN GOOGLE ACCOUNTS THEN THEY SHOW UP WITH MUCH LAG! What a waste of time! | you ve avoided my question, why after 9/10 days it literally keeps asking for me to verify , the app pointless waste of space | Google pay work. This app not secure.It let's anyone that can get in phone access. Doesn't show transactions when purchases are made. | Make phone number | I got scammed | Can't be locked or secured separately from phone lock | I've been using it for a very long time and I am satisfied with the people who are able to work with you and your very good friends and I am interested in the same way I have received it for a few years I haven't been or really had any problems with it or anything else and thank you all once again. | Really convenient app for event/entertainment tickets and also payment methods. The only issue I've found is that some event tickets are not archived after the event has happened, and there's no option to archive them. | Great app | Great service | All my cards have suddenly disappeared without any notification/information. And no, I haven't changed any security settings or done any actions explaining that. This is very annoying as the app is useless without cards and I now leave my physical cards home.... | Now Wallet can handle pkpass files. This is what makes Google cool. As much as Apple hype Integration I believe the Google ecosystem is much better. This is why this app gets 5 stars. | Love this app thanks Google for making it sexy give me a lady with a wallet. | Are you Google weather for all of my credit card and gift cards add event my cash app cards Google wallet is used all around the world Google wallet is so convenient to have do you have with you you can buy everything with your Google wallet Eden shop at Google Play store so if you don't have Google wallet all right Google Pay download it right now both and by the way on 20-year-old Google Gmail account member in my name is Producer Terry Lawrence Johnson 🏧💲🪪🖋️💳💵✍️ download Google Pay 💳 | I love 💘😘 | Need to be easier to get your own personal card number and design From what r your interest (General) | It's good | Been fun but next time I want Earplug,Blinders, and Lips so dont slip 😂. | What a rollercoaster! After working perfectly for years, it stopped. I'm now presuming it was due to an old phone at end of software support. Last week I upgraded to Pixel 8 Pro, and it's magically back to normal again - as it should be. All bank and loyalty cards are present and working. This is an app that you never really think about until it's not working as intended. Apparently I've now got 7 years up my sleeve before I have to work about it again! 😅 | ""Verify it's you"", even though the device was already unlocked with my fingerprint. That's what we get from lazy and incompetent postmodern codemonkeys. | 21.03.24 this app is still not working. Fix it! I've done as you said. It's not working since the upgrade in Feb 2024. I have to carry my cards with me at all times, not happy! Fix it ASAP!!! I'm not sure how to reply. It is the Google Wallet when trying to pay for a purchase using an EFT machine. It just doesn't work since update. My rewards cards work though. Location is Australia Replying again.. I will try as per your suggestion via email..I'll be in contact again if it fails. | Not compatible | Fantastic | You can turn NFC on in the wallet but can't turn it off? | My Huawei cellphone updated to Harmoney OS4 and you say my phone doesnt meet the security standard.

So whoever gets terribly bothered by a dog barking at them while listening to music can download the app and leave a one star rating 👍🙄 | Proč mi poslední dobou chodí ten samý mail dvakrát? A proč když vymažu jeden (protože nechci mít duplikáty), vymažou se oba? Mám nejnovější verzi. Děje se to tak cca 3 měsíce. Díky. | This app is weird. Got installed on my device without knowing it. Beware | Nemůžu si vytvořit účet | Stejný problém jako na apce email.cz. Používal jsem rozepsany email pro rychlý přesun souborů mezi PC a mobilem. Bohužel teď v rozepsanych emailech chybí možnost soubor stáhnout. Jedina možnost je soubor odebrat. | Aplikace pada vic nez euro momentalne | Gut | Seznam mám rád, tuhle apku moc ne. Mám ji aktuálně jako záložního klienta na email plus zároveň pro ověření přihlášení, avšak jako emailový klient pokulhává. Otevírání trvá dlouho, člověk se musí k mailu proklikat, občas skončí s několika okny mailu, když z nějakého mailu omylem zůstane otevřená v jednom z oken webovka, která odkazuje na nějakou apku (aka G. Photos), tak to při následujících spouštění této apky spouští tu jinou a ne např v ten moment chtěný email. Taky občas padá. | Serious issues with loading, when you're scrolling around the news feed it freezes and loads inconsistently. | This app is a mess. When I enter correct password it redirects me back to login. I'm so frustrated! Two factor verification also doesn't work. I can't get into my mail. Perfect. | After the last update, the app is much more user-friendly than before. Good job. | zbytečná aplikace co mi doslova jen zabírá cenné místo v úložišti jen abych měl 2fa... např epic games to mají vyřešené inteligentně... | I logged out, but when I open app. my email is still open..... so i deleted it | Ano, problem byl vyresen, chystal jsem se k oprave recenze, dekuji za vyrizeni, vse nyni funguje jak ma. | Quite good. Sometimes a bit slow. Keeps asking me to log in often, which is a bit bothering. | Nikdy sem nemela problemy, ale.poslednich par dnu me to nechce nacist emaily a ani do nich nahlednout. Samsung s9 | Mail inbox doesn't work properly, it's logging me out so when I click Inbox it logs me again. When I open inbox open in half so I can't read e-mails, so I need to close and reopen again. Terrible experience and I HAVE to use it because of the 2FA , PLEASE FIX YOUR APP. Redmi Note 9 | Easy to use | It's very informative | Nejde mi posouvat obrazovka . už je to opraveno | For it's purposes it's great | Nesmysl vše dvoufazove zabezpečeno a stejne jsem nakonec o email přišel hesla slozity jsou úplně k prdu | Kozy | Best browsing quality | Good apps | Bohužel nepodporuje tel. Číslo ze zahraničí. takže za 0 gdyby šlo v téhle době neuvěřitelné | Aplikace je pomalá a seká. Navíc nechápu, proč potřebuji mít dvoufázové ověření na emailu od Seznam a nemůžu použít dvoufázové ověření od google. Seznam se za posledních pár let prostě zhoršil. | Funguje dobře, ale ve srovnáním s chromem je pomalejší | Aplikace by byla docela v dobra kdyby nebyla pomalá, pořád nepadala a dokázala mě připojit na můj email bez toho aby se celá zasekla a nakonec mě stejně nepřipojila na email který si vyberu Dobrý nápad, špatné provedení ale s pár updaty by se to dalo jednoduše upravit. | very good . | Prosím přidejte možnost 2FA s TOTP aplikací | ok | The app is slow and crashes all the time. I cannot comprehend why would you ever use this over Firefox etc. But you have to have it as it's the only way to get 2FA for your email. What's wrong with TOTP or WebAuth? I regret ever signing up for seznam email. | Needed seznam 2FA but got this app full of other unneeded, annoying services. Bloatware? Removed. Pls add other OTP Auth apps too for Seznam accounts MFA. | Keeps freezing | Snad nejpomalejsi prohlizec co znam. Pouzivam jen na overeni pro logovani do sluzeb seznamu. Jinak skoro nepouzitelne i na rychlych telefonech. Jen zbytecne zabira v telefonu misto. | Pomali of | Dal bych méně, ale nejde to. | Great | Very bad performance even on latest phone. Clicking on mail icon on the left doesn't work sometimes. | I need simple 2FA not another browser. Please add support for TOTP authenticator apps. | Very bad taste. Who is your targeted audience? How do I block this poore taste vomit (extra) and get real content instead? | I'm pleased with it | Nice | Like | Not working. Not able to perform 2-factor auth, because this app wont even start. Well Done. Galaxy S10 with Android 11 Edit: Performed Phone restart, app reinstall and it seems OK. | Best seznam my Thinking any time what u want you finding 100 % you finding with Seznam liked | Nemohu hodnotit hlasového asistenta betaverzi (ale nějakou hvězdičku musím zatrhnout)? Hlasový asistent (povel) na mobilu 1+ 5T (android 10) se nepustí. Pejsek se mi na obrazovce obvykle ukáže ale nevím jak ho vyvolat když se někdy neukáže? Měl by hlasový asistent na tomto mobilu fungovat? Po çca 2 měs. stále žádná odpověď 😮 snižuji tedy rating 👎 Žel nemohu říci, nejde mi teď už ani pustit. Chybové hlášení odesláno. | Doesn't accept foreign numbers - absolutely useless if I can't verify through my British phone number. What a joke, threat to my security as I cannot active double authorization. | not google | Mobilni verze obcas nenabidne preklad. | Very good app | App icons are of unforgivably terrible quality | Quite nice, but the widgets don't work on my device (galaxy s9, ms launcher). They only show ""loading"". | Excellent | Limited capacity | Web view | Funguje dobre. Porad se zlepsuje. Aleš se stará. | Stale zamrza🙄 | Seznam jsem stahla pouze k aktivaci dvoufazoveho overeni na email.cz . Bohuzel mi nedovoli natukat britske cislo jako zachranne, a bez cisla se to aktivovat neda. Tak je mi to k nicemu. | Full with information | Good | It's good | super maps | GOOD | Katastrofalni aplikace. Cim dele ji mam v telefonu, tim je horsi a horsi. Nacte se az tak na desaty pokus, zamrza. Urcena vyhradne pro masochisty! 👎 | In current version full screen mode disapeared from menu. How can I activate it? | Very good so far | Super aplikace, děkuji | Great app! | 🤮 | Worry good | Italský slovnik - nedostatek slovicek | Been using this application for several years now. Efficient, love it. Thank you | Terrible app, keeps crashing all the time, doesn't notify of emails. | Obcas app nenajede a musim ho vyndat s znova prihlasit. | Hrozné. Jakmile se mobil odpojí od internetu a vy se pokusíte spustit aplikaci, tak spadne a poté padá pořád. A to nemluvím o neustálých internal errors při dvoufázovém ověření. | Fast and good | The best app on googleapp | Simple and intuitive. | Better than google. WAY BETTER!!!!!! | The best application ever. | 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 | Good | Perfect v Texasu. | dekuje | Like it | Great way to check on Czech news and have an email on the phone. Works without problems! | Bohužel dvoufázové ověřování nefunguje, v nastavení e-mailu je jedno zařízení přesto ověřování se ne ukáže, pak musím řešit vždy přihlašování skrz sms, taky po poslední aktualizaci zmizelo ""na později"", není v Službách (pod Mapy je Mobilni aplikace) můžu jenom přidat článek - stejně pak nepřečtu :-( , odinstalováno | first time user | easy and practical! | In the English version of the website it suggests downloading the app. I downloaded it. It's only in czech and you need a seznam account to sign in. Uninstalled. | Snazim sa stiahnut si tu appku, ale pise mi ze ju mam nainstalovanu. Pravda je taka ze som ju mal nainstalovanu kvoli inemu uctu asi tiez kvoli 2FA, ale odinstaloval som ju a teraz ju tam nemam. Nepouzivam mobil na citanie mailov. V com je prosim problem ? Dakujem. | Děkuji, ale nemůžu použivat překlad slova klepnutim a celou stranky v seznam zspravy - u navstaveny tato zapnouto, ale vubec nefunguje. Pomoc mí prosím Vás, moc potřebuju. Snažil se v Miui 10 a Oxygen Os na Android Pie. Děkuji moc. Moc se omluvam, aplikace překlada, ale z cizeho jazuku na česky. Má možnost překladat z češtiny do ruštiny? Učim se česky a to bylo moc dobře. Chci čist seznam zspravy a učit se česky. Moc děkuji! | I'd give it 5 stars if it's available in English | Aplikace absolutne debilni. Dvoufaktorova autentizace vetsinu pokusu vubec nefunguje, backup esemeska jde poslat az za nejakej cas, navic kvuli 2FA musim mit nainstalovanej nejakej pochybnej Seznam browser webu, coz je akorat prebrandovanej Chrome, akorat mnohem horsi. | Perfect.. Best Czech search engine. | Super | Helpful application. | funguje | It's good | Naprosto zbytečná aplikace, jenom browser s brandingem Seznamu. | App is just perfectly fine not much to criticize about this .) | Seznam byl driv dobrej vyhledavac, ale od ty doby co dela politiku a media je pouze dalsi blitka pro lidi co maj cas se hrabat v bordelu,teda pravde sorry za me total fail | Při pokusu o odeslání zprávy se rozepsané zprávy: 1) neodešlou 2) ani neuloží, přestože zvolím ""Uložit""  ...prostě zmizí. Takže můžu psát znova.  Ne vždy, ale rozhodně to není poprvé. | Aplikace neni spatna, ale posledni dobou neustale pada. | Dobrá apka co používám každý den, jen mi ode dneška začala vyskakovat hláška zda chci stáhnout  nějaký . swf s podivným (vždy jiným) jménem stylu 6Ejfjski853 atd ... Je to pro každém otevření. Mohli byste mi prosím poradit co to je? Dík | Bad | slow and unfriendly but it works. Latest versions are integrated with all functions of seznam and it is too much. it worked better when it was a simple email client. | Ještě se mi nepodařilo, aby aplikace načetla přílohu k odesílanému emailu. Když se ani na posedmé nenačte fotka, kterou potřebuji odeslat, bez ohledu na to, jestli ji zmenším, nebo ne, mám chuť, trísknout s telefonem o zem. Nepodařilo se mi ani přijít na to, jak označit všechny položky ve složce. Vyprázdnit spam, nebo obchodní sdělení  je tak hotové peklo. Označovat jednu položku po druhé je holý nesmysl. Najít způsob, jak napsat nový email mi také zabralo pár chvil. Celkově mi přijde aplikace neintuitivní a nedotažená. | Není to ono ... | Celkom dobrý prehliadač ale nie je taký rýchly ako napríklad Chrome. | Chtěl bych se zeptat, jestli máte v plánu udělat váš slovník jako aplikaci, protože tento slovník hodnotím lépe než jakýkoliv slovník díky počtu nabízených frází a příkladů vět, kde by se dané slovíčko mohlo vyskytovat.

Expected another necessary evil/bloat - got an actual working app | Easy to use | I can see only one of the three prepaid cards that I use, and there's no way to add the other two. Useless adware. | Za mě Super možnosti nabytí oproti konkurenci | Absolutely abysmal adware. Usefull for controlling your o2 services, but constantly spams advertising notifications without an option to opt out. I am already paying you so stop >:( | Aplikace je velmi jednoduchá na pochopení. vše je přehledné a srozumitelné. A o2 VÁM DÁ TŘI DNY 5G DAT ÚPLNĚ ZADARMO! Doporučuji všem co mají simku u o2. | some network eshuu | Asi to není chyba aplikace, ale spousta věcí tu nejde nastavit, ovládat atd Můžete si tu sjednat službu, zrušit už ne. Přístup O2 je na odchod, jenže není moc kam... | Vše přehledně dostupné. | Nejlepší operátor v ČR! | Good | Hrozný | 😍😍😍 | Na vyšší balík viem prejsť v aplikácii, ale na prechod do nižšieho musím volať na podporu, čo sa nezaobíde bez toho, aby sa mi nesnažili natlačiť ďalšie služby. Neetické obchodné praktiky sú dôvod prečo si aplikácia nezaslúži viac ako jednu hviezdičku. | Add notifications about unpaid bills, thx | Tak a znovu... Mám 100gb simku - horší připojení snad už nemůže být a pořád co 10-15 minut výpadek připojení. | Forcing updates. | Nemůžu se podívat kolik mi zbývá dat, protože mě aplikace nutí udělat update na Google Play, čímž si vyplýtvám další data. Chytré. Edit: Tomu rozumím, ale nemůžete je nutit aktualizovat a plýtvat jim tak placená data. Navíc žádná z přidaných funkcí není tak klíčová, aby bez ní aplikace nešla použít. Pokud ano, bylo by dobré to dát v aplikaci vědět. Takhle je uživatel (já) akorát naštvaný, že ho nutíte do něčeho, co v tu chvíli nepotřebuje a nechce. | Iks de | Dobrá aplikace. | Very nice. | Po aktualizaci se ukázalo, že budu muset na prodejnu, v ostatních ohledech je aplikace v pořádku, až to vyřídím a pokud bude vše fungovat tak klidně 5 hvězd | It is okay | Medky zlodějský | Ok | Nová aplikace je mnohem lepší než ta stará. | Svojí nespokojenost s touto aplikací musím vyjádřit znovu (minule kvůli hloupému systému správy mobilního internetu), ježto mi chodí SMS zprávy s informací, že mám na jeden den neomezená 5G data a mám si je tam vyzvednout. Nejen že moje propojené mobilní číslo ukazuje starý tarif, který už dávno nemá, ať jsem se díval kam jsem chtěl, data zdarma jsem nenašel. Škoda že nejde dát 0*/5, protože přesně to bych aplikaci udělil. Koneckonců mi ani neřekne, kolik dat mi zbývá nebo kdy se obnoví. | Apka je dobra, jen se mi nelibi, ze je nutna pro vyuziti vsech sluzeb, jenz platite. Nerad si zahlcuji mobil prehrselem zbytecnych aplikaci. | Chce hodnotit sotva sem to zap... | O2 is a scam, avoid them. They will confuse you to take most money they can. | Veľmi šikovná apka. | May tarrif 100 GB is not active and so very bad to me because I buy this SIM card but cannot use | Good | Pls, make full translation to English | V aplikaci se nejde zorientovat. | Superb services | Trapný... Tohle je taková levná aplikace. UX naprosto k h*vnu. | Nejdou vypnout upozornění na reklamní sdělení... | Black patterns to force people to accept tracking for marketting and not just the necessary. When connecting through my brother's phone using WiFi, this app logs me into his account instead of my SIM!!! I cannot even login into my SIM at all. After logout and login again, I am straight into his SIM account. | It's such a good application, to be honest until now all the functions and services are great. | Good application. | Nice app but there still place to improve interface | Good network for foreigners.. English speaking customer service available | It's very nice and practice application 😊 | Nice | Ok | I have never seen anything worst than o2 service, I don't recommend it | App has problems with ID scanning, paid SIM service didn't work when I payed for it, and all because of their technical problems. | Im sutisfied but sometimes the signal is weak.. | 10/2022. Nová verze a je to tu zase :-(. Nechápu, proč téměř po každé aktualizaci žádá aplikace o opětovné přihlášení. Nastaveno mám přihlašování přes otisk prstu a heslo si neznam z paměti. Proto, když jsem na místě, kde nemám možnost vytáhnout heslo z keepassu, nemohu se do aplikace přihlásit. Jinak s aplikací nemám problém, ale popsaná ""vlastnost"" ji znehodnocuje. U jiných aplikací podobného druhu jsem to nezaznamenal. Nedovedu si představit takto nefunkční app třeba u smartbankingu. | Good | One of the most expensive mobile operators in EU, probably around the world. At the same time the quality and network coverage is poor. You will lost the network even in the urban areas. If you have prepaid card they will steal amount of the unused mobile data in one month. This is a kind of robbery, in case you paid for it. It is the same if you buy a bottle of water, but the shop would take it from you, if you not drinking.. Avoid. Scam | Mohlo by být více muziky | Když aplikaci nejvíc potřebuju, tak to napíše "" máme pro vás nové funkce"" a nepustí mě to do ní bez toho, aniž bych ji updatoval. Po updatu se musím znovu přihlásit, protože mně to opět odhlásilo. Tyhle vynucené updaty aplikaci znehodnocují. Kromě toho aplikaci musím mít naklonovanou, takže ji mám v telefonu dvakrát, protože stále neumí víc, jak jeden účet. Kromě toho mě aplikace po nějaké době sama odhlásí a musím se znovu přihlašovat. V tomhle stavu je to pro mě už prostě bohužel nepoužitelné. | To use this app, need to scan id. Which is annoying. But still tried, and it cant scan my id!! Tried a lot of time, but its not working. Only, because the app is bad, I had to change operator. Idk, should I call it the worst service? I ever faced? Actually, I didn’t received any service at all. Maybe O2 is the worst sim company on the planet earth. Who knows, if the aliens have worse service then maybe 02 will get some competition on being the top garbage. Thank you. | Asking every time about data collection until you accept everything. This is a very, very bad practice! | Makes easier to pay and chrch up services | Dobre | Cool | Good | Pravidelně crashuje, prakticky každý měsíc přeinstalovávám, abych mohla vůbec zaplatit vyúčtování. A když potřebuju udělat nějaké změny, tak to v 9 z 10 případů vyhodí nějakou technickou chybu. Používám se zatnutýma zubama jen proto, že nemám nervy na to, chodit na pobočky osobně (ostatně, proč bych v tomhle století vůbec měla!). | I like it | Dělá to co má dělat. | Im can't canel automatic credit recharging. I'm try deactive this function, bu only what im see it's ""Your reqest has been send to the process"". And nothing change. I waited half an hour and tried many times already. Autorecharge is still work and the feature is active. | Wow, super | Keeps crashing!! Shaking doesnt help. Report pop up is blocked by other report pop up. It just stops, won't let me do anything else | Extremna zla aplikace. Ve vyhodach se vubec neda hledat, to uz je prosim rovnou muzete zrusit, kdyz je delate takhle neprehledne. To, ze se pod stejnym emailem nemuzu prihlasit z PC (pry ""neexistuje"") i kdyz jsem naprosto v poradku prihlasen pres mobil je jen prijemny bonus navic. | Practical and well executed without unnecessary distractions. | Good app, but I'd suggest to remove it's availability only for Czech Republic. It would be easier for refugees to use the app. | tragic, registration proces not completed | Bothering application | přehledná | Nastavení jsou většinou jen odkazy na web Moje O2. Nenašel jsem nikde možnost či návod, jak bych pod svůj stávající účet mohl přidat předplacenou GO kartu. Aplikace je podle hlášky při přihlášení nezabezpečená. | 02 doing everything to let down the customer | neprehledny | I don't want to add this to my google pay... Its my freedom and o2 have no rights. They took the one time login and forcing people to add this one for their sake. | Wonderful app | Unable to pay, app is crashing | O2 Treats doesn't work | I typed in my phone number to get sms code. Never received one. | the worst network and application of all time, normal web and app login doesn't work, lots of money and bad internet | Perfect app | It is even less than 1 star. App dosen't even start. Worked fine for a konth or two and after that it is just crashing. | No issues so far, does what I need it to. | Thank you for stealing money. Evidenice in sms. I have o2 go with activated month tariff. I top up credit. First you charge 20 czk for daily Internet usage and then instantly charge 180 czk for a monthly Internet. All evidence in sms. You just stole 20 czk when one tariff was activated on top of the other | Good app | I really appreciate G Pay feature on your app. Saved 10 years lifetime, compared to stressing alternative. BIGTNX4U | Aplikace nefunguje, pada pri kazdem zapnuti. Nespolehlivy operator. Proc? | Good Apps | Doesn't work | Crashing upon opening so I cannot top up my card | Good | Dělá co je potřeba velice dobře | ok | Nemohu se vubec prihlasit. Takze, ted uz ani nikdy nedobehne update. | Why does it force me to download updates so often? I have two bank apps and they are never so aggressive. Awfull and why do you keep doing it? Often updates and minor new features.. Estimated times of maintainnace are not real. Sometimes would not work for days. Invoices inside app doesn't have qr code while the ones arriving to mail does. Ads on top of the app that can't be removed. I am paying you money and still see ads?? Respect your customer. | Přestože je zapnuté ověření otiskem prstu, po čase vyžaduje nové přihlášení jménem a heslem. Nenašel jsem, jak to vypnout. | Google Pay does not work | Super app and card. | Líbí se mi. S touto aplikací mám slevy a vše je přehledné. | Takže na formuláři pro one-time login je povinná předvolba, ale je zakázané napsat + na klávesnici. Naštěstí je tam předvolba předvyplněná, ale tu často přepíše autosugesce na klávesnici a pak uživatel netušíco je blbě. Fixněte to pls. A chybí widget. Z jiného důvodu lidi tuto aplikaci nechtějí. | Terrible, terrible app. Always rejects my login, email, phone number, everything. | Awesome | Simply amazing ☺️ | OK | Super | Easy to use | Excellent | Konečně to funguje | Good but sluggish | Good | Works very well never had any issues | Přestal fungovat přístup přes ověření otisků palců (teď se musím prohlašovat s mailem a heslem) + nefungují odkazy z notifikací (různé promo akce, nabídky a soutěže). Po kliknutí na notifikaci se v aplikaci nic neotevře. Mám pocit, že s každou aktualizací této aplikace se její úroveň jen snižuje. Škoda... | Finally in English with relevant prepaid card information | tidy app | Not bad. | Usefull! | Marketing aplikace. Sice vidim, jestli mam zaplaceno, ale jinak: posila reklamy Neobsahuje volbu jak reklamy odhlasit Pokud v chatu chci odhlasit reklamy, rekne at napisu jindy Nemuzu pridat predplacenou SIM kartu Neustale se pta jestli se mi libi, ano prejde na hvezdicky, pokud ne, zazene me do formularu a vyplnovani emailu. Pokud chcete dalsi reklamy, krome tech po sms, tohle musite nainstalovat. | Nepouzitelna aplikace. Proc se jmenuje Moje O2 a ne Moje O2 SIM? Nenasel jsem zpusob jak pridat dalsi dve karty, ktere mam. | Pretty, fast and clean UI, all the necessary info is visible right on the home screen. -1 star because I haven't been able to pay via card online multiple times. GooglePay worked though. (Pixel 4a 5g) | Moje O2. Ahoj | I am confused. Are we paying you money to provide mobile service or for your ads? You have ads in the app you are sending ads via sms. You force to update app more than a bank app and on my second home i am often loosing signal. How many stars you would give yourself? | Works well, intuitive, no issues. | All is good!!! | Nice | Přehledná aplikace, jednoduchý a čistý design :) | Useless | Neustale ukazuje, že se některé informace nepodařilo načíst. Tím se stává aplikace zcela zbytečnou | Tato aplikace je fakt super | Useful application :) | Missing one star because some setting can only be done at web | V pohodě funguje | Nejhorsi aplikace z trojky operatoru u nas. Neumi automaticky zalogovat v pripade, ze je uzivatel na siti O2. Mezi aktualizacemi se smazou ulozene prihlasovaci udaje. A uplne nejvic me stve, ze na firemnim cisle neni mozne videt spotrebovana data v danem mesici, pokud uzivatel neni zaroven spravce. Secto a podtrzeno, adept na nejneuzitecnejsi aplikaci roku. | Dobri | Docela v pohodě | Whats use of app when you cant even sign in to the account, reset account pwd, activate packages and tariffs for weeks already. | Excellent | Proč po mně aplikace neustále ohlašuje a vyžaduje stále dokola přihlášení mailem a heslem, když jsem zadala, že se chci prihlasovat otiskem prstu? Prosím o opravu. | I can't use the app at all. The login fails for an error in the system | An excellent app. | Very bad experience ever with a mobile network, I paid the money I owe to a o2 shop but they later told me by text message that the payment is not reflecting in the office computer, so now it's my fault that you don't have competent o2 shop assistants?They blocked my Internet, bared my calls,.. bad experience ever. | Už funguje i pro firmy. Hezký design. | Docela fajn. Jde ručně přepnout jazyk appky do češtiny když ji mám v angličtině? | The download speed of the application is not the same on WiFi as on Data. The SMS code as a confirmation when logging in is unnecessarily complicated. Not all phones can automatically retrieve the code from the SMS. It's outdated technology btw. If you were to follow (for example) the online banking apps of banks that you already have in the Czech Republic, I think you could save the product. | What's happening with app? I can't use it during two weeks((( | Funguje skvěle. Jednoduchý a přehledný. Palec nahoru za tmavý režim :) | Finally, it is lightning fast. I also like fresh graphic design. App is well structured, billing especially :-). | Super good. Working just fine. Thanks for the update. | Unable to sign in using email. Get answer ""unexpected reply"". | Oproti T-Mobile je celé uživatelské rozhraní O2 pohroma. | Jakmile to zapnu, tak to vždy po 5 vteřinách spadne, takže prosím o aktualizaci Odinstaloval jsem to několikrát a pořád nic, furt mi to padá a žádnou chybu to nepíše. | Nejde zapnout ctecka otisku prstu.. vzdy se sama vypne? .. Diky za odpoved .. uz jsem to zprovoznil .. musi se zapnout trvale prihlaseni a pak uz to jde pres otisk pokazde. Vse OK. Diky | v 90 % se nenačtou informace a když ano, tak to strašně trvá | Hard to figure out how to fill in the 30cm platform 20cm patent leather size 37 allowed platform pleaser allowed blue and and always will be very hot wow wow wow wow wow really wow beautiful lady in heels very hot wow wow wow wow wow. | Aplikace tvrdí že je vše zaplaceno, ale po rozkliknuti se ukáže faktura k zaplacení. Naprosto strašný design. | That worked just to sk and im in de so i cant top up my card | Úplně k ničemu, proti Můj Vodafone nezobrazí vůbec nic. Naprosto zbytečná aplikace, jen odkáže do samoobsluhy v prohlížeči. Odinstalováno | Not in english | Usually can't log in with prepaid card. Sometimes it works via SMS code, but usually it crashes. Useless app. | Aplikace neakceptuje přihlašovací jméno (email) obsahující znak plus (+). GMail znak plus v emailu podporuje a webový login do moje.o2family.cz také. Zapnutí přihlašování pomocí otisku prstu nefunguje. EDIT: Pokud nezapnu trvalé přihlášení, zapnutí přihlašování pomocí otisku se samo vypne (zapnu, odejdu z nastavení, kouknu zase do nastavení – vidím vypnuto). Změním‑li si na webu přihlašovací email na variantu s plus, do aplikace se NEpřihlásím; nastavení téže adresy bez plus funguje. | Přišla neočekávaná odpověď ze serveru .... | Nefunguje přihlášení. | No popravde je to celkom tragédia, akákoľvek požiadavka v app (zistenie zostavajuceho množstva dát, prehľad faktúr atp) trvá neakceptovateľne dlho a z 90% dostanem hlášku, že došlo k neočakávanej odpovedi zo serveru a celé to spadne... Za mňa to patrí medzi najhoršie appky od operátora za celý čas... Prosím ak na to chcete reagovať z O2 tak žiadny ďalší email Vám k tomu písať nebudem... Nemám k tomu co viac dodať... | Stupid app | Příšerný, už nějak po 3. tenhle týden tato aplikace nefunguje, protože jí údajně ""vylepšujou"", což určitě ani ve finále nepůjde poznat. Navíc pokud má někdo rodinný tarif, tak je tato aplikace k ničemu a píše to, že nemáte oprávnění k používání aplikace a musíte použít prohlížeč. Na rok 2020 jsou služby této aplikace silně nedostatečné a podobají se spíše aplikacím z roku 2012. | Bad service, sometimes it doesn't work | Not easy to use in English | Aplikace zcela nefunkční pro firemní zákazníky ... | No English version! | Warum gibt es keine deutsche oder englische Version? Erster Anspruch: 2016!!! Will move to different mobile operator as it's a sign of deeper problems. | Nefunguje zmenit datovy balicek z vyssieho na nizsi. proste peklo. | I paid for 5GB and after few hours, the data vanished from the app. The money was taken from I account but no data and no information. I tried to find a solution with the Customer service but they said it is too complicated to fix it and recommend us to to pay for another phone number !? The worst is that one month ago I paid for 5GB again and they only added 500mb. When I asked for help they say I will have to wait 30days to give it to me back and I was not allowed to get a refund or anything. | Where is the English version please? | Nelze používat pro firemní účet. | Doesn't have English language, useless. I will desinstall it. | Bylo by pekne, aby se dala faktura zaplatit z aplikace. Faktura by mela na sobe mit QR kod s platebnimi udaji. | Proste nefunguje. Nendriv nezobrazovalo stav dat. Den nato zacalo po prihlaseni padat. A dnes se neda uz vubec prihlasit (neocekavana odpoved ze serveru). Je to tak tezky udelat funkcni app? Asi hrozne, hlavne ze jste ""1"", ze. Aplikace akorak k nas*ani, nic vic. Ty 3* mate jen diky historii: fake recenzim a lidem co uz tu app nemaj ale jsou lini reinstalovat a zmenit hodnoceni. P.S. Taky byste mohli konecne udelat ENG preklad, je to otazka par hodin a trva Vam to pres rok. | Příliš pomalá aplikace. Na Samsung J7 dost často trvá samotné přihlášení více než 1 minuta. Přes 3G ve většině případů dojde k timeout. Přes wifi obvykle se dá přihlásit. | gilich | why can't I make an account??? | K nicemu u firemních uctu. Prenesena data nenajdu ani v samoobsluze ani v appce. | I like it | cant log in | If I could update the rating to minus, I would! Still no English option on the app. T-Mobile is my main SIM now. O2 keeps steeling my credit after just a few months of topping up, the app doesn't explain why as it does not show any call history. Purely theft by O2! Does not display in English either, T-Mobile's app is much better with a 12 month rollover credit, I'm switching and never moving back to O2! | please have language options such as English or Tagalog. i know its for local convenience, but please try to understand Czech Republic have a lot of foreign worker. thanks. | Doesn't have English language option, it seems | Pres aplikaci se nelze prihlasit. Odkaz na Chat with O2 guru se na internetu neotevre a nefunguje. Rovnez nefunguje prihlasit se pres telefonni cislo nebo prostrednictvim sms. Applikace odpovida, ""Nelze vam rici co je spatne"". Skutecne ubohe a nejrychlejsi cesta kterou se zbavit zakaznika. | Fungovala dobře. Teď po přihlášení padá. | One point for lack of English support. | internet je uplne na hovno. | Only these incompetent guys can completely break whats is already somehow working. The most pathetic part is that you can't pay them without internet connection. They are so affraid to spare couple Mb for you to access the payment page and give them hundreds $","{""1"":1654,""2"":305,""3"":1552,""4"":6813,""5"":31133}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","O2 Czech Republic a.s.","O2+Czech+Republic+a.s.","aplikace@o2guru.cz","https://www.mojeo2.cz","O2 Czech Republic a.s.

The ad music is really annoying. It might be tolerable if the ads were not the same and didn't play so often. | i love it | Hmmm. There are some good and bad things about the service. The good, well it has all the disney films and the old pre marvel stuff is class. The bad, there are not enough films added and worse of all, is the very limited watchlist. It was always a low limit but overnight this weekend, half the films on the list disappeared so I don't know what i can watch without spending hours trawling through. The only other way is to delete films of the list, which defies the purpose of having a list. | I Love Disney plus the only problem is the price keeps going up. They've got to lower back down if they want people to continue paying no one's gonna pay if it gets too high. not to mention the download limit stinks | Profit driven with little ethical and corporate social responsibility standards. | Otf | One day this app decided to uninstall itself and now I am trying to reinstall it it will not install and so right now this app is useless to me | Really enjoyed it I have had a really good time with the best things ever | Love Disney Plus it has every single show && movie on here shows && movies from since I was a kid ! Streaming is awesome I'm in love with Disney Plus that's why I've paying for it for almost 5 yrs now can't get enough of it ! Absolutely amazing Streaming App | Keeps Crashing! All of a sudden, it crashes the minute I open it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I'm using it on an Android phone. | Crashes all the time | So good | App blocks vpns and such so I can't watch actual good things from another region | I Love this app its a nice app for family and friends to watch together ❤️ I'm sorry if some other people's experiences were bad but mine are great so I do recommend 😊 And it may have some glitches but it's a great app 😄 | I had no problems with the app until recently. When I fly somewhere and try to watch the downloads, the videos don't open! It requires Internet connection to start the video, even though it is downloaded. So if I open downloaded video with data on, and then disable it - all good. But if I want to open video mid flight, when I have no WiFi or data available, video just won't open for me. Useless app, as this is the only reason why I needed an app in the first place. | sux | It's very good..but I have one problem they don't have it in Maltese but thays OK | Disney plus has been one of my favorite platforms to watch TV since I was 8 years old. They have stuff for all age renges and settigs to make it appropriate for any child. Downloads are fast and easy and it is very easy to use. Disney plus has all the Disney shows you could ever want as well as older more mature movies like 10 tings I hate about you, and 27 dresses. Overall I love Disney+ and I will defeetly continue to use. | I want to be able to delete programmes off continue watching list if I decide I don't like, but there is no option to do this, so they just sit there. Disney + really should add this on as an option, all other platforms to it. | It's not opening in my phone | All the classics, all the new goodies,and everything in between. | It will not open. It keeps closing. | Sadly since most recent update doesn't open | Will no longer launch | Crashes sometimes and doesn't always save your place of where you last watched an episode. | asked for feedback, got it. | When will this Disney available in Cambodia? Please make it happen 🥺 | what is going on? can't get the app to let me reset my password... so I can't log on to Disney+ on any of my devices. | Will not open | amazing app <3 | This app was so enjoyable and easy to work around. Until the recent update. When I load the app, the continue watching section isn't there, and when I search the show I was watching it doesn't have where I was up to saved. When the shows are there, new problems occur. Such as when I click on the icon to continue watching a film or a TV episode, it buffers and I have to reboot my phone as I can't even exit the app. Can these problems please be rectified soon. | I love it | Disney no longer streams between 11pm and 5am | Ycra8 t+++⁰⁰, | Eu amo assistir Marvel e todo tipo de coisas na Disney+, melhor app de séries e filmes! | Clearly | Amazing | keeps loading | It's all what the name is. Enjoying and easy operated | love it | People work hard for their money. Please at least make sure the app works...sometimes it wont let me change current movie i am casting i have to fast forward the movie right to the very end before it will even try and cast a different movie or series very annoying | App did an update and now just closes as soon as you open it | Better movies in the past. | 110quid a year? Jog on. cancelled! | I have a bundle deal with hulu and Disney and Disney makes me reset my password constantly. This screws up my hulu. I haven't shared any usernames. F()ck Disney they are a trash partner to a good service. | I'm disappointed on how the payment plans has changed over the years. First of all last time I thought I cancelled my subscription and wondered why I was still being charged monthly! Maybe a glitch in there system? Decided to sign up for 1 month only recently and somehow it signed me up for a year instead! Again glitch in system? There are 3 options to pick and it looks like by default it's set to a year so beware when choosing the option and make sure the right one you chose is correct. | The app is really good and has all the classics. | I uninstalled and reinstalled several times already but the app just would not work suddenly. It cannot even open these days. What is the point of subscribing to something that don't work?! | Great! lots to watch and doesn't take up alot of data! | App won't open. | The app is so good | App on Android keeps crashing. | Useless app.. It simply won't run. It constantly crashes upon opening. | keeps crashing | App is broken. It was working fine but for the last several days when you try to play an episode of a show it gets stuck on the same episode and won't let you play a different one. Downloading the content results in an error about it not being available in my region even though it is. I can't leave feedback in the app since that causes an error also. | It charged my mom's subscription for $300 for some reason | ✨Why do ads load in the background of content? Why play them before I've chosen my desired show or film? Play ads during ad time, not at all times, please. This happens with both apps, Disney and Hulu. Stop this. Not everyone has unlimited internet and you're fully aware of this fact. Remediation required. It says with ads, not ads sitting in the background loading relentlessly as you're also playing the show. Do the advertisers know this? Be more considerate of your clientele. Both us and them. | constantly forces updates which make it slower and buggier. why are companies always moronic in trying to control their customers. | Not happy with the notifications, If you're going to send junk notifications categorize them so we can block them, now I've had to block all general notifications. Also not happy with the $4 price increase, streaming is too expensive when they all start increasing prices year after year. There's plenty of alternatives that are cheaper or free. | love it | 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | it has kid friendly shows I'm 9 and I love Disney this is my review so don't take this review | There needs to be a way to block certain shows, I shouldn't have to turn it down to the baby shows just to block certain inappropriate shows in each rating level. Also, it constantly logs out on laptops, tvs, and phones | Why Disney not working you can't even pull up the app | I love your shows but my one question is why is the Beauty and the Beast movie that good but when I checked the date it was 1991 when I checked the other movie the spring one it was weird it was all pixelated is better in the 1991 yes better and I'm telling you the day of the movie the one I'm speaking about baby and the Beast the spring I think it's called 1998. | Every time try to open it kicks me. I have updated the app but it is still NOT working. | Awesome 👌 | It won't let me renew my subscription it's goes into a loop that doesn't stop so I have no way of renewing my subscription | it good | Asquerosa | App won't even open. | Monthly payment price just increased by 4AUD. Absolutely absurd price gouging. | Andor is amazing...encourage this! | fun af | Some problems, A little too much to list , but the most common are the desyncs / disconnects from the device whole casting and a black screen with some sort of null error. Most aolveable by restarting the device. Simply restarting the app does not solve anything sadly. Bit of a inconvenience, restarting phone every time I need to interact, but it still works. Disney plus tends to bug out from time to time, self correcting within a few days. Hoping it's just having one of its ""moments"" | App would not load, device kept suggesting to try to open Disney+ again later. | It's good but can yall add dragon ball to the Hulu category please? | Content is great, but I don't know what the hell you all did to your app, now all it does it crash every single time. Was working great, now sucks. | this the best streaming app out for havɓĥhhhing shows and movies from kid's to adults and families | Disney is so woke! I just can't give them anymore of my money and I definitely don't want my child watching anything they promote these days. Shame on Disney for trying to corrupt minors. You deserve whatever is worse than the maximum punishment for the worst crime imaginable! | Disney nolonger Value for money nor do they uphold the ethics of Ŵalt Disney | I am loving it | Can't even open the app! Paying a monthly fee and can't even use the app on the television or the phone. No update needed, just not working. | content is great, many crashes and stalls with the android app | I think disney+ is a great app to watch movies! | It's ok but I like it but ever since Hulu was added it has been freezing and taking a little longer to load and it doesn't have One Piece. | when you download something, the sound dosn't work | kids love it | cool | Cannot open the app. | I love Disney+ but since the last update I can't even get it to open without crashing! | It's the end of another long day. Kid has been whiney and fussy. It's finally time to watch TV before bed. Except, I can't! The app has never heard of me or the movie I'm trying to watch before. Every day I have to scrub forward to where we left off the day before. Abandoning vhs was a mistake. | After the last update, app does not even open!! | Disney jumps up price again , this time from $12 to $17 a month ! Disgusting greed disney ! I hope others show their disgust and delete and cancel subscriptions. | Won't open on my Android devices like Xiaomi... | It's a horrible app I can't get it to update on my TV. It worked before but now it keeps stopping..... | Poor app. The variety of content is good but the app just sucks, especially when casting. At times it'll show the content is unavailable in your area message, I have to restart the app and my Chromecast several times to fix it, previously watched just picks itself randomly and still no continue watching option during bingeing a TV show like prime has. The home screen crashing which crashed my Chromecast has finally been fixed at the expense of everything above. | App is pretty good, but a bit buggy across devices. For example, some episodes of The Simpsons play perfectly fine on my Pixel, but on my Lenovo tablet the same episode won't play. If it was every episode, I'd get it. But it's random episodes. No consistency. Done the usual. Cleared cache. Uninstall then reinstalled etc etc. Still issue persists. Weird behaviour. | Ads ads ads ads ads. I have the deal of Disney plus for $2 a month and I can't justify even that price for ads. | Rubbish, keeps just freezing during episodes and films | Great 👍 | All or most all of the disney librarie in one place. New content coming out will be amazing and disney is putting all efort in make the app work. The video quality looks better then netflix as well. | Poor, sorry, no extremely poor not a patch on Netflix, locks up, doesn't remember where I got to in a series. Chromecast works sometimes. | Cannot log in, keeps flashing screens | I love this I can watch the eras tour movie!! | Crashing...doesn't work...fix it!!!! | No mean girls or teenage cracken?!! | Won't install. The app was working fine then I was forced to have this update however it keeps failing the install. Now I'm wasting the cost of my subscription and will need to quit. | Its good quite good there are lots of new great movies and tv series that i rate massively, and over all its a good app | Dis Card | Love that I can watch all the Star Wars, Marvel and the old Disney movies that I grew up on. It's Amazing!!!!!! | Great time | good | I like it | App update requested, updated and now it won't start | Poor quality 😞 | Unlimited hotel and food accommodation | It even has old shows and old movies and it has something where you can find stuff just by taking in to your remote! | Just crashes when I open it now | I can never watch Disney on my mobile phone . Just keeps asking me to update it | Crashes | Really good, just needs an auto play feature. | As much as I like Disney+, what happened to the no-ads option for just Disney Plus? I would really like to see that again. | I have always loved Disney Movies he was / is talented and his Movies are all well made he picks the best Actors for his characters. Man was a genius in deed! 🙏❤️😊🥰 | Marvelous | its a lot of disney movie in one place! I can watch from anywhere to, but it is really hard to do a groupwatch and especially on tv. on my phone I cant do groupwatch because it lags to bad, but otherwise its a great app. | crashes every time i try to open the app, so i constantly have to uninstall it | I can watch offline!! it sucks!!!! | The best because I can watch Disney wherever I go | amazing | Lab Rats Bree 1.95x Speed | Was going to sign sack up for a month. Then... ""update payment information"" apparently means ""we will run your card for $118 without warning or ever displaying the total being charged."" Thank God my cc company stopped it. Turds. | LIKE LREAN LOVE DISNEY GOLD TRUSER PHAROAHLS MONEY OR GOLD | Randomly stops working and have to contact customer service every time to get working again and the staff mostly have been really poor at fixing. Never had an issue with any other service | Legalworke. I simply client'mom sun s.55. To 56winsin city us | IT LITERALLY ENTERTAINS ME ALL DAY WHEN I AM BORED I GO STRAIGHT TO DISNEY+ SO THANK YOU | woke rubbish | App doesnt even load - Xperia 1 ii on Android 12 | While the app does a decent job showing content, it's not adept at showing offline content. I'm sure that in some circumstances it can show content that was downloaded for offline viewing, but not any time I've tried to use it. The app insisted on needing a connection which it wasn't going to get as I was on a long haul flight over the Atlantic at the time. I wasn't about to pay the airline $20/£20 to let the app phone home so I could watch content I'd downloaded only four hours before. | App is unusable at the moment. Asks to be updated all the time and then doesn't work .can we get a refund? Very frustrating | Slow, glitches, downloads do not work half the time if there is no internet. Log in is a mess. | App keeps crashing | broken. broken broken. cant even open app. uninstaol. reistanll. nitjing like paying for a servide we csnt use | app keeps crashing | Love it has absolutely everything | Not on par with functionality from other streaming apps. However, biggest issue for me personally is 4:3 shows like early seasons of Simpsons cut and cropped to fit in 16:9, missing a lot of great detail/context. It would be better to keep 4:3 and show pillar boxes. It's been raised by many since Disney+ was launched in 2020, but no movement on fixing it. | Lower your prices","{""1"":492558,""2"":114682,""3"":158322,""4"":438430,""5"":2584577}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 199.00 - CZK 2,390.00 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","Disney","Disney","disneyplushelp@disney.com","https://help.disneyplus.com","500 South Buena Vista Street

A bug fix here. An update there. We hope you find your streaming experience even better.","[""App is pretty good, but a bit buggy across devices. For example, some episodes of The Simpsons play perfectly fine on my Pixel, but on my Lenovo tablet the same episode won't play. If it was every episode, I'd get it. But it's random episodes. No consistency. Done the usual. Cleared cache. Uninstall then reinstalled etc etc. Still issue persists. Weird behaviour."",""Some problems, A little too much to list , but the most common are the desyncs / disconnects from the device whole casting and a black screen with some sort of null error. Most aolveable by restarting the device. Simply restarting the app does not solve anything sadly. Bit of a inconvenience, restarting phone every time I need to interact, but it still works. Disney plus tends to bug out from time to time, self correcting within a few days. Hoping it's just having one of its \""moments\"""",""App is broken. It was working fine but for the last several days when you try to play an episode of a show it gets stuck on the same episode and won't let you play a different one. Downloading the content results in an error about it not being available in my region even though it is. I can't leave feedback in the app since that causes an error also."",""Content is fine but of all the streaming service apps on my phone, this is by far the worst especially when casting to a TV. The app frequently doesn't keep track of progress. Skipping intros / recaps has to be done on your phone rather than TV (why???). Likewise if you want to skip to next episode when the credits role, you'll need your phone again. Random error messages, buffering bar randomly appears even when it's not buffering. Disney please view other apps to inspire you to improve your's."",""Poor app. The variety of content is good but the app just sucks, especially when casting. At times it'll show the content is unavailable in your area message, I have to restart the app and my Chromecast several times to fix it, previously watched just picks itself randomly and still no continue watching option during bingeing a TV show like prime has. The home screen crashing which crashed my Chromecast has finally been fixed at the expense of everything above.""]",false,false,false,"com.disney.disneyplus","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.disneyplus&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Is your colour coding is appropriate? Hope you would define the different colours of the clouds.here we don't have snow.most areas of India don't have it. | Very helpful | Your weather updates going good | Needs ""track up"" option. I hate North up. Track up is like the navigation programs we are used to. I'd love to see this overlay over Google maps. | The colors need fixed. Any other radar blue is snow, not rain. It's misleading as well when it show ""rain"" above me and it's sunny out and not a drop falling | Good app | Very dependable app, I love it 😊 | Great app. The only remark, the application is not the same on the Samsung mobile phone and on the Cubot mobile phone, the widgets are not the same and the design and shape of the application is not the same. maybe it could be adjusted somehow... But accuracy of weather in app is 95% and that is great for the workers and sailors | Violation of cookie consent, can't reject all marketing data. | Good | Too many ads can't afford on a pension to pay weather side of app brilliant but have had some with scantily buxom ladies which is unacceptable | Pretty accurate from my location | Very goothed detals | Nic | Thank you weather and radar | Issue related network exists.mudt work on slow network. | Very much accurate about rain and it is also showing the cloud map so nice 😊 | The main advantage of this app is the Android Auto support, which is great.

You can't plan anything. For example today forecast a bit of drizzle in the morning. Then mainly cloudy with some sun. It rained all day. You can look at the app say 8am it says dry all day. Look an hour or so later and it's completely changed. I rely of the forecast for work.

How many more are you going to attempt to stuff into this? A non-skippable add as soon as you open the app? Then not to mention how bad it is at updating weather forecast when a unexpected event happened and the current temperature is like 5 degrees C out from where it should be.

Would be five stars if I could change the color of the selector on the screen in the car to make it easier to see. Right now you can hardly see which selection (layers, settings, zoom in/out, etc.) you're making because the ring around the outside of the button almost perfect matches the background. Other than that this app is perfect on Android Auto. Great information, accurate, easy to understand, perfect for seeing what you're driving into or through."",""I've in Bournemouth and find this app very unreliable. You can't plan anything. For example today forecast a bit of drizzle in the morning. Then mainly cloudy with some sun. It rained all day. You can look at the app say 8am it says dry all day. Look an hour or so later and it's completely changed. I rely of the forecast for work. Hopeless."",""I like most of the features, but there's way to many ads. I realize that ads are the reason this app is free, but there's still way to many ads and they're way to big. Some of your pictures, that tie into your locations aren't even representative of that location. For instance, for my location this morning, Toledo, Ohio, is a picture of Adrian, Mich., a city about 20 miles away from Toledo and only a quarter the size of Toledo. Is this the only picture that you could find? Come on!"",""I used the app with Android Auto and it's off to a good start! I was pretty much able to follow the sky conditions and the map provided was OK to drive and follow with route numbers and state lines. I couldn't use split screen...that would be nice. Also, a compass would be nice. Good start! I didn't test it fully, but look forward to finding more features."",""Ok, it works with android auto, but it's very limited. Also, in my particular vehicle, it won't split screen. The color scheme is terrible. Blue is for snow...not rain. If they want to be different, at least give the option to have different color schemes. I've noticed the current day's weather is off. It's almost as if it is looking at the previous day. As for future forecasts, their guesses are about on par with other apps, but sometimes they also show up a day off.""]",false,false,false,"de.wetteronline.wetterapp","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wetteronline.wetterapp&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Needs an uninstall option. | Will not work on s23. Continues to say update | Its convenient | Takes forever to start to transfer | Got my new phone and this app keeps getting hung on an update, so I can't transfer my data until I update it, and it won't work. Ridiculous. | Not applicable. Data moving from other phone | Hard to Uninstaller | How do I uninstall when I'm being Mirrord | Wouldn't connect. | Great. | Way better than Motorola phones | It's great ! I'm glad l found it. | Great app | Osm | Good | So fast and reliable | RUBBISH !!!!!! | Amazing | not compatible with galaxy a12 | Good | Worked perfectly 🥰 | Garbage! I should have the option to remove this garbage | Excellent | Hacked | I have to give it 1 star simply because Samsung does not allow us to select the location on my phone's SD card to backup to, and after backing up, no information is given where it is. I've looked in my sd card, can't find it. Ridiculous. I don't want to back up using this silly app some more or I'll just clog up my sd card with invisible Samsung backups. And there isn't even a 'restore' option given. For goodness sakes. | This app never works. Piece of garbage | Best App to transfer A-Z all data from one Samsung phone to another Samsung phone. You can transfer you call log, Contacts, Mail accounts, photos, vedios and all other data through 1 click . Very helpful ☺️☺️ | Great | Ok | Ready and easy to use | Best this app | Good aps | Overall, good Samsung Smart switch is very simple and straightforward if you want to switch from one to another at the touch of your fingertips. Would definitely recommend this app to friends and family. | Delete | Did not let me use it | I'm interesting the game but were the money I'm getting to get now | Sucks | Server address | Works as expected, easy and fast to use | Great 👍 | Good | Edit: it works! Thank you for the developer response. This app works. Doesn't work. Made me update smart switch on my old device several times. I tried doing it over computer as well. | Awesome thanks | 5 stars | My phone's screen went blank. How can I recover data from my old phone? | Great great | Stop installing yourself | ""Transfer all"" doesn't transfer samsung notes... seems like a pretty big thing to overlook. My transfer from the s8+ to s21 ultra moved the notes fine, but s21 ultra to s24 ultra didn't. I didn't have to use my notes until I wiped and sent samsung my old phone. 12 years of notes gone because ""transfer all"" doesn't transfer all... | Can't updste on my new S24 Ultra | Good | You can't uninstall this app it stays on your phone and there is no way to get rid of it there is no uninstall for this app | Ok | नीस ब्रो | Never have used this. | Good | Keep smart features | Samsung insists that this app will automatically backup my Galaxy watch but that's a complete lie. I have all settings correct yet my watch will not back up. FIX IT NOW SAMSUNG!! GIVE ME BACK THE MANUAL BACKUP BUTTON OR I'M SWITCHING TO APPLE!! | ,. Rtu T. T..? Rw. . | love it great app | Fantastic! | Thank you, I'm definitely going to ask some questions about things I can do to trigger backups. I got it to restore my watch thankfully. | My phone galaxy s10 plus was run over by a car. I can't get the code for the 2 step varification. How can I download its content | Worst app ever | Excellent | flawless contact transfer, no cable needed! | Got my data transfered all good | Im | 👍. | Worked fine and quickly. Thank you! | Great app | J ja gihhizg | Good | I recommend you do not download this app it is a total waste of time and is Spyware by Samsung Korea avoid this download you do not need it you'd be better off transferring by cable. | Unusable for backup because it cannot deal with partial permissions. If it isn't installed, it triggers periodic notificarions. This is just bad deaign. Please fix. | I already downloaded two apps for this watch (Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Health). A third app for one device seems more like marketing/sales motivation, than an actual need. Feel like it is time to move away from Samsung devices. | Non use | ✌️good | No you can't Install appliances from a unknown source!!! What is wrong with this app:( ERROR ) | Gof | Hbllo | Got my new 24+ phone. Tried to transfer from S20 FE. The new 24+ says it needs to update Smart Switch. I try to update and it hangs showing ""Pending..."". Not impressed. Samsung you want your $1500 phone back. I can easily go with a Google phone. | Very good | Excellent Greatest | Used to remote access phone by rogue Google developer | Have a little trouble getting in but on some men. I'll let you know how much I like it thank you | Fast! N Easy! | Only used a couple of times haven't got to use it recently | Good | Why u adding additional apps to download? No need | Samsung | why can i not update this application? | Didn't get Gmail notifications once I transferred from galaxy tab a9 to s23 ultra. I reset s23 to factory settings, and it works fine. I won't trust the app anymore because I missed an important email. Please test your app before release. | Samsung Galaxy Watch backup requires this app, yet it is not clear why I need to give the App full level of permissions to almost any kind of action + data change on my phone (not watch). It's also not giving you clear information about the full scope of data changes it would be doing... I'd give minus stars if it was an option and this would probably be the reason to switch to another brand in the future, unless this is timely resolved to an acceptable level. EDIT: Dev not even understanding... | Good | Won't back up unless all permissions on phone are given regardless if the watch even uses the feature. Won't backup if at least 20% of battery on phone. I can see it saying may not fully backup but this is ridiculous. | I've lost connection trying to transfer data from my iPhone to my new phone about 5 times. I had to wait hours for it just to tell me at the end the connection is lost. Find a better way to transfer data from my iPhone to android because this app is useless. I've lost connection using the wire on my phone, which doesn't even make sense because it's connected through the wire. Also, the wireless option doesn't ever work because it never connects to my phone. So I can't even use it as an option. | Horrible. Would not update. | This takes forever | Useless kept trying to update,only downloaded an hour before gave up and downloaded about 50 apps manually ,first day with my new Samsung never had any problems with my Nokia!! | 👍 | app connection doesn't work. never has caught calls. Displaying "" hit a snag "" SHUTTING DOWN. Will not allow me to reinstall the app. Will not BE ABLE TO USE THIS APPLICATION FOR THE PURPOSE IT IS INTENDED. GETTING ANGRY !!!!!! | Zašto ne omogućite ""ignore"" ako ne ""uninstall"", ali ne samo za ovaj app već za hrpu koje su nametnute, a od prvoga dana pa niti nakon godinu dana nisu jednom korištene, već samo zauzimaju prostor i živciraju kod ažuriranja app koje želim ažurirati? Naročito za app koje Samsung nameće, a ne želim ih ili ste sami proglasili ne-kompatibilnima. Uskoro i Vi čete morati odblokirati poput Iphonea kad EU komisija naredi i naplati kazne. Samsung A52 , UI 6.0, Android 14 | I no longer have the Galaxy A54 5-G nor do I have Motorola moto G pure I only moto G Play by Verizon wireless | Smooth | Disgusting. | Thanking for you | Super easy not sure about my data yet but sweet app | Used up all available space. Not needed and problem mattic to delete. | my device has failed (not broken, physically it's intact) screen, and I can use it only in DEX mode. Smart Things is not opening in this mode so absolutely useless to recover a phone with failed screen | Bloatware | I submitted my card info to be able to use my phone as a remote, even though it stated my card would not be charged, it was! Two transactions of a total of $65 were attemped. Dont use this app. Its a fishing scam. | Wow. Samsung cares less about customers than I imagined. Videos, web browsing are all inhibited inexplicably. Photos and videos are on ""samsumg cloud"" which is no longer accessible. | Okay | You do not 2ork | Ok | Bad | Great | Excellent | Literal clowns. Backup on the PC hangs with only 1.5 GB of data to transfer. The high frequency audio? Doesn't work. Connect via Wi-Fi? Nope, even on the same network. This app is a joke and the devs should never be allowed to code again. Edit: After purchasing a cable just to transfer my data, your app then only copied one of four accounts. SmartSwitch also only functioned at all when my Pixel's new phone procedure forced it to. Trying to use it again to get other data? Nope. GARBAGE APP. | Best app to data transfer | Good | Does the job , it would be best if you could transfer even all login details but I get the security. At least make an option with 3 step verification or something | Again and again , throw this app | Not getting connected | sangat membantu saat perpindahan data dari suatu perangkat ke perangkat lain, tapi sayangnya saya tetap ada kehilangan suatu data penting tidak ikut terpindahkan sudah terlanjur format data pada perangkat sebelumnya 😭 | Worked fine as it should be several times. Can't complain. | Back it up, back it up, back it up now. 🙌 | I keep uninstalling the update and even clicking the auto update off, it keeps reinstalling and updating itself. Whoever made this needs to hang themselves for abusing a system | Good | Fast and easy. I would highly recommend this app . | good apps | I am used to my Google. It really stinks that I am NOT able to use my phone because your app will NOT...... let ME connect to my own WIFI!! It has been 9 days now. I've had Samsung phones before & never downloaded your app We should always listen to our instincts. I am NOT able to uninstall your app Just disable it. WHAT!! WHY?? | Now used | Good app | Doing the job! | Update doesn't work. Wasted time | Very good application | If there's a reason why congress should manage Google this is it | Extant | Irrelevant | Really good. | I dont want this app. I dont have cable or wifi. I am only on mobile phone. Only this phone as i am posting this rating now. | I can't use it | Won't update | not user friendly | Thank you for simplifying this experience:) | App installed with an update and can't be uninstalled.

"Moje VZP","My VZP is a mobile app that allows you to check your insurance payments, payer history, or a summary of the reported treatment conveniently from one place. It is intended for all VZP insured persons who want to communicate with us electronically and do not like to go to a branch office. You can easily register your entire family and check the data of all its members from one account.

To use My VZP services, you can:

For yourself.
For your children.
As a guardian.

As an agent, for example, your spouse, grandparents, parents or anyone else who can give you an officially authenticated power of attorney.

What do you find in your app?

Overview of health insurance payers. Check who is paying for your health insurance premium. And who paid you for the last 5 years.

State of health insurance payments

If you are paying for yourself or have ever paid health insurance premiums (such as self-employed or self-employed), make sure you do not have any arrears or discrepancies in your payments.

Survey of Income and Expenses

We enable self-employed individuals to provide a VZP Point bonus application with an overview of the income and expenses of the self-employed without having to visit our branch or send it by post.

Overview of Health Care Payments

Find out what health care you received from healthcare facility reports, and how much that care was. You may also notice any discrepancies.

Charges and supplements

Check the amount of your deductible supplements for medicines and food for special medical purposes, taking into account the statutory limit of protection, after which additional payments will be refunded within the statutory period.

Access to the data of our insured persons can only be made on the assumption that we have active insurance (not completed under EU or long-term insurance). You do not have to be our insurer to set up a crowd, but we will be glad to do so.","My VZP is a mobile app that allows you to check your insurance payments, payer history, or a summary of the reported treatment conveniently from one place.

It will same as it is | Oproti ostatnim bankam je svizna, prehledna a ma slusnout pouzitelnost. Neni preplacana tisicem featur, ktere pouziva tak 1% uzivatelu a nevyskakuji na me na kazdem screenu 3 raklamy jako napriklad v katastrofalni aplikaci od Monety. Prosim jen o pridani featury potvrzeni hromadnych plateb v telefonu. Myslim, ze pro hodne podnikatelu, kteri resi 90% businessu na telefonu by to bylo vysvobozeni. Takhle se platby zpozduji, protoze musim lezt do webove verze a to je opravdu opruz. | With George, there's no dull moment, always fun with George . | Excellent Services | Great app, great bank. They really try to make it user-friendly but it's also secured. | Better without key | Works great | Aplikace funguje hezky, je přehledná rychlá. Ale jak prosím zruším notifikace týkající se finančního zdraví? Opravdu je nechci vidět co dva dny v systému, ideálně ani v aplikaci. Hledám pod ikonou profilu, bohužel nikde žádnou volbu/položku Tipy od George nevidím. | Fast and easy | Good | Kompletně funkční, rychlá, spolehlivá a moderní. Maximální spokojenost. | Great tool | Good | Access to the app is blocked by some sketchy form. So I can not access my account through this. | Tato aplikace je strašná.Naprosto chaotické umístění funkcí (např. umístění zaplaceni přes QR někomu a naopak platba od někoho přes QR jsou v úplně jiné části;proklikat se na autorizovaný hovor je čistý horor, misto aby jako v normální appce toto bylo na 2 kliknuti).Po zaplaceni na internetu a potvrzeni v George nelze aplikaci ukončit a kliknuti na ukončení vyžaduje prihlaseni do bankovnictví.Vynucování George jako jediné autorizační aplikace mitiguje vrstvu ochrany (2 oddělená zařízení). | 👍🙂... | very good | Still like this app. Unfortunately had to move from Czech, but that was a good experience. Thanks developers | All you need at the tip of your finger | A special update to be able to put on the rainbow icon?! The question arises, does the development team really not have more important things to do? | Osm app | Dneska už víceméně použitelná aplikace. | úprava s nejčastějšími kontakty při odeslání platby někam zmizela. jelikož tuto featuru používám docela často,opět měním hodnocení P.S. pokud kliknu na New transfer -> manual transfer -> dostanu se na seznam kontaktů pro odeslání platby. V poli ""most used contacts"" mám random kontakty, které jsem využila třeba jednou v živote, místo toho, abych tam měla kontakty které využívám docela často. Již jednou se tato sekce opravovala a fungovala jak má. Teď je to zas rozbitý | Good app | It is ok | I think the app has improved so significantly since I first started using it. Nowadays, it's very intuitive and I am very glad that klic and George are now combined into one. It's much less of a hassle when trying to approve a payment. | Awesome 👍🏻😎 dekujeme | Dvě velké špatné: Při potvrzování platby není zobrazen variabilní a specifický symbol. Aplikace uživatele odhlašuje po velmi krátké době neaktivity bez možnosti tuto dobu prodloužit. | Всё круто | Velmi dobré | Good | Naprosto tragický produkt, vše špatně, nepřehledné, nemožnost najít cokoliv. Zkouším několik let se v něm vyznat, ale nejde to, a každé jejich ""zlepšení"" je jen zhoršení už tak uživatelsky nepřívětivého produktu! Jsem u ČS přes 30 let, ale kvůli nesmyslnému Georgi budu nucena přejít do jiné banky. Otřesné, jak dokáží uživatelům znepříjemnit život 😕 | New version 23.46.9 keeps randomly crashing, all previous ones worked well. | Satisfactory | Excellent | Skvělá aplikace. Jednoduché a intuitivní GUI. Žádné zbytečnosti. | Perfect. Just love how easy it is to work in this app. | Wonderful so far | V nove verzi prestal spravne fungovat scan qr kodu. Musim s telfonem hybat a otacet (jine qr scannery kod nactou). Pak nejaky chytrolin vymyslel, ze nastavi defaultni realizaci platby pri scanovani qr podle data splatnosti. Takze chcete zaplatit faktury a surprise mothefu***rs! platby odejdou az za 14 dnu. | Aplikace George je pro milovníky trénování pevných nervů. Je šíleně pomalá, při načítání samotné appky a při dívání se na logo G byste zvládli zhlédnout všechny série Her o trůny (a pomalým zařízením to nebude). Kvůli 'bezpečnosti' musíte při téměř každém tapnutí zadávat svůj PIN, což mi osobně přijde kontraproduktivní, je zde mnohem větší riziko, že si toho náhodný kolemjdoucí všimne. A pak.. jsem bez netu na mobilu, chci se přihlásit na PC. Aha. A jak, když přihlášení musím potvrdit na mobilu? | Pretty solid actually. The smoothest banking app I ever used | Perfect tool very happy | The bank that blocks your funds the second you need them | Excellent | Easy to use :) | Od doby, co ČS spojila ověř. klíč s Georgem je appka naprosté peklo - při zadání PINu opakovaně padá, potvrzení platby kartou může trvat klidně 10 minut jednoduše proto, že opakovaně spadne, následně je třeba podstoupit retardovaný zdlouhavý ověřovací proces, než se George tzv. opět nastaví, mezitím se platba zruší kvůli nezabezpečené autentizaci, následně ale George nabídne potvrzení utomaticky zrušené platby a můžete zahájit celý proces znovu. KWA udělejte s tím něco, nebo klíč opět oddělte. | Nice application. | Great I am very happy this app excellent | Very confusing interface. Slow AF. I'm looking forward to changes which will make even worse of course. | It works as I need | Very good app. Very functional and easy to use | S aplikací nejsou žádné problémy | It works. | Vcelku pěkné. Řazení karetních transakcí by mohlo být podle data provedení, speciální kategorie čekající na zaúčtování (na úplně zvláštní obrazovce) a samotné datum zaúčtování mě popravdě moc nezajímají, jen to vše znepřehledňuje. Raději bych jeden seznam s případnou poznámkou, pokud něco není zaúčtováno. | Naprosto neintuitivni a nesmyslna app :/ | Špatné, melze ani poslat platbu z účtu! Ani zobrazit a stáhnout historii v csv nebo xls. | Amazing and comfortable app | So far i do like this George app. Mainly that it's simple to use for someone who is not so much in nowadays technologies. Also, what I like about it is, that when i purchase some thing, the massage come immediately that i have made purchase. Plus the convenience of making payments, hopefully it will work from outside of euro-continent. | Good fast transaction | Excellent ⭐ | Perfektni servis!! | Excellent, easy and user friendly | Za mě super aplikace | The good one. I like it. | The app works okay, but still is missing a lot of functions, especially if you are coming from a bank that has very rich features like Tatra Banka Slovakia. George feels compared to Tatra Banka's app stuck in early 90s while their app is keeping up with current trends. For example: Why it's not possible to round up savings in % manner? Why am I able to put aside only 30CZK from every payment? I want to be able to put from every payment I make 20% aside, simply in George it's not possible... | Aplikace nefunguje korektně jako klíč, je-li otevřená, požadavek na ověření se nezobrazí. Nutno aplikaci zabít a znovu spustit. | Very good | By far the best mobile banking app, I tried out so far. | Works great in most of the time. Never had a problem with the app. | Chybí zobrazení blížících se plateb, a proto musím (chci) stále používat webovou verzi. Při verifikaci přihlášení přes web nejde rozumně odejít a vnucuje se přihlášení do appky. Také tam každou chvilku zdržují nějaké krásné animace, takže appka působí pomalá. Při poruše telefonu (v zahraničí) jde appku v novém zařízení rozběhnout až po telefonátu s podporou (dost si počkáte), takže jsem byl dočasně úplně odříznut od svých peněz. Jiné banky to mají vyřešené, takže nejde tvrdit, že to nejde. | Much better than in the past!!! | nepadá. za mě by mohla být přehlednější. | Every new update completely breaks everything and i have to re-log multiple times, rarely works without some issue | Pomalé, špatně UX, špatní vývojáři 😎 | zlatý George klíč. NECHCI bankovnictví v mobilu. Potvrzování přihlášení/plateb trvá hrozně dlouho, protože se startuje celý tenhle zbytečný kolos. | İt is a little bit slow but still it is very good | I think it is a decent app. Could be a bit faster when starting-up to confirm payment. And I just don't like passively forcing users to have banking app in their phones. Edit: You may not be aware of, but originally SMS were free of charge. I was told after they were no longer free, so I was passively forced to download your Key app, then to migrate to full online banking. Edit: Not safer, because I must now carry my banking access with me everywhere, and it takes just my finger to do everything | Safe, easy to navigate, best of the available. | Excellent | Smooth and easy transactions | Pretty easy and nice. Looks reliable | Very good! | Ok | Perfect bank out there | This application is pice of code. Worst bank application ever. Worst UI. Unfriendly interface. No required information. Even bank employee don't know how to find the info in this app. | it is constantly improved to be a realy handy banking up. I had no issues with it because it is similar to online banking I am used to | Perfect application, so easy . | ok | Very easy and bilingual. Branch staff at Chodov are very friendly too. | Otřesená aplikace, bohužel pokud nechcete měnit banku tak Vám nic jiného nezbývá | Cannot get it verified/confirmed through the app DoKapsy via Banking IDentity. It keeps failing and says it's not recieving data from the app. | Celkem bezva aplikace, prehledna apod, ale posledni dobou zacala posilat notifikace, treba pri pouziti karty, i kdyz je mam veskrze schvalne vypnute :/ | Fast, easy to use. Is intuitive if unsure as to procedures. | Aplikace stále závisí na George Klíč kterou nelze na vybrané telefony nainstalovat. Zdůvodnění je z důvodu bezpečnosti. Stejný operační systém jako Samsung a jiné. Jiné banky problém s bezpečností telefonů nemají. Bravo ČS. | Best | Bezva funkce ve všech směrech | Great banking app. Thank you George! | Excellent | Máte to zabugované. Když už aplikaci mám otevřenou / používám, a potřebuju v ní potvrdit prihlášení, okno se nezobrazí! Je nutné aplikaci vypnout a zapnout. Teď třeba nejde podepsat prohlášení, protože už v aplikaci jsem, a žádné potvrzení se neobjevilo. | Tohle je asi nejlepší aplikace, co jsem kdy viděl. Je prakticky dokonalá. A ne, nejsem najatej ani bot. | Děkuji za sloučení obou aplikace do jedne! | Chybí mi možnost zadat platbu QR kódem uloženým v telefonu, ne pouze jeho naskenováním kamerou. | 👁👅👁 | Funny application! I just have a new ceska sporitelna credit card, due to a contract transfer, but.. since I am not a czech citizen I cannot uae the app. | Please think about some additional security... I liked using 2 apps, because I was able to use different login method for accessing account data (biometrics is good) and better method for signing (6 digit PIN). Now I have to use the same method for just accessing account info as for signing which makes the method for signing much more vulnerable to attacks! | Líbila by se mi možnost organizace hlavního menu do složek. V případě vícero položek se může zdát nepřehledné. Jinak cajk | just great | Perfektni aplikace prozatim funguje skvele, pouzivam furt a porad funguje super. Je tam vse co potrebuju, a bankovnictvi na pocitaci jsem neotevrela ani nepomatuju, proste super. Porad se zlepsuje , pouzivam ho roky a porad je to sikovna aplikace. Miluju George | Samé chyby bránící založení účtu (technical error, chyba přesměrování), nejde kvůli tomu dokončit KYC. Nejde založit spořicí účet online, prý musím na pobočce? Čekal jsem upřímně víc 🙄 Edit: podařilo se po několika pokusech založit vkladový účet, po zobrazení dokumentů k podpisu a přesunutí aplikace na pozadí se do aplikace již nejde přihlásit, Something went wrong error 🙄 | Pomale a nacita se s chybama porad dokola | Stupid idea to force mobile banking on all users and to use insecure 1-factor authentication! Also why does my bank want to track my location and registering is not possible with location services switched off? Time to switch to a sensible bank. | I like it | Works 👍 great | Nice 👍 | Po aktualizaci George teď všechno běží pouze v jedné aplikaci, výborně! Dřív ten geoge klíč fungoval s velkým zpožděním. | When George and George Klíč were separated, everything worked great, but since 15/11/2023 they merged them in one app and now I am locked out, because I can't login to it, everytime I try to set up the new George authentication, it always fails with some random error. Thanks George for locking me out of my account. | Best bank app so far. No ads or offers clear overview o all products and all functions intuitively accessible. | Nechci mit George app na mobil. Hlavne to pouzivam domu na pocitace. Nutit tu appku na vase zakazniky je povazuji za spatnym krokem. | Sorry jako, ale dříve se SW před vypuštěním mezi lidi testoval. | Kvůli téhle aplikaci uvažuji po více ja 15 letech o nové bance. Upřesňuji: opravdu mi nepřijde rozumné, ba ani bezpečné, nosit úplný přístup k veškerým mým financím s veškerou a absolutní kontrolou nad nimi 24/7 v kapse. Dále mi velice vadí, že nutíte klienty k vlastnictví zařízení třetí strany k instalaci aplikace s výše zmíněným rizikem. | When I had to have George Klic with George, everything worked fine for me, but now when they moved both functionality to single app it broke for me. When I try to migrate George Klic to George, it would just print out some error message with message try again. And this is not the first time this happeneds. when George klic started it didn't worked on my phone, and I was forced to get new phone just to have access to my money. And now again. I'm considering switching bank | QR codes payments stopped working. The issue is present for over a month. | Normál bez problémů, zatím. | Velmi bych uvítal, kdyby v mobilní verzi bylo mezi čekajícími platbami vidět i trvalé platby, jejichž splatnost se blíží (tak jak jsou vidět ve webové vetrzi). Děkuji | Very customer friendly app | V Sony Xperia XA1 zmizel přehled plateb z kreditní karty. Po cca půl hodině se zase objevil. Nespolehlivé. | Bohužel aplikace neumožňuje spoustu věcí, které potřebuju, např. přidělovat dispoziční práva. Člověk musí v jednom kuse létat na pobočku a podepisovat papíry. Chtělo by to upgrade procesů. | Moje první připomínka byla vyslyšena tak to zkusím znovu. Před sloučením aplikací jsem k přihlašování do aplikace George používal biometrii ale k potvrzování v aplikaci George klíč ne. Přišlo mi to jako dobrý kompromis mezi bezpečností a pohodlností. Po sloučení jsem tuto možnost ztratil? Bylo by možné přidat do nastavení možnost zapnout biometrii zvlášť pro přihlašování a zvlášť pro potvrzování? Jinak považuji sloučení aplikací za velký posun. 👍 | Nejlepší internetové bankovnictví v porovnání s konkurencí. Rychlé, pohodlné a jednoduché. | Reklama na půjčku v přehledu produktů je rušivá a podlá. | Super. Everything has been working for me since I opened an account 10 years ago. | It's easy to use and very convenient. | Big, complex, and slow (sometime not functional)... on the other hand seems secure.... | neprehledny spatne funkcni program, objevuji se okna, ktera nejdou vypnout, CSas mi vnutila hruzu, co jsem nechtel. :( | Very, very good application | Easy. | It took almost 3 years (!) to implement payment key into George. Application devs, congrats! Amazing job so far. | Prehledna appka | Ugly UI and terribly unintuitive. Also, customer support will try to convince you that you need your location turned on at all times in order to be able to use the app. | Upravuji původní recenze, tak nevím, jak to bude vypadat... Aplikace každopádně nadprůměrná, uvítal bych ale možnost vytvoření QR kódu v sekci ""platba"" a dále možnost QR kod uložit, pouhá možnost ""sdílet"" je naprosto nedostačující. | Absolutně příšerně fungující aplikace. Jen George jako aplikace je důvod proč změnit banku. | Jen by bylo fajn kdyby se mě přestalo ptát na ohodnocení když už jsem hodnotil bůhví kdy dávno. | Abych se pomocí 2FA mohl přihlásit na webu banky na svém PC, musím uvnitř mobilní aplikace George složitě procházet různé sekce než dojde k samotnému ověření. Chtělo by to proces ověření zjednodušit. Jinak asi dobrá apka. | Easy to use | Perfect | noise | Hra je skvělá, až na to že, Minulý týden jsem hrál hru až osm hodin denně. Měl jsem i milující ženu, ale když mě hra začala přitahovat více než se zajímat o Sáru, odešla. Vzala i děti. A já zkrátka nevím co mám dělat. Každý den i noc probrečím. Sáro prosím vrať se domů. Já bez tebe nemohu žít. Jsi světlo mého života, Jsi tak krásná že i kapky deště se bojí poskvrnit tvou krásu, Jsi ta nejkrásnější ani Helena Trójská není tak půvabná jak ty. Já se změnil, tak prosím Sáro. | Byl jsem donucen nainstalovat si George, protoze George klic bude zrusen. Z bezpecnostniho hlediska naprosto nevhodne mit vse na jednom miste.

And all those animations make it even more annoying. I want to do my business quickly and effectively I don't give a chainshaw about programmers liquid dream about transitioning screens.

ALE nesnáším, když mě po spuštění oslovuje jménem, dokonce i křestním. uvědomte si, že způsob oslovování se velmi různí např. podle věku, sociálních skupin apod. použití špatného způsobu je neodpustitelná chyba. takže radši jen samotné neutrální ""dobrý den"". | Satisfactory | Super | Nice app | Ze záhadného důvodu jsem odhlášen. Při snaze se přihlásit musím zadat metodu přihlášení a po zvolení otiski prstu začne aplikace glitchovat. | Easy to operate | Very good service | dobry | Nejde platba cez QR kód. | Při slučování George a Klíče se v Georgi nezobrazilo ID transakce, takže nebylo co zkontrolovat v Klíči. Při přihlašování do sloučené apky se špatně zobrazuje informace o počtu už vložených číslic- proužek je moc úzký, avšak nadpis je obrovský. Při potvrzování akce Zobrazit PIN není proužek s puntíky podle vložených číslic viditelný už vůbec. Proužek je užší než puntíky, zatímco nadpis Sign with PIN je zbytečně velký. V systému mám zobrazování větších znaků. Prosím opravte. | The setting are great and easy to use . | + Spokojenost (použitelnost, spořicí obálky). - Nenalezena možnost opakovat neúspěšnou platbu. Zdá se, že se systém nepokouší poslat (opět) předtím neúspěšnou platbu. - Počet sporicich obálek limitován na 10. | Klobouček | Works as described | Nice app, I think better than ČSOB and KB applications | Doesn't work with Aurora Store | 👍 | Amazing app. Would love for the products to have English descriptions, but no a big deal. | Skvělá aplikace! | Very good, user friendly, intuitive app. | Easy to use | Best | All works well | Super | Suddenly stopped working with a custom rom. | Proc mam 2 kc na karte | By far the best banking app i've used. | Super | Aplikace mi nefunguje jak má. Zasekává se. Po zadání PIN se vždy ukáže kolečko načítání a poté mě aplikace hodí zpátky na stránku zadání PINu. Nedostanu se ke svým údajům, ani Georgi | best bank app. | 👌👌 | Easy, secure.

Stupid. I AM THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT USES IT. UNO, ONE, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! | OK | I have the new cp20s it's supposed to be compatible with Netflix but is not.

Shopping forvthe service st r eadonable price | very goood | This application is controlling my brightness feature outside of using it. Traced it back to this by it happening only after opening the application and by deleting it to find the problem gone with it :/ | Do I even have to say it? | I love Netflex movies | Ok.., Netflix is Nice.., 👍👊 | It's good | Videos keep having errors! | Doesn't play videos only audio. | I am happy. It good | Seems the last update fixed the 99% download issue. | Love this | Netflix is no longer clear enough in my galaxy even when I opted to stream on maximum data. | Excelente | Got me laid😎 | ""your device isn't part of your household"" yeah nah bugger off. capitalist greed at its finest 👎 | Nothing beats Netflix to my understanding. I know there are other apps but Since The Last Airbender and One Piece can along, nothing is beating Netflix at all. | I pay for the app access and it works. | If you have two wifi accounts good luck bc they will not let you use one other than the one that's preset. All this price increase just to now limit the users they have left? Good luck staying in business when you do this and you cancel all the good shows for new ones! | Dininiz imanınız paradır bırakın film indirmeyi ekran bile yansıtmıyor o yüzden abone olmayı iptal edicem inşallah Cine5 gibi batarsınız netflix | The new change that doesn't allow people of the same family but different households to use the same account is ridiculous. Money hungry for mostly bad TV and movies. | Been good | Naruto dekhne ke liye richarg Kiya tha lekin Naruto ka Hindi dubbed hai hi nhi kya fayda ase app ka Jo dekhna chahte hai uska Hind dubbed hai hi nahi paysa West 😡😡😡 | freezes my devices | If | Very good nice | Excellent | Too 2 short for the Bigg ol raises 4 You. Why do they need to put the customer SERVICE LAST , I WAS TOLD | Good | Love this app | Raised their price, if you are on ad-free they give you movies that you wouldn't get on the cheaper ad subscription. They lock movies unless you pay the extra few dollars to go ad free. Scum company. Piss poor production and content. Screw you guys along with Amazon | Y'all just keep getting worse and worse! Not only does the Android app keep trying to get me to download a whole bunch of old apps that aren't compatible with my device (or most new devices), the overall service (especially the customer service chat-which is the ONLY way to leave feedback) is just godawful. I keep trying to report the fact that their app for Roku simply does not work the majority of the time, and they keep giving me the same help article despite the fact I reported it's N/A! | Household option is silly - what about divorced parents etc? Just makes me not want to buy my own subscription. Gives the idea about being money hungry and not at all caring about customers. | I wanted cancel auto renewal..and it was possible few years ago..and tasked to cancel and restart .nd as i don't use it but my parents di..i don't want to go into all that ..just wanted the cancel auto renewal and would have activated next month ...but the chat process is so pathetic..that they cut offed me and blocked me.and the Netflix does not have a complaint team. It was strange. Akram the supervisor, then Nikhil and then Aditi .they all told me same things and then cut me off.. | My household has devices now so the app is worthless | Price went way too high | Good apps en good video ang update your video thank you Netflix | Not good aap | Really good can watch all you favorite Netflix shows without any trouble doing so and you can also download things to watch offinle | 2024 Netflix Oscars | Enough is enough. No more price rising please. | I cannot add my phone number as a payment option | I can't cast to my TV if I don't pay more?!?! This made me cancel my subscription entirely, SAD! | best app ever created | had to go back and change my review. this brightness control sucks! some movies ade too dark even with that on. | Doesn't work on my PS4 and since they added this ad plan garbage nothing I want to watch is available and I can no longer use my chromecast. I only have it because it's free on my tmobile plan. I would never pay for such a greedy company and I do not recommend Netflix to anyone who would have to pay. The selection is weak at best past the 6 good shows they offer. I have a better variety on Tubi and they let me use my chromecast and it's free. Netflix is a major disappointment. | Esta nala | They've got to be deleting bad reviews lol. No way this train wreck of an app is 4+ stars lmao | I like it because I watch what I like anytime but I hate when you debit my money before my pay date | Love 😍 it | Pay for a service which you are only allowed to use at one establishment. Disgraceful, will terminate my subscription. | Excellent | Fantastic | Why There is no different types of Font styles are there? | Programming has deteriorated over past few years. | I loved Netflix, back when you and your family could all use your different profiles across all your devices without issues. Yeah that's not happening anymore. Oh, and the add free part that was the main reason you watched here over Hulu? That's gone. Now you have to pay extra for no ads, as if the price hadn't been going up consistently already, pay more for certain movies, and if you have more than one device you have to go through a process to use it cause they don't want people sharing. | Whole day i can't connect on my cell phone app ?!?!? Fix that problme thank you ! Angry customer | I what to which church movie's | ...........😊 | I hate this app so much I AM APART OF THE HOUSE HOLD HAVING TO DO THAT EVERY TIME IS UPSETTING ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO WATCH ON MY PHONE I'D GIVE NEGATIVE POINT IF POSSIBLE | Nice app to kill your time | I dont know why but now the app only steams in SD. I have cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstall led many times, updated my phone, restarted the phone several times but the app is stuck in SD. I checled and I still have the HD plan. If I'm not going to get what I payed for then I'll just cancel my membership | Wonderful | Excellent | It's nice but please improve the limit of device while playing vedio whenever I watched in my phone then in tv it doesn't work 😞 | Keeps saying I'm not part of household while I'm sitting in my house on the wifi. Super annoying to type in the code all the time. | Have had netflix for years, and now password sharing had completely ruined it. | Unstable video quality | Slips of a good day for a few days back a little | This app is perfect..... | Netflix has really stepped their up in the movie selection department. Keep up the good work guys 😉 | Blocking content on ads plan. Another Price Increase. Also I think it's the only service I have that charges extra for hd and 4k. Only reason I still have Netflix is because I get a price discount from T-MOBILE. | Netflix is the dumbest service ever. App is sluggish at best, service is worst than 5 years ago, house hold rules on ip that are easy bypassed by a home proxy tunneling, show cancelations without any conclusion. Everything is worst than before at a higher price. Let's invest money in a 60 year old fighting a 25 year old influencer idiot that for sure will resolve retention issues. | Good | Not working | If I download any movie or web series from Netflix and keep the monthly plan after eating it, I cannot watch my downloaded movie or web series, this is very wrong, I have to recharge and watch my downloaded movie, please fix it, this is very wrong. | Watch Temporarily forever! I just want to login and watch shows, but they keep asking for temporary codes cuz I've been traveling alot. Garbage!!! | So good that you my friend's | App is not opening | Goodexperience | So excited 😍 I really love Netflix 😊💐 | You know what to do with your household features. | Netflix keep on rejecting my pament method, although my cards still have sufficient funds. When i try to use telco billing also still keep rejected. | App doesn't want to go any further than the startup. Updated but not working properly. | Terrible experience with the new household nonsense. Dislike Netflix now. | Never had a more invasive subscription service. It's ridiculous how it keeps asking me to use my account in my household WHEN I AM TRAVELING. I live with my grandparents, so they use the service at home. I am always traveling or staying at a friend's home, so I don't understand how it is legal for Netflix to be tracking my location and asking me to connect to my household network to regain access. This is the height of idiocracy. What a terrible, green, soulless company. | Movies | I am not getting the verification code to my mobile no, hence i can't open my account. | Excellent ott | Good | Best streaming platform | Good | Movies always get stuck on ""loading.."". Useless | Great | Not working | Worst!!!! | Netflix is a great app. But there is a problem for me. Netflix doesn't have any popular movies. I mean they should add more movies. Korean actor, Ma dong-seok movies are not available on Netflix. Only 2-3 movies of this actor are available. I really think Netflix should add more movies. | It's not working not ever in browser | The player automatically shifts to small video player and I have to make it full screen over and over again it's very frustrating I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and turning my mobile device on and off but still the problem persists. Please help me find a solution to this problem. | Better than never | I love Netflix! | Those it have to be different movies for different countries? Ain't we paying same amount for subscription? Many movies I needed to watch but it's only available for USA only. That's insane | Wish I could give it a zero. | Fix the brightness issue thats been plagueing android phones. Its abnormally dark even with all brightness seting set to highest, stop saying its a settings issue, THE APP NEEDS TO BE FIXED | Keeps telling my husband to fix the household devices but won't tell him how and since when does NETFLIX HAVE ADS!?!!!!!???? | 👌 | Very good | Super good | What's the point of having an app that lets you watch netflix on a portable device when you have to be connected to a certain wifi | I've been using Netflix for an entire year now and I didn't really encounter any problems until recently. I've been sharing an account with my dad and everything has worked out just fine until I opened the app today and suddenly I'm no longer able to open our shared account because I am not in the same household as my dad, this is extremely inconvenient as I have moved out since June and me and my dad currently live in different areas. | it's the best | Never used | How to watch Lucifer in Hindi | The 260 billion dollar company that charges a subscription now has ads, because greed. | Super nice | There is serious issue with subtitles. Whenever there is music/song in an episode. After the song the subtitles are comiing 20 to 30 secs faster than video. | Love Netflix!!! | ❤️! | Yeah Dog | Worst app 🥺🥺 I will Recharge more than three gp data for watching one movie.🥵🥵🥵.. Full of pug .. I waste my money to subscribe netflix | Sweet | App Widget disappeared | Has highest subscription from Bengaluru. But ignoring Kannada movies. There is no kannada option. Pathetic platform. Does not value customer | please make supernatural available in the Philippines with filipino dub many people will watch it thanks | The inability to manually select quality is infuriating. Literally unwatchable. Further more not allowing me to fully remove the app from my phone is bs. | Waste | Truly a disappointment. My family payed for the most expensive pack only to find difficulties with the new household update. This update is the most impractical update ever, sure it focuses on Netflix's investment but this is a serious problem considering how much we've payed only for this. At this point, Netflix is worthless, have you even considered about students who studies over seas, family members who live in other countries? This update is just unacceptable, not eveyone lives together. | Thank you and GodBless😇 | I hate it. I dont like it when i sign up. I wanted a 0/5 instead. But they can only Do 12345. But not 0. Im not talking about the game rn, im talking about the rating. | They changed Netflix to default to games? Netflix is for tv and movies. Should probably keep it that way? | Unable to run since latest update . Keep loading .. there is a problem playing the video error | When I watch on my tv the resolution is great, but when I play it on my phone it looks like 720p. I can't even do anything about it like choose the desirable resolution. Plz fix the app. | It's been great since bt my issues began yesterday, y'all telling me that I'm using vpn or proxy bt I'm not Again I can stream bt I can't download, how??

I've subscribed to netflix for many years and suddenly I have to pay more for something unusable? Absolutely not. It's much more affordable to buy/rent the digital shows and movies you want from elsewhere. Cancelling greedy low quality Netflix completely. Netflix is a scam."",""Netflix could not possibly make it harder for a household of two to use their service. If you're not a single person with one singular device then goodluck. Update: also recently upgraded to ad-free so that we could cast to a TV. It's ridiculous that you can't cast with ads. I guess Netflix would prefer that people (under same household of course) huddle around a cell phone screen if they're not on board with price increases. Every other competitor doesn't have these kinda issues."",""I updated the app about 3 months ago and since then the app doesn't work properly. The screen freezes but the sounds still goes on, it doesn't update where you left of so you can start the episode over again and if you want to move to where you were the screen freezes again.

Now I can't even cast to any Chromecast device without going through a convuluted process. It seems like you can only Chromecast easily at home but why do you need to use that when the TV has Netflix app? I will just downgrade the subscription to the lowest tier instead.

It is really great, but sometimes it is kind of lagging and not exactly accurate, but it is my number one app for searching mostly for bus connections. If it weren't lagging, i would give it 5 stars, but i do think that 4 stars is still good | Nedoporučuji, stáhněte si radši PubTran, umí všechno co idos ale daleko lépe a spolehlivěji. | Great app and so user friendly and accurate | Looove it | Overall very good, but since a few weeks unable to see details of a train. Instead, there is an endless loading. Please fix) | Podvodně vynucený souhlas na spravování dat. Cynické zneužívání systému. Člověk musí odkliknout 80 individuálních zdrojů kterým prodávají data a pak se stane že apka *náhodou* zapomene a musí celé znova. | Very useful app. Precisely time and route finder. | Nelze zadat datum a čas odjezdu/příjezdu přímo, pouze skrolováním. Při hledání spoje, kterým chci jet za třeba tři měsíce, by mi upadl palec... EDIT A když si chci koupit několik měsíců dopředu jízdenku třeba do Berlína, dokud není vyprodáno a je levnější? Na tyhle případy se tedy aplikace nemá používat? | Excellent app. Easy to navigate the city 👍👍 | Česko-Polsko vlaky fungují haphazardly | The best app | Works flawlessly | Doesn't work half the time | Užitečný pomocník na cestování. Nemožnost placení via Google Playz se kteroi jsem bojoval, vyřešena data resetem aplikace. | Best app for public transport in czech | Idiotic adds..... | Aplikace funguje dobře, ale dark pattern na tahání souhlasu se sdilenim marketingových dat je extrémně otravná. Pokud jednou uživatel řekne, že nemá zájem, je snaha donutit k rezignaci, potažmo čekání, až se někdy ve spěchu uklikne, dost toxická | Works perfect. | Currently, this app does not allow more than one search before having to restart it. When attempting the second search, the app gets stuck on the loading circle. Very frustrating. | Po updatu musím potvrzovat platbu i 22kc v internetovém bankovnictví. | It is a good app, everything works as it should. Good work | I came to Czechia a few weeks ago.I feel like this is the best and smartest transportation app in the world | Redesign navigationbaru je půl bídy (beru jako postupy proces), ale tlačítko koupit (kosik s cenou) jízdenku ve vyhledávání, je tedy dost nevzhledně pozicovan | Perfect. | EDIT: Idos stále těží z někdejšího Babišova monopolu. A co se Vašich reklam a cookies týče, zaplatil jsem za zrušení reklamy. Přesto v nastavení nadále vidím zhruba 200 serverů, se kterými potenciálně sdílím data. Polovina z nich nejde zcela zakázat... Je těžké věřit Vašemu tvrzení o tom, že tyto nejsou využívány, když se s každou aktualizací volby mění. Nepůsobí to transparentně ani důvěryhodně... | Awesome | Appka má velice nepřesné odjezdy | Comportable | It's good. | Užitečné | Well put together, accurate | Aplikace neustále šikanuje a vyžaduje potvrzení nucenych pseudolegálních špehovacích cookies. Pokud si dám tu práci a odškrtám, že všechny nechci, ještě ten den se vše resetuje a opět obtěžuje. Tento postup je nelegální!! Koukejte to upravit a stáhněte to tak jak to má být! Zaveďte možnost ""Odmítnout vše""!!! Nejsme žádní vaši otroci ke sledování!!! :((((((( | Jednoduché, přehledné a rychlé. Akorát bych přidal možnost uživatelům informovat o spojich (neco na styl ankety; napr. jestli ma spozdeni...). | Discovered a bug - when buying a ticket, selecting the ""Junior 18-25"" age category and enabling the ""certificate of study"" discount to the ticket doesn't actually discount the final price of the ticket | Very good. I like the ability to buy tickets. Information is very accurate. | EDIT: Přečetl jsem, nic se nezměnilo. Co dál? ""Rozhodně vám nedoporučujeme se při příchodu na stanici/zastávku řídit informacemi o zpoždění, protože se mohou tyto informace změnit. Vždy byste se meli řídit časem odjezdu dle jízdního řádu."" ... To vaše posouvání o minutu, když uvádíte zpoždění mě začíná pěkně štvát. Stále včas, včas. Pak tvrdíte, ze je autobus už na zastávce a pak přidáváte minuty. Tahle informace je k ničemu. Buď se na to vykašlete nebo to upravte. Tohle je na nic... | Easy to navigate, find routes and make payments to purchase train tickets. | Useful and accurate info. 👍 | Edit: jak si mohu zakoupit nezobrazování reklam a dotazu, aniž bych nejprve dal souhlas, resp. aniž bych nejprve odklikal tisíce jednotlivých položek? | Velmi užitečná appka | Aj keď si zrušite všetky súhlasy, či ""oprávnené nároky"" v nastaveniach, tak aplikacia ich všetky zresetuje... | Aplikace nyní obsahuje dialog, kde si můžete vybrat zda souhlasíte se sběrem všech vašich informací, nebo souhlasíte se sběrem všech vašich informací s extra kroky. Soukromí se můžete pokusit ochránit manuálním odklikáváním desítek (možná stovek) inviduálních tlačítek ""Legitimate interest"" v schovaném menu. Tohleto hraničí s legálností. Naštěstí již existují alternativy, které nabízí příjemnějši soukromí. | Právě mi to prodalo 2 stejné jízdenky na jeden vlak! Uz jsem objevil chybu. Sice jsem nenastavil 2 osoby, ale program si celkem neprakticky pomatuje, ze jsem naposled kupoval pro 2 osoby a nechal to tam. | Aplikace nově vyžaduje schválení cookies cca stovce různých dodavatelů s ""oprávněným zájmem"", není možné jednoduše odmítnout vše a když už si člověk dá práci s tím všechno odklikat, za pár dní musí dělat to stejné... Velký palec dolů | Od doby co přidali možnost podívat se na zpoždění v předešlých dnech, (což je úplně zbytečná funkce protože s váma vlak milerád vyjebe tím že výjimečně přijede na čas), tak aplikace dost často nezobrazuje kolej na kterou vlak přijede. Jako člověk který pravidelně jezdi jednim nebo dvouma spojema, které jezdi ve stejný čas, jsem používal apku hlavne jen kvuli tomuto. Teď musim jak důchodce čumět na tabuli, protože to nějakej blb nemůže zadat do aplikace. | it's really good for navigating it includes trains buses trams and trolleybuses | Amazing transportation throughout Czechia and accurate bus/tram timings on the app | ""Oprávněný"" zájem nelze vypnout najednou. Po vypnutí se Předvolby dat po čase zase zobrazí. | Excellent traveller's tool. | Tahle aplikace je skvělá, je tam vidět všechno co člověk potřebuje vědět o spojích, ale žádné blbosti navíc. Co mě ale zklamalo je design kupování jízdenek, respektive místenek. Protože když omylem přehlédnete možnost zakoupit místenku která je tam napsaná malým písmenem tak se vás to ani nezeptá jestli si ji nechcete dokoupit. Příště si už musím dát pozor. | Zpoždění autobusů je úplně náhodné, aplikace mi třeba píše zpoždění 8 minut, ale autobus přijede na čas. Zrušené nebo přesměrováné spoje jsou v aplikaci stále vedené beze změny, dnes jsem čekal přes dvacet minut na autobus, jen abych se dozvěděl, že je spoj přesměrován, v aplikaci o tomto přesměrování nebyla jediná informace. Bída a bolest. | Skvělá aplikace, jenom na jízdenky co už neplatí bych ocenil oddělenou sekci od platných. | Free | Very complicated ,make it easy ,so can make sense out of it | Very good app to find bus, train and tram connections. But yet to improve with the train platforms accurately. | I found that application is good 👍 | Simple and powerful ! Very intuitive and responsive, payment with Google pay is a super easy and the function to share to calendar is awesome :) Thank you for this great app | To nové zvětšené písmo je příšerné. Při vší úctě opravdu naprosto příšerné. | Often lacking backwards compatibility, you need to update the app in order to search any connections at all. Doesn't show obvious train connections, you gotta look up the trains yourself and use this app to travel only to the train stop. Every single time I use the app, it asks me for consent, pretty annoying if you're trying to decline most of it. | So you want money fir public transport info ... and you bug me with a language i do not undersrand and you do not have reject all non essenziale coockies... no thankyou. Bulkshit I got a popup if I want to upgrade to a version without adds. | No simple ""Reject All"" button on personal data request and the app keeps re-requesting it periodically after rejection. Response from creator confirms that this hostile design is on purpose and lies about not being able to show ads otherwise, while not commenting on how needlessly complicated it is to withhold consent. | Fungovalo to docela dlouho akorát teď tam nepíšou vlakový spoje třeba tam vynechají celej spoj že v aplikaci není ale na googlu to je. Řekl bych že aplikace bude fungovat stejně ale nefunguje doufám že to opravíte děkuju | Purposedly shows the GDPR consent form repeatedly (at most inconvenient times, of course) if you dont agree to everything. Booo | I've already paid for add-free subscription. And still app pushes the advertisement. | Hello, while it is a good app  For God's sake, how do I change ""my location"" radius? When start stop is on my location there is +-20m and no possibility of change, so this feature is TOTALLY useless when you want to find a stop that isn't really near you. I would expect that changing this would obvious working... Besides this fail, good app. | Always charging automatically for more people than one. I just paid a ticket for 2 instead just for myself. I am done with this app. | Nedaří se mně koupit si nezobrazování reklam. Transakce je vždy zamítnuta Googlem. Pokud se to brzy nevyřeší, koupím si licenci CG Transitu na další rok. | Vracím hvězdičky po opravách chyb ve spojích (chyběla celá jedna linka o svâtcích), které byly, jak se nakonec ukázalo, způsobeny chybou v datech na straně poskytovatele. Škoda jen, že si to nemohou vyříkat společnosti mezi sebou, když na to u jedné z nich upozorním a musím to řešit sám, když chci, aby se to opravilo. | The app works OK, when it works. Especially when phone is switching different data connections (mobile data, wifi hotspots on stations) the app stops working properly, the payment process hangs, and I'm unable to buy a ticket. Several times I had to pay cash with extra fee (because its not possible to buy an e-ticket after train departure time). | Really useful for finding the best connection to get somewhere. Also lets you know live if your bus or tram is running late. | Very Helpful | The best app for public transport in the Czech Republic 😊 Great app. | Not that clear | Convenient, easy and does it's job. | Great app, delay information, train ticket purchase | Exactly just enough of what I need in my day to day commute, ads are not invasive, interface is easy to use, alarms and reminders work as intended, nothing to complain about | Moje nejoblíbenější aplikace na cestování po ČR. Sem tam se mi lokace nechce updatovat, když to nejvíce potřebuji, ale jinak jsem velmi spokojený. | Opravte, jak se zobrazují reklamy. Na každém androidovém telefonu co jsem zatím měl se mi aplikace sekala jako prase jakmile se tam zobrazila nějaká reklama s animací, GIFem apod. A druhá věc, ukázání nejbližší zastávky podle lokace je sice super věc, ale ocenil bych kdyby se počítání času než se na nejbližší zastávku dostanu dal vypnout. Není nikdy přesný a musím si tak vždy načíst dřívější spoje. | the most misleading app of all apps affiliated to Prague's transportation schedule, and Mr. Developer is questioning my understanding, even tho it's his job to fix that misleading application when your firm pays me to do your job, I'll specify issues and apply testing, come with output and work on it. cheers. | its amazing sometimes glitches but i just love i use it everyday. love it | Good | Really usefull for travel across Europe with detailed information of platform, timing, mode of transport, price and many more. One bucket list app for Europe travel | Great when it works. My problem with this app is that it confidently displays wrong information and presents it as correct (which is, at least for me, worse than admitting that it doesn't know). Some examples: 1. The bus/train ""delay times"" show on time, even though the bus/train didn't even leave the first station yet, and will be clearly delayed. 2. The bus departure time is wrong by 5 minutes, but still shows ""on time"" and that the bus is in a completely different station than it really is. | OtBuuy | Appka byla super, ale teď není schopna zapamatovat si mé cookies předvolby a na Android 13 se neaktualizují notifikace s časy odjezdu, takže jsou k ničemu | 14-09-22: Včera instalováno, v nastavení jsou data aktuální, JÍZDNÍ ŘÁDY NEJSOU AKTUÁLNÍ, ukazuje spoje, které podle PID nejedou(jedou jindy), např. dnes, Florenc->Háje IDOS(20:27,30,33,36,39,45), PID(20:30,36,42,48) Podle PID metro skutečně jelo. NEPOUŽITELNÉ | V aplikaci mi chybi nekolik zastavek a spoju v mem meste, kdybych se nekoukl na stranky idos tak vubec nevim, ze nejaky takovy spoj existuje | Veřejná doprava je díky tomuhle strašně lehká. Úžasná appka | Funkčně skvělá aplikace. Jediná věc, která chybí k pěti hvězdám - přestaňte se mě každý týden ptát na souhlas se zpracováním údajů/cookies, protože vám nedávám souhlas. | Прекрасное и удобно приложение для приезжих в страну и незнающих языка это вообще находка. | It's great app I like it it's showing sometimes it's showing wrong hour but again it's a great app. | Užitečné. | Amazing!!! | Kde je tlacitko zdileni? | Everything is really great, except it doesn't show when a train is cancelled. S1 was cancelled yesterday and again today. It is bad luck and I only have to wait 30 minutes, but if I would have known I could have taken a different route. Now I'm 30 minutes waiting on Masarycka. | easy-to-use.I have been using it since I moved to Czech Republic 2011. | Issue remains: can't buy tickets, error | The application is great and easy to use, when it works. Oftentimes I am accused by the application of not having internet access, despite being connected to WiFi or having my mobile data turned on. Sometimes, it resolves itself after a few tries, however most of the time I have to restart my phone in order to fix the issue, which is rather inconvenient, especially when I need to find a connection quickly. | verim ze na dlouho posledni edit: aplikace po dvou dnech zacala zase bez problemu fungovat. diky moc technicke podpore za okamzitou snahu pomoct s problemem | Really helpful app, makes traveling so easy. We could look up the times of trams, buses and trains locally and could plan journeys further afield. | Excellent work at day and with metro and trams. But, specific at night time, don't show buses. Only trams | Použijte pubtran nebo můj vlak, idos nevyhledá všechny spoje. Tohle je aplikace z éry idos monopolu. | Like the ""delayed"" reports. ; ) | To si delate srandu, v roce 2022 to nenajde moji pozici ale zobrazi trasu linky 🙈 | Best app to search for public transport | Fine, practical app, easy to use. Only annoying thing is that when I select one of my previous searches it automatically finds the parameters from before. I don't need to know the schedule for yesterday's tram. I want to use the connection for now or select a new time. Can you fix this please so it just fills the form with the station names for right now and won't search right away so you can set the time as you need it? Thank you | Very good | dobra aplikace je spolehliva a urcite se hodi | Awesome. I don't need to find it on the internet. B it would be better if it showed if it's late, I need to go to google to find out. But great app anyway! | Dávám odinstalovat, jsou jiné a mnohem lepší appky, které mě nenechají na holičkách, když pospíchám a rychle si potřebuji ověřit spojení, na dávání consentu každé 3 vteřiny fakt nemám chuť ani čas. | This app is fantastic and minimalistic: it helps you navigate around the city and does it straightforwardly. | Když neudělím souhlas se zpracováním nepotřebných údajů, začne opakovaně vyskakovat dotaz pomalu při každém druhém hledání a je potřeba odkliknout asi deset položek, které nechci! Otravné!!! Odinstalováno! | Time table is irrelevant. Please sync. | .. edit: 5 stars for quick customer support. | Pokud nechcete svolit personalizované reklamy, musíte ve všech položkách odbouchat, nezájem. A po týdnu nebo 14 dnech znovu a znovu a znovu dokud nepodlehnete. Jinak aplikace funguje jak má, ale tohle je otravný. | No clue why did they remove my review, although whenever I scroll across an ad, the app's refresh rate drops to Less then 1fps. I got pretty high tier mobile device hence I doubt it's a user issue. Would appreciate a feedback. | Excellent and easy to navigate | Čas od času používám a vždy dobře posloužila. | Fantastic! | Couldn't function without it here in CZ | Used to be good, but now wants you to consent with cookies every time you use the app, if you didn't consent to everything the first time. At this point, I think the PID lítačka app is a much better alternative | This app is really useful until it's wrong. There is no way to report a train error. | Funguje jak ma, nikdy zadny problem. Ocenuju i moznost videt jak moc je spoj zpozdeny. | Za cookies... edit: vím k čemu cookies slouží a také myslím, že se od 1.1. změnilo to, jak mi je máte nabízet a jak já s nimu mohu souhlasit/nesouhlasit a nejsem si uplně jist, jestli to je ve vaší aplikaci správně. Strávil jsem minimálně pět minut odmítáním oprávněných zájmu. Kdo mi ten čas vrátí? | Nejde spustit na android 12 Galaxy S10+ | Na Xiaomi 8T aplikace nefunguje. Nejde aplikace spustit. | Just installed it on Galaxy S21 with Android 12 and the application is constantly crashing and not usable at all :( On my old phone with old Android version was working OK... | Was very useful, keeps crashing immediately upon opening, app is unusable in this state. | Don't show nightbus | Good धेरैं राम्राे छ | To automatický nastavování startu a cíle mě neskutečně vytáčí. Předpřipravím si, kam pojedu - za 10 minut jsem u startu a najednou tam mám náhodnej cíl a musím to nastavovat znova, i když jsem aplikaci ani nezavřel. Vývojáři s tím prý nehodlají nic dělat. | Nenajde stanici Husinecká, i když ji sama nabizi Nejlepsi appka na dopravu, hlavnem prazskou MHD, pozna, ze jedete do prace nebo domu a nabidne moznosti, Super, lepsi naz PubTran po reinkarnaci | Very useful | I am OK with advertisement in app but why would I need to accept Consents every 7th time I use search it's beyond me (I have accept the terms...). Lately there seems to be a bug in search where if you search transport from 19:00 it shows one in 19 something and next in 21 something but if you change the start time to 20:00 it will find one that leaves at 20 something. This shouldn't happen. I am highly disappointed as this was pretty good app but it's going only down hill... | It's idiotic I just need to know the schedule, why all this hoopla? | Sometimes the system doesn't find a connection people normally use and rather says there's none or offers some very inconvenient one. With increasing number of delays it becomes harder to read times of departures. Also the developers do not like constructive feedback. Still a pretty good job though. | 1 stars due to constant Consent Management, it doesn't save your preferences and forces you to manually go through a loooong list whilst maliciously coloring the buttons to `Accept Your Choices` and `Accept All`.👎👎👎 Started using a FOSS scraper instead. | Very good | Nejde naráz odmítnout souhlas s reklamou jednoduše. Není zde tlačítko ""odmítnout vše"" zároveň je vše ""opravněný zájem"" a vše je předzaškrtnuto že souhlasím, což je nezákonné a to hned u několika stovek reklamních systémů. Takže hnus. K odpovědi: Ano, ty zákony znám, reklamní systémy nepatří do oprávněného zájmu. Aplikaci hold mažu a jdu používat PubTran, co vypadá, že nešpehuje a nepřeposílá data co nemá. | Does the job, worth the paid version with no adds. | některé zastávky lze dohledat pouze přes mapu nikoliv přes vyhledávání :( | Proč si nemůžu stáhnout tu samou PDF jízdenku co mi přijde na e-mail. Proč ten QR kód co se zobrazí v aplikaci po chvíli zmizí. | Not gonna give you the rights! Disgusting and uninstall | Cookies a reklamy | Google pay service is ""temporarily"" unavailable since june, using app is useless right now. Edit: it was fault of my browser, not the app. | hruza!!naco vubec provozujete aplikaci ktera lze o stavu spoje? spoj ktery ani nedorazil do vychozi stanice a ma zpozdeni 20min, hlasite ze je na trase! konkretne R887!.... odpoved; k cemu ta app teda je?hodnota dat 0 v porovnani s papirovym jizdnim radem a tohle v main features je tedy proc: • Online search = always actual data including delays and disruptions?????? odpoved: od kdy jsou v jizdnim radu zpozdeni? | Nepoužitelné. Schválně lže o časech vlaků. | Ty vaše otravné reklamy totálně zasekávají telefon a vyhledávání spojů. Když nejsou na obrazovce, vše v poho. | Totally useful. Great app, thanks to it i was able to find connections and buy all the bus and tain tickets during my travels. | The application has stopped working. It does not show connectionc, but those that show are complete nonsense!

Have you ever in heard in og in an s24;ultra +;running android 5 it only gets worse from there. | Very good | Good app! | excellent service | AliExpress very bad customer service. I purchased items they agreed free return, after purchasing item free return, 45 days waiting still return package not Done . Don't waste time AliExpress. | excellent | My order was delivered in time, though the material was not exactly the quality that I expected | Very easy user friendly and fast | Very very good | Love this app best shopping app their is. | Enjoying shopping with AliExpress. I'm a new customer so I've just started shopping and finding awesome stuff 😁 | The main problem of this company is price changing for example if the price of item is 0.54$ when you put card details and press pay than price will be change and you'll be charged 7$ or around .. I'm faced this issue.. and the 2nd problem they'll never let to use coupon fairly..if they remove these 2bugs than this company or app will be on the top ..I hope AliExpress will take step on these 2 issues.Thanx | Fabulous app Definitely should download if u love awesome stuff!!! | My order arrived within 5days and was packed very well thankyou. I will definitely order more products | im happy aliexpress is improving | This time please no any order in ksa. No delivery this time please 🙏 | I have been ordering from other online services, and AilExpress is the best I have come across. | The reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the new update for wishlist, I feel like it's made it harder to find an item, you can no longer filter it or anything. | Reliable | Terrible platform. No insurance on lost parcels, the customer support is dumb. Sellers send empty packages and no refund is received... | Service is getting much better | I can almost find anything | Apps is working very slow.              Please fix it. | Best app for online purchases Well come deal with Free shipping | Greet | Good | Good job. | 🔥💯💚 | It looks like a good app I love shipping on line. | Search is useless, it keeps showing me only the results that cannot be shipped to my country. I'm struggling to find anything that can be | Very good app for shopping 🛍️ | Great Experience | They are there to help if you are having problems. Only flaw is Its hard to get customer service on the line. | Almost everything has came that I've ordered. | Very good app | Verry good app | Overall they are pretty good little company and you got to admit you get what you pay for I mean some of the stuff that I order I'm disappointed with and there are things that I ordered that I really love their customer service is great | Awesome so far love the items and prices keep up the great work | Very helpful and refund are easy .....recommending to use it | Very nice app | Fraud. Will take your money and then ask you to do so many hassles just to file a refund claim. The ""trusted"" people fake things and deny the most legit cases on their assumptions | find almost all I need some good some not so but overall good | Loved it | Wow wow fantastic | I've made 2 purchases through this horrible app it has been 25 days, since purchase nothing has been shipped, I have contacted aliexpress to get my money back they told me the items I purchased are out of stock, now I'm struggling with their dumb automated system to get my money back. I highly recommend skipping this app it will just be a time waster because you will never receive your product. | Love this app,so many things that are cool | The shop is lying its not GLOBAL what you think, it's INIDIAN_GLOBAL so there is no B20, the wifi 5ghz not connecting, the rom is laggy like hell! The official bootloader unblock is not working on miui 12 anymore only with 13, with vpn, the phone has 12 miui.... EDL is working with test point, I tried to unlock the BL, ""there are some"" preunlocked img on the net, without luck! Shop is lying dont buy this phone from here! LAST TIME FROM ORDER SOMETHING FROM ALI, ali account deleted | The seller sent item not per product on picture but cannot be returned and refunded. | I have used the app several times and it works very well. | Verry useful | The app slows down my phone. I had lagging issues that I traced to this app. I force it to stop, lagging would vanish but now the latest version will restart itself after a few minutes so the lagging returns quickly. On top of this irritating behavior, it's poorly organized and is missing features like the web page contains, like easy access to coupons or tracking vendor disputes. | Good platform | If u dont mind waiting a few weeks for stuff great app | Ont good | Good experience | Goood | 👍 | satisfied | Would rate highest if when I select only notifications on my orders, I didn't receive promotion adverts. It's annoying. | Some items aren't available in shops | Good | It's pretty much intuitive and easy to use. For people that have a shopaholic problem the amount of promotions and such is overwhelming. Be responsible. | I received my product in very quick time and what I ordered thanks to Ali Express for their excellent service | The app is easy to navigate. Got my order very very quick. | Nice app .easy to use .good production | This good shopping app | I like aliexpress | Fast easy effective | Did the job by helping me buying what I needed and tracking my product fast | Nothing but good to say. No negative experiences. | So good | Good | Good | Works well and easy to use. | Nice app | Very happy with the product or the items that I have gotten. The shipping takes a little while but for what you're paying for it I'm very happy. I will continue buying my items from them thank you guys so much | It is the absolute worst now! Save for the fact that my card suddenly stopped being accepted for no reason, the prices are charting and what tf is CHOICE???? WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHOICE WITH THAT NONSENSE. You claim to be free shipping but then we see it's with conditions. What's the point? Immediately I find another store, I'm jumping off. Aliexpress is trash now. | Shopping has become expensive and there is no free delivery | Helped me searching required electriconic board and purchase. | Runs good for me | Good site but watch the postage prices lots to choose from | I spent probably two and a half hours going through each item reading the small print the sizes the reviews making sure there was no fees no shipping and handling Etc and upon checking out I went through each item and check the little circles so I could pay and each time I selected a circle the price changed it would be $0.49 then all of a sudden it's $11 and then it's a 99 cent and then it goes to 8 dollars Etc and then items that I selected that said there was no shipping and handling had fees | موثوق جيد ولكن محرك البحث يحتاج إلى المزيد من التطوير والدقة والخيارات. شكرا لجهودكم. | It's ok | Good App. Makes the shopping easy. | Keep moving forward and good luck | The app is the bset with many good items with cheap prices | Everything so far I have order came very good and good on shipping I have ordered over 30 things on here and so far just one I would return overall happy customer 😊 | Good👍 | Very easy and fast | Good | Love it | Good Experience | It is easy to use | Good. | Everything is good quality | Very cheap | i wish that AliExpress can make a solution for quick refund requests which 1 could be establishing their own wallet so that customers who just mistakenly placed an order can simply get their money back right after cancelling it, and that be able to use the fund from the wallet in placing another order online since not all your customers have this unlimited funds on their accounts. hopefully your team would consider this concern, I'm sure it will be much more convenient 5 star rated online | Good app | It is very convenient delivery is very fast service is very fast I am very happy with the service | Used to be a great app. Now it's a disappointment. Searches don't work. Filters for search results don't work. Sorting by price don't work. This became a garbage app. | Really bad customer service. They use phrases like 'your family' and 'go the extra mile'. However they're lazy and don't do anything | I have to watch unskippable popups before I can use the app. Uninstalled. | No issues so far. My experience all food as far | ❤️ | Worst shopping app ever coupons not working they force you to buy with high price or they ban your account | App was easy to use! Product was as advertised and arrived quicker than expected. Will use app again! | Very satisfied, original products sent. | Easy to use Great deals The more you buy at once faster the shipping | They provide very good service | Why can't shipping to Indonesia? | I'm never trust ali express | Good and reliable services. | Everything was as described and cheap! | useful app for every one best for online shoping .👍👍 | Best | It’s really good | Good app store | Very very satisfied. Every time when I receive something, I get surprised because of the quality of the product. | Dope merch | Good gear generally | Great | Mi gusta es la qente | Wish I had my package | Please don't buy expensive things from this app .i hv bought a smartphone but it doesn't have basic functions of a smartphone.as it is a fake one.only 1 out of 4 cameras is working but its very poor quality eith blured photos.othes are damage and have some fake lenses embedded to the phone.cant even use Google app.i request To return and refund.even after receiving the massage to refund i cant contact the seller or AliExpress to get the address of seller neither they are responding to my emails. | I'm considering to close my account. They're still rising the shipping prices at ridiculous amounts. The problem is they charge fees for each item apart, not for a whole purchase. | Good luck 💯 | Good better best | Good but sometimes the tracking its not accurate | It is good | The order received on time and informed through local agent via mobile phone | Nice apps | Trust Service | It's really nice to use and I have ordered tons of stuff. Really convenient and easy. The only problem is to get hold of Aliexpress management themselves as I have a suggestion but I don't seem to get hold of them. | The items have improved in quality a lot! Shipping and packaging as well, way better than other places! Being an occasional online buyer, I usually find things here that I can't find anywhere else, and at MSRP prices since it doesn't have insane resellers, they give the best deals ❤️💯 | So many freaking ads and popups, I'm deleting this, As I installed | Very nice experience | I'm happy with everything I've gotten | Was skeptical at first but everything has shipped fast and worked properly so far | The application is user friendly. Some of the delivery takes too long. | Very nice | The app used to work brilliantly, but with the latest updates functionality has changed and not for the better. The default wish list has gone missing, so if there are items there you can't get to them. If you want to delete an item you used to be able to go the list that contained the item and delete it there, this is no longer the case, you have to go to the all items list and delete it there if you can find it. If you want to add new items the system won't let you. | Avoid, they don't help with returns | Great people to work with | Sad.. shipping to Indonesia is gone now.. | Read reviews before buying from certain sellers. Other than that, a pleasant experience to shop, generally with guaranteed delivery times.","{""1"":801765,""2"":249722,""3"":497075,""4"":1970058,""5"":11363787}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Alibaba Mobile","Alibaba+Mobile","developer.android@aliexpress.com","https://aliexpress.com","10 Collyer Quay

Coin collection is a nice feature. Search customizations are not adequate and too many things to click on. Sometimes not enough spec on the product while they are available on other platforms. The app should be streamlined in a better way. One thing I hated the most is the ad or notification that pop up when you open the app. Over all, would you use it again and continue purchasing from Ali Express."",""If you order anything, the \""tracking\"" functionality is essentially useless. In some cases, the app provides inconsistent information, e.g., the line graph shows it has not yet reached customs, while the text indicates it has departed customs. Forget about reaching out for help. The chat feature is automated and is similarly useless as it does not seem to consider user input when providing its reply. This is based on my first order of several items, and there is no good news yet."",""1. It's hard sorting items by price, including delivery. The delivery price can be x2 than the item price, but the sorting feature doesn't care. 2. The picture of the item and the price don't match when I search. When I click there, it can be just a box of the item for this price. 3. When I start the application,I see advertisements for several seconds. that's terrible 4. Free delivery tick doest work well, it shows \""free from xxx dollars\"", I don't want spent more, why you show it's free then?"",""I recently purchased 11 items and 3 of them never arrived and I had trouble getting the refund. The refund process is complicated, confusing and takes too long. Amazon maybe more expensive but at least it doesn't take 4 weeks for delivery and I can track the purchase all the way to my door. It's also alot easier to do refund/returns w Amazon. 3 out of 11 items not showing up is too high of a failure rate for me."",""Used to be great, now the search function is completely useless - I remember when I first started buying from Aliexpress, the search function was so in-depth, you could even filter out words you didn't want to show up, but it seems like every year they've taken away more functionality until it's become impossible to actually find a specific thing you want, and this is a problem on both the browser and app versions. The one thing the app has over browser version is the wishlist works.""]",false,false,false,"com.alibaba.aliexpresshd","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alibaba.aliexpresshd&hl=en&gl=CZ"

But the level of ignoring customers DMs, seems unbelievable. | My food is always missing. | nearly free beer on wolt market every week | A lot of issues with the deliveries, deliveries constantly get delayed, sometimes even for over an hour, or missing parts of the order, never once do I get a compensation. Customer service is non responsive. The delivery people always want me to get out of the house and meet them iout in the street (I live in the ground floor).

On asking the costumer support, they said i have been blocked automatically by our server because they thought or felt i have multiple accounts 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️... I don't think anyone can make multiple accounts on wolt. So my first experience is quite bad.. I suggest use glovo instead or bolt food...

I saw a driver walking to my house with two bottles of drinks as ordered but when i met him he gave me only 1, i tried raising awareness but i guess giving credits and telling the costumer to shut up is easier than actually dealing with the problem.

Defenitally 5 star from me | When I saw that the dish it the restaurant cost almost 50% less than in Wolt my mind was blown up (22 lari in the restaurant and 40 lari in Wolt!!!). I've never seen such an crazy hidden fee (I thought that it was the actual restaurant price). Unbelievable!!! | Bad bad bad. Was a customer for the longest time but with the recent drop in quality of service and the totally useless customer support I've decided to delete my account and never use this garbage app again. | חייבים להרגע עם הפרסומות popup תוך כדי שימוש באפליקציה, אם פתחתי את האפליקציה אני כנראה הולך להזמין... לא צריך פרסומת כל 15 שניות | Wolt Delivery has been such a good convenience. I appreciate having this delivery service here in Tbilisi. | Prices are sky high. Smaller portions and higher prices than in a restaurant. In addition to that you pay delivery fee and service fee. Then you get cold food which looks nothing like in the pictures. False advertising. | Pregledno in funkcionalno. Trudijo se izboljšat uporabnikovo izkušnjo.

Basically a way to pay more and get less. | I like it | No delivery in my town. | Offers ""free delivery"" but the sign up process doesn't actually work so you can't order. Nice scam 👎 | I didn't even download the app but it's 🗑️ trash 🗑️ | שירות שליחים מזעזע, ושירות לקוחות עוד יותר גרוע. אכזבה, אומר לכם את זה בתור לקוח קבוע | Auto translation setting is broken, doesn't work and can't click on it in setting | Customer services are awful, I was a plus member with them and spent thousands on wolt, using them daily. I ordered one meal that was stone cold, not even slightly warm I complained to customer services and was basically told I was lying, with no support or refund offered in anyway Bare in mind I placed hundreds of orders with Wolt, very rarely complained, the response and attitude from wolf was simply disgusting I will never use them again and I hope others see this before ordering | Perfect | Good service you can find what you need | Great first time experience. Easy to use and on time. | To put it shortly: horrible experinece. The support did not help me even a bit. Food came very cold previous 5 times I ordered, tried to give them a chance a lot but there was no point they could not right their wrongs. As long as they fit in their given estimate time wich shouldn't even be an estimate (in my opinion if you don't know the delivery time dont give them 10/15 minute difference estimates) they do this to get of the hook when you are not satisfied with the only job they have to do | I ordered a delivery. Courier called and ask to pick up order outside (well no problem). After that I was waiting for 30 minutes calling him 12 times trying to explain where I am including sending him location. He kept on saying 2 minutes... Eventually I had to apply the support. Surprisingly, they said to me that the order was damaged and they refund me the amount within 14 days. I sent the screenshots of about 12 calls but they disregarded this. Terrible! | Professionalism, great support team, and user-friendly application. | 2η φορα που κάνω παραγγελία και περιμενω και δεν την πήρε ποτε και εβγαλε ""βαλτε διεύθυνση"" ενω ειχα μπει κανονικα. | Wolt delivery is very quick. | It's the first time i used Wolt and i love it so much | Har inte beställt så många gånger men det är snabbt enkelt och i tid, inte sällan i god tid! Riktigt bra utbud! | Aplikaciju vec dva mjeseca steka pracenje kurira. Zadnji put je dostavljac jadan cekao 10min pred adreso. Jer je meni pokazivalo da nije niti pokupio narudzbu. | Please add the ability to comment on any item (a dish) in an order from restaurants. I have allergies and this feature will help me buy more dishes without certain ingredients. | Drivers dont read instructions and leave the food at the doorstep of the building on the street.. and customer service is not responsive, send generic messages and don't provide any assistance. I paid for an order that was never delivered. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. | Great app easy to use | Don't use this app. If someone gives you the wrong order, the customer service will not give you your money back. They will scam you. Try something else. Absolute scammers and criminals. Hopefully they will go bankrupt. Let's hoep so. Lots of better apps than this one. | Too often lately I'm getting the notorious ""restaurant is busier than we thought"" message from this otherwise excellent app | Wolt is the most rediculous low quality service company I know. | Amazing app very easy to use | Wolt simply the best! | Ostatnie zamówienia bardzo mnie zawiodły. Jedzenie przychodziło po długim czasie oczekiwania zimne i często zalane przez napój, który się wylał. Ostatnim razem kurier nie mógł znaleźć klatki (stojąc przed nią), pokręcił się wokół bloku, zaznaczył, że zamówienie dostarczone i odjechał, a tym razem stał pod blokiem i w końcu wyszłam przed blok i sama musiałam go znaleźć. Zaznaczę, że dostawcy innych aplikacji nigdy nie mieli takiego problemu. | By far the best | Odlično 👌 | Sorry - very disappointed in how the orders are handled. You got a promise on that an order will be delivered in 15 minutes and then it takes for over 2 hours when the promise of 15 gets extended over an over. It seems Wolt is not a vendor you can trust. If you want to have a meal in time just trust your order with alternatives... | Super Buggy app! Had issues right from signup to placing order. The customer support is not any helpful either. Certainly a big 'No' unless you wanna waste your time | I can't login with my accurate credentials, prefer to use other apps then this buggy piece of 💩 | Food | Худший сервис и для заказов, и для работы. Никогда не отвечают, вовремя не привозят, денег не возвращают. Зовут на работу и полгода рассматривают договор. В общем - 0 баллов из 10, нет, даже -10 | To be honest, very good service and they give you 10€ discount for first time . The best in the island and it's the truth. Stay strong | Əla | ❣️❣️❣️ | Great service! Glovo is a pice of crp! | Order many times. Orders are delayed. Restaurant cutting on food quantities because of fee they have to pay to wolt. Paid 4k huf for a slice of bread. Upon contacting the support, we get a message that we try to improve next time. But we all know the next time never comes !! Not gona use it anymore!! Better to use other alternatives! | Good.. | Please tell your couriers to bring change when delivering our orders please even when I type exactly how much I have they still have nothing | Always delay the delivery and do not refund you. Be aware! Scammy! | Very good service | Great service | They charge the service fee for goods which I returned because the store sent the wrong product . Which means I paid for the mistake of the store. | Should be an option to split payment in order together | Used to be good, now you get your delivery X 3 of the originally presented time | Nice | Az elmúlt 1 hónapban szinte mindig dupla idő alatt szállítanak, mint a becslés, néha még ennél is tovább tart. A support pedig mindig ugyanazt a sablon üzenetet küldi 🥲 | Eddig bármilyen szolgáltatót használtam, ha az ingyenes próbaidőszakot lemondtam, akkor a promóció idejéig használhattam az extra szolgáltatásokat. Még volt 2 hetem az egy hónapos Wolt+ próbaidőszakból, de amikor lemondtam oda is lett. Sehol máshol nem tapasztaltam még ilyet, le is töröltem egyből az appot. Ennél azért több engedmény járna szerintem. | Food arrives late despite high delivery prices. It says up to 60 minutes but food arrive after 86 minutes. The dishes in delivery have poor quantity of food and is cold. Customer service not compensating for delivery nor food. App is deleted. | Vrlo bezobrazno, postavljen limit da je potreban narudžba iznad 12 eura ili Vam cijenu podignu na 12 eura bez obzira naručite li ispod te cijene. Katastrofa. | Good experience. If there are any issues they are swiftly resolved. 99.99% of the time there are no issues. Couriers on this app seem more professional than om competitors apps. | Delivery time is excellent. | Δεύτερη φορά μου κάνετε μαλακια.2η φορά είναι ότι απόψε έκανα παραγγελία και σας το τόνισα δύο φορές να κρατάτε το pos και το προσωπικό σας με παίρνει τηλέφωνο αφού έχει περάσει η μισή ώρα ότι δε διαθέτετε Pos .τι φάση πραγματικά?Το παιδί δε φταίει σε τπτ.@@@@@@@ | Great service | This is a great application for ordering food. And i'm very satisfied with how easy it is to use | Sose jó az érkezési számláló, az embert hülyének nézik ezzel, még a support is a késéseknek a reklamációját mellőzi és próbálja szép köntösbe öltöztetni, hogy nem is úgy van | estimated time. will order again through wolt. | You should add penalties for drivers that break the law and puts us all in danger and specifically one way | They have a vey good services and offers which is affecting very well on the customers satisfaction. 😊💙 | Najbrzi! | its feels like they realy wants me to enjoy my orders & their service, with my little experienc if you want to get what u paid for - only wolt!!! | Fljótlegt og þægilegt fyrir staði sem aha er eru ekki með eins og til dæmis KFC og Taco Bell, ég prufaði Wolt einu sinni í Danmörku og var bara núna að prufa það hérna heima og ég get sagt ég eindregið mæli með Wolt, ég mæli með að tippa sendlunum eitthvað smá fyrir að vera kurteis og faglegir með sendinguna þína, þeir eru frekar snöggir með sendinguna líka 🙂. | Always here when needed... | Works well, I am satisfied. | Horrible service | Amazing Good | Donesi je bio zakon. | Bad chat support, delivery time estimate, and service quality. | Ძაან კაია გენაცვალეეე😘❤ | Sovellus on erinomainen ja toimii hyvin | Good service, amazing timing 😄 | Сделайте бота как у BOLT, чтобы очевидные проблемы решались быстрее и автоматически | Wolt gave me the worst experience yesterday. I waited 90 minutes for food to hear from the delivery boy that he's cancelling my order, he will not be coming. Please, close your business or hire someone who knows how to use google maps. I still can not believe it. I hope my 15 euros will make you richer and grow your business. | 90% of the time the food either arrives cold, or something is missing. Most restaurants don't really care about the food quality either, because they know Wolt will compensate the client. | everything was good thanks 👍 | Exceptional thanks | Always great service | Supr. 🔥🔥🔥 | Perfection | Very nice delivery options in Georgia | Brzo jednostavno, full! | Ļoti ērti 😉🤙 | კარგია | Quick and efficient service. Plenty of choice | Great for ordering from a wide variety of restaurants | They really don't care about keeping loyal clients. I was paying for wolt Plus, and they had a promotion for 5 months free. I went to the customer service asking or they would give to me and they said no, it was just for new customers 🤡 I am a sole mother of two autistic kids recently divorced and trying my best to save money. And I used wolt to buy things from wolt market. So I just deleted the account, and now I buy from Bolt instead. No consideration for loyal customers. You lost me. | Waited 2 hours for delivery but order wasn't even sent to restaurant. Horrible. | Κάποτε, είχε τρομερό service και τρομερή υποστήριξη. Τώρα κάθε παραγγελία είναι και μια απογοήτευση. Καθυστερήσεις στις παραδόσεις, δεν βρίσκεις κάποιον εύκολα στο support και όταν γίνεται λάθος ούτε έκπτωση, ούτε κουπόνι. Δεν βρίσκω κάποιο λόγο να το χρησιμοποιώ πλέον. | Impossible to register. I never used the app. Tried 2 different emails. Magic link is just a link to open a new account which ends with ""error"" message | The best | One hour of waiting for courier to be assigned for the order, when the dish is already ready! This is the ""service"" Wolt provides in Hungary!! I am constantly complaining on that during two last years. And, of course, they are doing nothing with that! | Customer service time is appalling and the chat AI is ridiculously bad.

"Mobilní klíč eGovernmentu","The eGovernment Mobile Key application for the Android mobile platform, issued by the Ministry of the Interior, enables easy and fast login to Data Boxes and a number of other public administration web applications without the need to enter a complex name and password.
To use in data boxes, install the Mobile Key application on your mobile phone or tablet and connect it to your user account in Data Boxes (Settings - Login Options - Mobile Key Login). To log in to the Data Boxes, all you have to do is log in to the Mobile Key with your fingerprint (or PIN, password or image password - of your choice) and download the QR code on the login page.
 You can connect one Mobile Key to multiple data boxes. After logging in with the Mobile Key, the Data Boxes will then offer you a selection of all available user accounts.
 Notifications of new messages in your data mailbox may also be delivered to the Mobile Key.
 There are several options for logging in via the National Point. After installing the application on your mobile phone, you can either transfer your identity from the data box to the National Point or pair the Mobile Key application with your existing National Point account using another electronic means of login or you can contact the public administration contact point ( Czech POINT) to open a new account in the National Point.
The mobile key requires Android version 4.4 or higher to run and the screen lock on (it must not be possible to unlock the device by simply sliding the screen, the unlock pattern, PIN or password must be set).
If your device has a fingerprint reader and Android at least 6.0, you can sign in to your Mobile Key with your fingerprint.
To log in to Data Mailboxes, you need to have an internet or tablet access to the Internet - it doesn't matter if it's via mobile data or Wi-Fi.
 The Mobile Key application only provides secure login without the need to enter login details. The access to the data box itself (reading messages) continues in the web browser - the application does not provide anything other than login (and delivery of notifications).

Třeba banka automaticky vypne autentifikaci otisky, dokud se nepřihlásím heslem, tady nic.

Něco hodně nepěkného mu řeknu. | I will not give root access to my phone to some kinda programmer who couldn't even set up google/apple or facebook auth | Moc si preju, abych tuto zbytecnou a spatne naprogramovanou aplikaci co nejdrive nepotreboval a mohl ji definitivne smazat! | Aplikace pořád padá... | Chtel jsem eidentitu, zavedlo me to az sem dobry, ale posledni nabidka 5 ti moznosti me naprosto zmatla - kde je ta eidentita? | App is looks like it was made by middle schoole student, it's ridiculous that this is app made by government. | Dobry pro prihlasovani pomoci otisku prstu. Ale pokud se Vam zplasi telefon a nepovede se vam naskenovat otisk, tak se appka zamke na 5min. Clovek se ok tak pockam 5min a zkusim to znova jeste ta apka furt ten limit samovolne podruluze, spustite a rekne zkus to zase za dalsich 5min aniz by doslo k dalsimu pokusu. Takze jako co delat? Nevim proc v tomto pripade neprijde na radu 2 factor authrozice do appky, clovek chce neco vyresit podepsat a ne cekat nez se appka smiluje a da mu moznost zkusit se znova prihlasit! | Pokud má někdo problémy s rootnutým telefonem pomocí Magisku doporučuji použít vestavěnou funkci MagiskHide. | Can't be used if you not allow display reading by app. | Prostě boží :) Do Portálu občana se přihlásím otiskem a vyfocením QR. Na mobilu je integrace ještě jednodušší. Není co vytknout. | Warning about a possible hack when installing.The app can read what is on the display. | Jako aplikace ministerstva v roce 2021 je to opravdu zklamání. Hodně věcí dokonce nefunguje vůbec. | Funguje dobře zatím se vším, co umožňuje přihlášení pres eidentitu, spokojenost. | Nefunguje na telefonu který vlastním já a nikoliv Čínská Lidová Republika. Root je problém, ale aktualizace od Huawei jsou v pořádku. Od kdy je státu co do toho, jak zabezpečuji své zařízení? Příště mi bude kontrolovat jestli mám doma na rodný list trezor? | WTF. Mam na androidu pouze odemceny bootloader a kvuli tomu mi nejde aplikace spustit. Pry bezpecnostni hazard, lol. Hlavne ze banky apod. jsou s tim v pohode, to se zase někdo angažoval 🤦 | nesrozumitelné právnicky překomplikované vyjadřování | No English | Ad překrytí i čtení obrazovky: pokud je to vědomá volba uživatele, je vám po tom pendrek. informujte, ale nevynucujte. Edit: helejďte se, vaše slavná appka se mi prostě ani nespustí, telefon používám zcela standardně, nevím, jestli vám vadí password manager, nebo Messanger, a je mi to vlastně jedno.. Nová appka mojeID klíč od Wultry fachá na první dobrou. Klidně se držte vašeho názoru ""není to úplně optimální"", ale v praxi ZABÍJÍTE český eGov. | Není možné použít pro přihlášení na stejném zařízení (přihlásit se v mobilním prohlížeči). | Works ok but the issue I have with the whole rollout of the czech version of egov portal. It is a convoluted process with poor explanation and guide for someone who already uses the key for data mailbox and now adding eidentita.cz. Why is can't those folks hire competent people who understand users needs. You never get average Czech use it let alone embrace it in the current form. | Odpad. Marne cekani na notifikaci po pridani mobilnihi klice do Datovky. | Aplikaci nelze používat, přestože nemám root. K ničemu | Don't use this application my friendly recommend | Za mě splňuje účel! Sem tam padá nebo trvá, než se zobrazí oznámení, ale jinak ok. | Nemůžu dostat SMS | Nelze pouzivat bez zamku displeje? Vy mne budete diktovat, jak si mam zabezpecit svoje data? Achjo. To tak nekoho zastavi, ze musi odkoukat jednomistne heslo malovane pres cely displej. Nase statni sprava stale intelektualne v dobe kamenne, ale byrokratickou buzeraci drzet krok s pokrokem, to jo. | Nefunguje z důvodu jiné aplikace ""překrývající"" klíč, i když jsem to schválil na předešlé obrazovce. | Nefunguje na telefonu s LineageOS, protože mám root práva, což je bizarní. Zajímalo by mě proč jsem trestán za to, že mám na rozdíl od Google oveček, nadvládu nad svým telefonem. | Je to na nic. | app is only in Czech, no possibility to translate or change to another language | Není možné opsat kód, protože při přepnutí aplikace se aplikace ukončí. | Byly doby, kdy fungovala celkem normálně, ale teď věčně nefunguje. Nejdříve problémy s tím, že údajně nemám nastavený zámek otiskem prstu a teď po startu zamrzne na bílé obrazovce. Vymazat app data pomůže vždy jen na několik dní a obnáší to znovu projít celý proces autorizace zařízení v datové schránce. Hrozná ostuda u takovéto důležité aplikace. Edit: teď mám navíc stále problém s tím, že mám aplikaci zablokovanou z důvodu zadání špatného hesla (měsíc jsem aplikaci nepoužíval) | Zatim vse funguje jak ma Spokojenost. | App is not working if i dont have lock on my phone no thans i dont want pin its my decision to not do it and you dont need to care about it | Doesn't work on secure Android images | Když funguje, tak dobrá. Ale, jednou jsem měl špinavou čtečku otisků a po pár pokusech se aplikace na pár minut zablokovala. Což je pochopitelné. Problém je, že už se nikdy znovu nerozběhla - po spuštění píše, že je zablokována do náhodného času (minulého či budoucího) a nelze s tím nic udělat. | Zbytečně komplikované řešení. Inu státní systém. :( | všechny národní služby vypadají jak kdyby je programovalo malý dítě, všechno naprosto nepřehledný a složitý, včetně téhle aplikace. tohle má být digitální Česko..?!!! | Dobrý den, narazil jsem na problém s aplikací v Android 10 (Nokia 7 plus) - systém mi při každém spuštění aplikace napíše, že aplikace se se pokouší číst data z displeje telefonu (asi místo fotoaparátu). Zároveň probíhá odpočet 20 sekund, během kterých není možné aplikaci použít (bezpečnostní feature). Než při každém přihlašování čekat 20 sekund, budu raději používat standardní přihlašování pomocí hesla, dokud tato chyba nebude opravena. Update 10. 12. 2020: po updatu stále bliká screen. Shame | Posledni update aplikaci komoletne. Po spusteni nekolik sekund blika obrazovka a pak aplikace skonci. Ostuda! | Nefunkční. Po spuštění jen prázdná bílá obrazovka. | po instalaci nove verze a pokusu o obnoveni klicu pro Datove schranky nejde obnovit. Chyba: Nepodarila se komunikace se serverem Datovych schranek. Obnoveni ze zalohy se nezdarilo. Zkuste prosim pozdeji. Uz to zkousim 2. den a stale stejna chyba. | Funguje dobre. Akorat pri listopadovem updatu se zmenou nazvu aplikace jsem musel app smazat, znovu nainstalovat a znovu nastavit, ale pokud k tomu nebude dochazet kazdych par mesicu, pak je to ok. | Po update aplikace na mobilni klic ""eGovernmentu"" byl pristup resetovan a aplikace pozaduje zadat novy pin nebo heslo. Timto jsem ztratil kompletne pristup k datove schrance. Prihlaseni jmenem a heslem jiz nadale neni funkcni. | chyba opravena, appka již funguje jako předtím. | Chyba vypadá to že nemáte nastavený zámek obrazovky. Hmm vypadá to, že jste to špatně naprogramovali Díky. Ještě zkuste trošku poupravit ten design ať to nevypadá jako z roku 2010 | Aplikace po updatu při pokusu o otevření zasekne ve smyčce načítání a nejde ukončit. Pomůže akorát restart telefonu. EDIT: chyba opravena, aplikace dělá přesně, co má | Zatím mi appka vždy fungovala tak, jak jsem potřeboval. Otevřu, přihlásím se kam potřebuji a zavřu. Víc od appky nepotřebuji a přesně tohle appka dělá. | Have you guys ever heard of Google Password Manager? You don't really need to type the username and password again each time you want to login. Considering you say this app is an improvement to login process, you are truly wrong. Maybe it could at least show the received messages, but wait, it does not! | Myslím že negativní recenze jsou přehnané, funguje to velmi dobře. | Neužitečné. Nešetří čas ani nezvyšuje zabezpečení. Google nebo Microsoft Authenticator App by byl lepší. | Nenabizi se mi moznost prihlasovani otiskem prstu, přestože na mem telefonu v jinych aplikacich funguje. Telefon nemam v rezimu root. Update 10.4.2020: Problem pretrvava. Podle popisu aplikace by ctecka otisku prstu mela fungovat od Androidu 6.0. Mam verzi 8.0 a moznost otisku prstu ve vasi aplikaci nevidim | Klíč byl úspěšný přidány ale pokaždé chce načíst QR code?! | Aplikace stále padá android 10 OnePlus 7. | Fakt nechápu, k čemu tahle aplikace je. Je určena k tomu, abych pořád dokola zadával QR kód? Tak by to mělo být v popisu. Já se chci na otisk prstu dostat do datové schránky!!! Nemohl by se nad celým konceptem datové schránky zamyslet někdo inteligentní a udělat jednu intuitivní aplikaci, která tuto funkcionalitu umožní? Nechci zadávat dokola QR kódy, piny ani nic dalšího. Chci si otevřít aplikaci Datová schránka, přiložit prst a prolistovat si, co mám v datové schránce. Dává to smysl? | Yay! | ""Aplikace je překryta jinou aplikací""... Pořád a stále dokola... A ne, nemám krom této aplikace nic jiného otevřeného | Po měsíci jsem znovu zkusil spárovat a stále se opakující smyčka... Tentokrát už hodnotím, protože neschopnost během měsíce reagovat na nemožnost aplikaci použít je neuvěřitelně | Pracuje, jak má (jak je popsáno v návodu). Umožňuje bezpečnější a jednoduché přihlášení k datové schránce a přitom zachovává (pokud si to sami nezakážete) i možnost přihlásit se jako dříve jenom jménem a heslem (o čemž vám vždy přijde notifikace na mobil s tímto klíčem, což je super bezpečnostní vychytávka). Umí i různé notifikace, je to fajn věc. | Není možné nastavit heslo pro přístup k aplikaci. Aplikace vyžaduje zámek obrazovky, který z jistých důvodů nepoužívám a používat nebudu. | Postupoval jsem podle návodu až k bodu ""Připojení Mobilního klíče k účtu je tím dokončeno a následuje ještě nastavení dalších možností:"".  Nyní když v mobilu spustím aplikaci, tak se objeví výzva ""Nasnímejte QR kód"". Ale to už jsem udělal !!! !!! | nefunguje pro vice DS | Při přechodu na pozadí aplikace pokaždé spadne. Po aktivaci a přihlášení se mi pořád zobrazuje obrazovka se skenovaním qr kódu. Nejsem schopen určit zda aplikace funguje, bojím se to používat, prosím vás o brzkou nápravu. | Jak uz psali i jini, po kazdem zapnuti a zadani pinu chce aplikace zase naskenovat QR kod, a tato smycka se porad opakuje. Co s tim? Apka by se hodila! | Ne funkcias kun radika atingo. Feliĉe ĝi estas nur malnecesa apo. | skvělá aplikace včetně webového zpracování. Určitě krok správným směrem. | Funguje:) | Funguje bez problémů na S10e. Zatím OK. | Nespustí se a tvrdí, že mam rootnutý telefon. Mám úplně běžný nemodifikovaný Galaxy S10e s posledními aktualizacemi. I root checker potvrdil, že nemám root. | Dobrý den, jak napáruji do aplikace druhou datovou schránku? Předpokládám, že více lidí má osobní a živnostenskou datovku. Jinak aplikace asi funguje tak, jak má. Děkuji . | Velká paráda. Zvládá více datových schránek. Přístup přes prohlížeč v mobilu si sám vyžádá spuštění aplikace. | Samozřejmě nefunguje a padá. Co taky čekat, že? Ani nelze ukončit párování.  Asi si mně někdo spletl s beta-testerem :-) | Nelze používat při rootu telefonu. | Povedená aplikace. Překvapením bylo jednoduché a funkční použití při přístupu na portál občana přímo na telefonu. | Nefunkční s rootem ani s MagiskHide👌 | Is not able to work on professional (root) phones. | Skvělá aplikace, zapojil jsem jí do všech svých účtů a funguje to","{""1"":718,""2"":227,""3"":358,""4"":1130,""5"":9509}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"4.4","4.4","VARY","Ministerstvo vnitra","Ministerstvo+vnitra","mobilni.aplikace@mvcr.cz","https://www.datoveschranky.info/","Ministerstvo vnitra

Em português. | Good | Serves my needs as I suffer from CIDP. | Doesn't support other Xiaomi devices... Smart scale for example. Need to fix it. | Excellent so far | Fantastic ❤️ | Good | The app is very clean and easy to navigate. Pairing the Xiaomi s3 watch took a few seconds without any effort at all. I would like it if they expanded the activities to include how many floors climbed as part of the fitness activities. | I brought a Mi band 8 in China and after setting the region to China, It doesnt show the band where as if I scan with any other 3rd party app it shows the Mi band 8. I've tried pairing it by scanning the qr but it just scans and does nothing. | Good | Excellent | Used to have problems syncing with other devices, but the newest update let me sync with all services | 👍👍 | Very very bad rxperience | Complete and competitive! | Amazing app | Xiaomi always the best | Accurate | Simple to use...data correct record if use watch | Superb app very quick | Super | Very bad | Great app. Very useful for my lifestyle - Office Work during M-F, and weekend Physical Activities | Good app. After 3 years, of using it, I'm not disappointed 👍🏻 thanks | This helps me allot | Top | Great 👍 | Suddenly doesn't work with Samsung M21 . This app very much shocking to me. So you are requested to update this app. | This is just bad I have put my number and my password and I know the password but it won't let me in and they keep asking if I'm a robot like tf | When you send messages to the helpline no one EVER replies so it's very difficult to solve problems for a novice. I'm enjoying wearing the watch, though it can be a little slow to respond sometimes. I have the Mi 7 | I am enjoying this app. Its very informative as far as my health is concerned and works very well. Just wished the app can also cover blood sugar readings over the course of the day. | Accurate and easy to use it | THERE IS NOT A XIAMI BRAND 5 TO CONNECT IM FURIOUS | Too bad you cant stop the clock at any moment | Great app, easy to use. I wish I could add my meals and calories eaten during the day as well as water intake for the day. | Been using my MI Fitness watch for 3 years now. I totally love it and the data it gives me really motivates me to work on my fitness. Very reasonably priced. Durable. Looks great and the battery can easily carry you for 3 or 4 days. All good! | very good much better very awsome | easy & friendly to use | Has frequent disconnects that require a factory reset to repair. | Best | Quite helpful | Good experience... | It's working fine with my Xiaomi Band 8. It syncs up well and had no trouble with notifications. | Good | Excellent app for improving your health in general | Usefull daily tracking for good health it's too good | 1. Sadly it is not possible to pair with Xiaomi composition scales. Now I have to use Zepp app for scales andi Fitness app for my mi band 8 separately. 2. This app/constant connection to the mi band 8 drains all battery of my smartphone (10% of battery, zepp life in comparison spent 3%). Horrible. 3. I will return my new mi band 8 because of this app | Good. | Good. | Very smooth. Connection was easy and great features | Excellent thank you | Original Zepp life was far better than this. There is no option for US units. | Accurate and easy to sync. Notes and DND is my favorite. | Fitur tracking GPS oke, fitur statistik olahraga bagus & variatif serta UI/UX simpel | It works well | The best app | Missed notifications and VoIP calls notifications are missing from this app. The experience is very good, and if you guys added these 2 things, the app will be perfect. | Really good and easy to set up watch found everything like menus and settings really easy to navigate | Bug | Nice | Don't ask me for a review, even less with a dialog that BLOCKS usage of the app until you select an option | Perfect!! | ADD THE MI SMART SCALES ALREADY Needs an option to add Smart Scales as devices, I own a Xiaomi Composition Scale 2 and I can't use it in it's own app | Perfect for basic fitness information. Easy to use. Two thumbs up! | Good app but this is better too❤️❤️❤️ | Good | Brilliant | Grate for those who using the mi band watch | Doesn't support other Xiaomi fitness devices like scale. I cannot add my scale from Xiaomi to this application | Love this apps | Nice job, quick synchronization from watch to application and to strava. | Gud | Ever since I bought my Xiaomi Mi Band 7 and synced it to the app, there a problem with calories. I'd walk 7000 steps or more and the calories counts 2 or 3 kcal. I'm very upset about this. It's as if I bought the watch for nothing. | جيد جدا | Functional but a downgrade from band 6. | records everything and very simple to follow | Sometimes the notifications are delayed and the progress data happens to be more on the phone than on the watch, even if you don't have your phone on you. | Hello, as a perfectionist with some OCD I really dislike visually new update. It bothers me how the stats are presented. The word steps crumbling at the corner and the standing hours are forced to the further line and it doesn't fit! I just hate that. I wish I could attach the screenshot. But it's not available. So I hope I described clearly. | The screen layout could be more compact. | Please update visa payment on Xiaomi S1 active ,and replace Alexa with Google assist , they both don't work on our region. | This app is great for my new watch the most calories ive burned are 893 calories | App looks really good but its effectiveness is limited by its tendency to stop syncing with the watch on a regular basis. | Great app tells me everything I want to know | Good app | Bring back the lady that tells me how many km I've made,it's useful to keep track. Also for international use, why is there no option to use the date in a European format? | No more apps just 3 app I can install, need more app to install in my watch like calculator and more, I can't use my watch to pay in my region for brand S1 | No way to change to imperial units for workouts. | I'd read lots of negative reviews about this app but I've actually found it to be really good. Transfer of data from Zepp Life was straight forward (although did take a while). Tracking and display of data is very good and in many ways an improvement over Zepp Life. No issues with connectivity that some have had. | Its totally amazing app.i like this | Good. | One of the weakest fitness app I've ever used. Can get rid of the service announcement at the home screen. Cards on home screen are not rearrangeable, it can be just turned on and off. Cant turn off 1 km notifications in workout. Vitailty score doesn't work. 2 weeks I'm wearing Amazfit and Redmi Watch, Zepp app shows 105 PAI, this shows vitailty 1. After 11km bike ride Zepp added 23 PAI points, Mi fitness 0 Vitailty points. Maybe it watch's fault... Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro | nice | This is the best app for doing workouts, it even motivated me to go cycling at 6 AM.Thank you xiaomi | Interesting stats | Sync issues | Zepp life was better | Very nice | Good | 🤮 | Very good and accurate app. | Nice apps it's really help a lot 👍 | Enjoying sleep and jogging feedback but would want more easily accessible guidance to fully utilize more functionality. | Love the app, very easy to use and useful to find out important info about my health | Easy to use. Love that the UI is so clean. | This app is so nice | while I scan QR Code. it say not supported. why? | Very good app to control watches | Recently it keep asking me to enter mi account password. Even after entering the password it keeps on asking. Very irritating | All good except the bold fonts hide away other normal fonts when displaying the running summary. | Good design, but needs to have more dynamic analysis of health aprametets. | Great!! | 👍👍 | Good apps to track my workout,, monitor how much calorie burn.. unfortunately sometimes the apps disconnected from the mi band.. | Great apps,easy to use and get around. 5 stars | Awesome I was able to know my daily health status. | Serious notification problem. Cannot have notifications on my smartwatch (Xiaomi Watch 2). Prompts me to turn on app notifications every time i open the app. And every time i choose custom notifications, it goes back to sync all notifications. Which they dont work... | Best | Add calculator and more app | Please provide a full global firmware update in order to have full English description with Other Region syn not only China | Best | Easy to use. No complaints. | In app steps showing 5437 and in Xiaomi watch s1 active showing 4529 and kcal in app 518 and in watch 509 even after updated not fixed so what Xiaomi management doing there?????? | It's a really useful and helpful app | Lack of stability | Great | How to export reports in any other format than picture? | Ytut | Good | Perfect. Fits my requirements. | I haven't had any issues. Syncs well. No paywalls. Good features. Easy to use. | Good, but with a minus: Google Fit integration doesn't count intensity. App should sync with Google health connect not Google fit. | i take it every where i go | Easy and convenient. | Great app overall! Just wish messenger calls could also be answered. | Not accurate, differs when syncs with strava | Awesome app!! | accurate | V good | Amazing | Why does de ""discoverable"" function didn't appear in mi band 8?

Šlo mi pouze o náhradu za otrávení z restaurace, kterou má Vaše firma ve své službě. Tato recenze má pouze uvézt věci tak jak jsou. Kdyby mi šlo o Vaše poškození mluvil bych spíše o tom jak se mnou komunikovala a jednala Vaše podpora. | payment refused, help support not helpful, paying monthly for seevice that does not work and no one tells you why or when it starts working again... | Při výběru nejsou vidět pro benefity, pouze v košíku. Bolt má lepší vyhledávání | Foodora sucks. Really annoying | Super aplikace, mám jenom jeden problém který mě stál už 1500 Kč je že když použiji kupon z sodexo a pladba online neprojde nebo se my neotevrě okno na potvrzení platby tak kód pro slevu se použije když se mi to stalo poprvé čekala jsem že se po chvíli kod bude znovu moct použit ale ne takhle jsem přišla o minimálně 1500 Kč Děkuji za vyřešení problém, teď jestli dovolíte jdu jist nic protože jsem utratila peníze na jídlo na 3 dny za nic | Love it no cap | Nelze objednat a zaplatit přes GooglePay, protože zbytečné ověření nefunguje. Kód z SMS prý není správný. Od 10:16 nechodí sms vůbec. Naprosto ubohé, to jsem si jídlo mohl vyzvednout osobně. | Terrible user experience. It happened to me couple of times that order was paid and then cancelled. | Bad customer experience | There is no possibility of delivering something without stealing - there is always something missing in the order More than 4 orders - ALWAYS something wrong | Stupid new name, how could you advertise eggs for 9,9 CZK ea 😂 separating receipts for food and the delivery is painful 😡 | Jídla jsou v aplikaci nastřelená tak o min. 30-70 Kč oproti cenám osobně v podniku + cena za dopravu, za službu. Nechápu jak si někdo odtud objednává 😀 | Stupid ad that must be closed more than 3x so here is my response. Nope. I have to close one ad, only to get another screen, which leads to another. And each close button is so small that it is hard to close it without opening it. Why would I trust company with my money when they cheat me with advertising? | Už 2x mi odečetli peníze, ale objednávka se zrušila.. Chybí jakákoliv možnost se někam obrátit na podporu/vrácení peněz | Coupon did not work for first purchase. Also, it says free delivery but actually they still add delivery fee in the end. | I really hate u guys | Naprostá spokojenost. Jen by kurýři mohli číst poznámky, když už tam ta možnost je. Mám upřesnění k adrese a stejně 3 z 5 bloudí. | You will be charged full price even if they don't actually deliver your order. Wolt is better. Edit: I did contact your useless support team and have been denied a refund time and time again. You're just a scam operation at this point | I made an order and at the same time I have updated my phone number in their system. After waiting for two hours, I get an email saying that the courier couldn't reach me. I immediately reached out to foodora through their help center as they say on their website is that they can retry the deliver. There was no response.Instead of acknowledging the system problem and addressing the lapse in communication, I received responses that shifted blame onto me, the customer. | They did not deliver food for 880 czk, refuse to refund money but gave me coupon. However, they did not inform me that coupon can be used only once. According to support I should have been going myself and see the rules before accepting the coupon. Yeah, sure, on the phone, also I wasn't given any choice. I would prefer money if course. I used half of the coupon, and I thought I will use the other half later. But of course, no. So they simply got 495czk from me for nothing. | Works well enough but when browsing the menu of a restaurant sometimes the content jumps under your fingers because the header ads change (even when they are not visible on the screen). | Uz opet funkcni a prijde mi, ze se i slutba zlepsila. | Na karte udelali double charge a nejdou kontaktovat. Na vsechny moznosti dostavam jen automatickou odpoved. Doporucuju pouzivat jinou spolecnost, tohle je snad nejhorsi pristup co jsem u food delivery firmy, kdy videl. Live support je absolutni must have u donasky. | Had an unpleasant experience with the delivery of my food. I ordered donuts to a reception at my office. During the arrival of the courier I was at a meeting, could not pickup the goods and the courier left with my food. I was told this was unrefundable. | They can easily take your money and time of delivery will constantly grow. Once you ask what's going on they say that courier is unassigned – so they're simply faking delays while not paying enough for stuff. Asked to claim & report and issue – got ""I can't influence the situation"", no idea what they get their salaries for | Kdyz vam neco chybi v objednavce, dostanete voucher, ale kdyz ho vyuzijete, ze si znovu objednate to co vam neprislo, tak vam to pekne nauctujou. | Very poor service You cancelled my order and No REFUND of my money, im always order at the same address and easily find that address ...😒 | App is ""OK"", but the amount of forced adds for discounts etc., kills the user experience. Also sad you need to ""tip"" the driver to be in ""priority delievery"" ... WTH is that? Delivery already adds ""service fee"" for that no? ... Redo app to give tips after delivery not prior to it, esp. when drivers can deliver food spilled, cold, etc. Switching to other delivery app soon I guess. | Podvodná aplikace. Dříve dáme jídlo. Pozor na ně, snaží se vás dostat! Speciálně ten trik s novým zákazníkem je nepříjemný! | Please outsource your mobile IT services to someone competent. About one in three of your ads freeze, requiring restart of the app from which the ad ran. Super annoying. I'm definitely not using your app any more - who knows what eldritch horrors lurk within? Edit: The ads freeze in all apps where they appear. No other companies' ads do this on my phone. | Quality of deliveries going down, good customer support otherwise totally terrible experience, after years deleted ACC and don't trust to return... | Fakt mě štve, že jste ABSOLUTNĚ nespolehliví, co se týká času doručení. Přece není možný, že si člověk objedná jídlo, vy tvrdí že že u nás bude za 45 minut, uběhne 55 munut a vy ještě ani nepotvrdíte objednávku, nedáte vědět,nic ? To jste se snad zbláznili tvl, fakt. Doručujete to snad v kočáře Popelky nebo co???? | I disabled promo notfications but this app keeps spamming me with offers several times a day | The app is great there is a lot of discounts and promocodes but I hate it cause I can't use them because if you have a promocode or if the food have a discount you need to pay by card (put your card information) you can't choose to buy by cash it doesn't show up and if you shop without discounts you can pay by cash but it will cost you a lot why did they make it like that horrible desicion😔😔😔 | Snadná registrace, nechce to po vás 60 různých ověření když se prihlašujete na jiném zařízení, oproti WOLTu kde jsem si pro to jídlo nakonec radši došel sám. | just a scam, careful, they trying to steal from you, prices raised about 100 % more in selected restaurants, how these criminals are allowed in app store | Značka foodora hodně pozvedla standard. | Easy to use, very handy. | it is nearly impossible to receive a food. Waited for 2.5 hours for my delivery. And it's not the first time I have such an issue. But when I ordered the food - delivery time was 50 min, not even close to real delivery time | They stopped accepting electronic meal vouchers. Now they just take the money, cancel the order, and never refund anything. Support doesn't do anything. Electronic meal vouchers were the only reason I was using this garbage. | Vynikajicí | The worth delivery service. Order are always late. Often not complete. | Edit: Tak jsem zase 2x objednával - dodací doba 90 minut u obou. Rebrand špatné službě nemůže pomoci....Původní verze: Fakt naposled co jsem si tady objednával. Čekací doba 2x delší než u konkurence. Nejde zrušit objednávku minutu po zadání. Moje adresa podle nich neexistuje. | Good | -5 stars, the worst food ordering app ever, thanks to them competition have extra job. Hungry spend 2times over 1 hour trying to order, either didn't work or the checkout price allmost double out of nowhere. | neslo zaplatit zadanou kartou, duvod neuveden, pred Ggl pay to slo 🤪 casto nejde objednat z Wokin, jsem smutny ... nesel update, neslo tedy objednat, iz je to davno -Update neproběhne 1.4.2022 🤨 | Huraaqaa | K čemu mi je odhad casu když dopředu víte že ho nedokážete splnit. Je to prostě příšerný. ""Vaši příští objednávku vyřídíme lépe"" - ne já si už nic neobjednam, protože já si cením svůj čas. Kdybyste aspoň vrátili čast peněz... Ceny vyšší v nabídce než při checkoutu. Prostě celkově je to trash. | В последнее время постоянно держат заказ неподтверждённым по часу, а потом отменяют | Jídlo cca za 1000 jsem objednal v 17:30. V 18:30 aplikace tvrdí dalších 90 minut. Přes hodinu se snažím objednávku zrušit. Centrum pomocí nefunguje a stále se mě to snažilo připojit do nějakého chatu. V 19:40 mi přijde email že jídlo bylo doručeno a tak už nic zrušit nejde. Asi v půl jedenácté zvoní kurýr u baráku. Už asi týden mám požadavek na zákaznické podpoře, ale nikdo nereaguje :-(. Super služba fakt :-(. | Why not translate the text to English?? | Za stejnou objednávku ve Foodora 441 Kč a v KFC rozvoz 300. Jejich premium s dopravou zdarma se nevztahuje na většinu restauraci ale to se dozvíte až po zaplacení (určitě to je někde schované malými písmenky). Pokud máte možnost, tak ruce pryč a radši objednat napřímo. | Fairly easy to use | Pro subscription is very useless. Do not buy it. | Byla by to fajn aplikace když by šla s dobou a když by tam byly nějaké normální způsoby platby. Třeba bitcoin, takhle vám to nabídne nějaký kupón a platba jen zastaralou kartou ( ani nenabídne hotově ), takže v dnešní době nepoužitelné. Lepší tedy zajít přímo do restaurace a zaplatit tam bitcoinem, v dnešní době už cca 1000 restaurací přes QRko v ČR toto umožňuje. Snad Foodora půjde časem s dobou a nabídne tuto možnost také | V aplikaci se dá zobrazit čas doručení, ale ne čas objednání, tím pádem nelze zjistit zákazníkovi, kolik trvalo dodání objednávky. Trošku nefér přístup. | Odhady časů rozvozu neodpovídají realitě. I když mají problémy s rozvozem, stále klamou nereslistickym odhadem při objednávce. Po zaplacení jsou odhady dosti náhodné, 10-20min, 30-40, 10-20, 50-60 a pořád dokola, až to trvá přes 2h tj 3x tak dlouho než úvodní odhad. Není to poprvé, kdy s nimi mám problém. Zatím jsem používal jen Foodoru k dovážení jídla a tak je čas se rozloučit a zkusit nějakou novou službu. Nespolehlivost a klamání zákazníků jsou pro mě stopkou. | It takes 90 minutes to deliver order for 2 kms, two orders twice in a row same result. They will ruin your day with useless support that knows only how to give you BS voucher or cancel your order. THEY DO NOTHING TO IMPROVE THEIR MISTAKES SO THEY DO NOT APPEAR AGAIN. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU. DO NOT RECOMMEND, SAVE YOUR TIME EVADING THIS USELESS OVERPRICED SERVICE | I was waiting 3 hours for the delivery. Shops were canceling order after 1-2 hours of waiting. | Až moc pop-upu (výběr adresy, blesková sleva, vyhřej iPhone a td.) - dejte mi už konečně objednat jídlo. No, a ještě nějaká reklama po objednávce. | Jidlo sice dovezou, ale kazdy den otravuji s recenzi na stejnou restauraci i ba jidlo, ktere jsem mel uz mnohokrat. Vyhledavani jidel nefunguje, vysledky jsou restaurace, ktere jidlo nemaji (placena reklama, aby se objevili v kazdem hledani?). | When this was still Dáme Jídlo the experience was great but since the acquisition they introduced more and more extra charges. The last one is ridiculous. If you don't pay extra to guarantee the courier goes directly from restaurant to your home, he actually picks up the food and then drives it around for more than half an hour when delivering to other customers (more than 3). It also doubled the estimated delivery time. That's it. I will use any other food delivery service than this one. | vždy pozdě, vždy studené | Verification doesnt work, i cant finish my order. App cant verify 4-digit code correctly. | Dáme jídlo bylo pilířem pro dovoz jídla v Praze, první z prvních. Neustále slevy a nabídky, rychlý rozvoz, jedinečný výběr restaurace. Update 2023: Foodora je horší a horší, a je to opravdu jídlo, dovozy z restaurací jsou delší a delší. Předražené ceny, kopírování systému z jiných aplikací a špatný servis (žádná fungující podpora). Dnes objednávka v 19:18 z restaurace, 20-30 minut odhadované doručení. Trvalo 1 a půl hodiny nyní je 20:42 :) Fakt prosím o zřízení lepšího systému. | One delivery missing 70% of order (support refused to deliver missing items), next order 40 minutes delayed (food cold and soggy, support refused to return money), useless helpline (returning ""credits"" at 10 pm means hungry customer). Would give 0 *s. Brutal. Cancelling my account and never using again. | Exceptional | Nejhorší donášková služba v ČR. Nehodnotím aplikaci ale službu, naprosto otřesné, podpora pomalá a neschopná. Nikomu nedoporučuji 🤙 Edit: Už přes týden to s vámi řeším ale vy mi stále odmítáte vrátit peníze. Nehorázné, jen čekám až to konečně nějak čestně vyřešíte abych si tu vaší zpatlaninu mohl odinstalovat. | Good enough to use by tourist. It has english functions and easy to use | They stole 1000 czk from me 🤬🤬🤬 | The estimate was 25–35 minutes; real delivery took over an hour. Apparently too many customers and too little honesty. I can report one customer less, though. | Looong waiting time. | Had to wait 2 hours for a delivery from McDonald's that's less than 1km away. | User friendly and fast | Aplikace pro mě funguje v pořádku, nikdy jsem s ní neměl problém. Taková malá drobnost by byla aktualizace adres, ale pokud to bere z Google map, tak je vše v pořádku.( Moje adresa není na Google mapách, tak proto). Správnou adresu mám v poznámce a nikdy jsem problém s doručením neměl. | Čekání na objednávku 2 hod, nelze zrušit, mrtvá podpora | easy to use and good variety of restaurants with nice offers :) | Delivery arrived casually 3 HOURS LATE. NO APOLOGY, NO COMMUNICATION, NO CUSTUMOR SERVICE. IN THE END NO FOOD DELIVERED AT ALL!!!!! | Recommended | Good app | Odhad casu kdy jidlo dorazi je extremne nespolehlivy. Opakovane (ca v 30% pripadu) uz se mi stalo ze jidlo dorazilo o pul hodiny pozdeji nez bylo avizovano. | Zákaznická podpora po doruceni spatne objednávky otresna. Mapa v aplikaci ukazuje nereálné polohy. | Good app with good services and wide variety of restaurants/stores to order from. P.S. Thank you for the Foodora PRO free monthly :) | Bad | The prices advertised before placing the order are completely different from the ones at the checkout. The app shows free delivery when you choose, but adds up the delivery cost at checkout, which I consider to be false advertising. The app also adds up ""service fees"". The final price (food and delivery) ends up higher than the same order placed with the competitors despite the same food price and the seemingly better ""initial offer"" that is advertised before the order is actually placed. | Skvela aplikace, nicmene poslednich par dni me to otravuje se zadavanim adresy pri kazdem otevreni aplikace. Uz nekolik let mam vsechny adresy ulozene, neni duvod proc prudit s kazdym otevrenim. Je to tak neuveritelne otravne, ze si kolikrat rozmyslim objednat uz jen kvuli frustraci. | Aplikece je zcela funkční, ale snad se mi nestalo že bych dostal obědnané jídlo načas. Místo 25-30 min dostanu objednávku většinou do 45-70 min. | Just bad | Nejdou vypnout otravné reklamy v notifikacích. Jedině vypnout všechny notifikace, ale pak se zase nedozvím, že mi brzy dorazí jídlo. | Služba na nic. První objednávka bez vysvětlení zrušená. Druhá spíš předkrm než inzerované hlavní jídlo, třetí o 30 minut zpožděná snídaně, navíc úplně studená. Fakt to nemá cenu, ani se slevami, natož bez nich. Radši si zajděte někam poblíž sami. | Great app | Dal bych 4* ale hvězda dolů, dnes opět problém... Objednal jsem si jídlo... 30 min doručení, oki pohoda po 25 mi napsali že nic nebude že je objednávka zrušena protože prodejna nestíhá... Ok stane se dostal jsem kupon jako omluvu... A ejhle on nejde použít pri platbě v hotovosti.. takže nahovno ... Díky takže hodina a čtvrt čekání na jídlo za plnou cenu ... Pohoda | I like ordering food from time to time but recently the app has become really annoying by constantly pushing promotions that are not relevant to me. I tried to turn off the ""Special offers and promotions"" notification category but the notification spam continues | perfekt | One complaint... there is a bonus 150Kč for selected restaurants each day or so. But if the restaurant closes or you add something to the order and then you change your mind in favor of other restaurant then you're losing that bonus. I usually opt for different food delivery app for that day. Edit: This time I couldn't complete my order ""Unknown error, try again later"". Tried different card etc., no success. Restarting app, losing bonus, and voila, I could proceed basically paying 150Kč extra | Giving one start cause I can't give 0. I swapped the language so I could understand and still all the menus and important things are in the original language (great!) Also I was promised discount for first costumers and I haven't seen any discount on my first order... Disappointed with it. Not using it anymore. | Works well once you triple your delivery time. Sad story. 3 stars down... | Such a scam, so expensive. Bolt food is better. | Vyhledávání je katastrofa. Aplikace najde spoustu restaurací, z nichž ani jedna(!!!) nenabízí vyhledávanou položku. | Very well designed! Great service too | Good application to have on the phone . Easy and fast delivery. | After years of semi-daily ordering, it is time to drop the app. Courier can ""eliminate"" your food if you fail to catch him on time for whatever reason. Your food won't be dropped by your first locked door, because that is not a couriers responsibility - Customer support. No refunds. | Nice app | 13 kč poplatek za objednávku, dámejídlo bylo lepší | Bugs everywhere. Seriously, how can an app like this be so broken and inconvenient to use. Even when the app wanted me to rated, it just opened an empty email form, with no address to send to! Food selection is nice though. | Funguje výborně, poskytuje všechny potřebné informace, výběr jídel je fajn, platba bezproblémová, prostě pět hvězdiček jako vyšitých! | Sometimes it is confusing to get to the list of all restaurants | Could not login to google account to check my delivery status I made on the web | You guys are amazing, I'm only giving you 4 stars because your sales aren't great | They advertise to me in English but their app only works in Czech. | No customer service. How many times have not brought my goods, even now when I ordered only polozhki in the store, I brought only 1 of 3. Support does not help in any way, you can say that it does not work at all. It's horrible. I've never seen anything like this and I don't recommend it. It's so exhausting it already makes me want to cry. I'm sorry, but I'm paying for the service as well. This is just Scam and deception. | Super expensive, they are losing track of what it means to be a delivery service and provide premium services and other nonsense. Packaging for 25 czk?? For that 1 cardboard box? And a service fee and other fees... suddenly 1 egg fried rice costs you 300czk Shady business - uninstalled. And no, it is not the same with wolt or bolt food, your deliceries are always 60czk more expensive | I don't like the customer support at all. I received wrong order and they didn't offer me to send me the correct order! Unprofessional approach... | Bohuzel neda se platit bitcoinem, takze v 21. Stoleti k nicemu | Good app, does what you expect from it, user friendly, intuitive and stable so far, no crashes for me. One idea for improvement, after an order, put a status panel for the active order on the app home page. | Too much fees on the customers. Restaurant owners should be paying the delivery fees and ""service fees"". Total service fees are more expesive than the meal itself sometimes which doesnt make any sense to order a meal. | Zrušené, opožděné objednávky - žádný compensation... Několikrát mi restaurace zrušila objednávku po cca 30 min, a od Foodory jen omluva v SMS 🤬. No compensation for the delayed, cancelled orders for the restaurants' side. It happened to me several times, that restaurant has just cancelled my order 30 minutes after, so I had to start with new order from another restaurant. Delayed delivery is every 2nd order... They don't even ask for feedback, how was your order etc.. | Terrible experience with this new company! My wife ordered and asked them to come up using the elevator as it is late and she is alone with 2 babies and can't get down. They were nop we dont come up come down. She had to get with 2 babies ! . We order almost 4 times a week and we give tips to the riders as an apprciation. We won't use this service any more. Using wolt is much better | Can't view reviews in latest update. | Servis je v pořádku, ale když vidím reklamy na foodoru na každém kroku, který udělám na internetu, už se mi ta appka spíš znechutila a raději objednám z jiné, kterou mi nikdo necpe. Nejsem nový zákazník, nemám nárok na objednávky zdarma, nepotřebuji vidět tyto reklamy. | Podvodné promokody v aplikaci a neschopní pracovníci centru podpůry. Aplikace možná funguje dobře, ale nemám rád když se mi někdo snaží podvest. | The application ordered items for me. And payed for me Re: to dev i did And didn't solve anything re: i don't give a freck about your app anymore. And f you if you ask evidence months later. May review will be one star until you have an app. Enjoy | The app is stupid - suggesting a tip for the delivery person before the delivery is completed. If there's a tip option, it should come as a separate (optional) transaction after delivery completed without delay or other problems. Tipping beforehand is simply bad. | The delivery system is the worst, as it usually experiences delays of 7 - 15 minutes. During lunchtime, the delays can extend beyond 1 hour. Moreover, the customer support is also unsatisfactory. | Horrible experiemce, ordered food from restaurant 100m from us (Karlin) and delivery guy went around us(!) To Zizkov, Florenc etc... adding odd 30min for pizza (!) delivery... Application doesn't say anything about how many stops he has remaining etc... | Naprosto mizerná služba. Jídlo objednáno, zaplaceno a 10 minut před doručením objednávka zrušena. Podpora problematická. Dostat z nich peníze je na dlouho. Problemy se opakuji. Nedoporučuji používat. | My delivery was cancelled three times in a row after waiting full estimated time | Chci pochvalit technickou podporu Foodory. Velmi promptne zabezpecili duplikat uctenky. Dobra prace! | Nejotravnejsi aplikace co mam. 3 notifikace za hodinu. | Doesn't work at all. Says no delivery to my address in the city center. Of course there is delivery, but I have to order using the web interface. | My pizza was over 2 hours late and no compensation. Won't even bother with this app or trying to get compensation. | Firma se postupně dosti zhoršila, pasivně agresivní zákaznická podpora v případě stížnosti na kvalitu doručení nebývala za doby Damejidlo zvykem. Pamatujeme lepší časy. | Aplikace je funkční a celkem normální. Otravné jsou velmi časté propagační notifikace. Služba, jako taková, je, nicméně, jako vystřižená z devadesátých let - skryté poplatky, slevy, které jsou ve skutečnosti spíše přirážkami, vše zcela bez záruky. Vaše jídlo bude zpravidla jezdit hodinu po městě, aby vám ho nezletilý kurýr, který nemluví vaším jazykem, zcela studené a zapařené podal okýnkem z auta, ke kterému si musíte dojít přes půl bloku. Bezkonkurenčně nejhorší rozvozová služba ve městě. | The worst possible. Your advertisement is annoying. When trying to close, most of the time the stupid thing opens play store or web page. Therefore I don't want to see your advertising. I dont a i will not use your services as they are unavailable anyway. Do something. | Pořád ruší objednávky, předražený dovoz a neustále problémy s aplikací. Doporučuji Wolt👍🏻 | Delivery fee may say one thing, but right before you order, it can be increased because of busy time - like 0 czk to 110 czk. Very sneaky. Ordered at 11:42 and delivery time said 60 minutes. Received delivery at 13:42. 2 hours later. The app displayed, and the agent wrote continuously only 10 more minutes. To bad I can't tell my hunger that! Offered 200czk vouchure as an appeasement, but we decided to delete the app and let Foodora keep the 200czk. They'll need it at this rate. | Za tu extrémně hlasitou a agresivní reklamu | What even? The inability to sort restaurants by ""open"" is dumb. What even is ""order for later"", did anyone ever use that feature? (I'd be surprised if yes...) The new app is confusing and unintuitive, especially when drunk, the restaurant options also seem to have shrunk... | Podpora je hrozná kupón 200 kč za referall nefungoval ani mě ani kamarádovy pak jsme napsali na podporu po několika hodinách jsme dostali nový kupón ten nefungoval tak jsme napsali na podporu restaurace se už zavřeli a kupón opravili ale dali aby vypršel ten den tak jsem psala znovu na podporu nastavili to na měsíc ale jsem bez jídla a nulová kompenzace také když se podpora zeptá ještě něco a něco připíšu tak si to nepřečtou často a ukončí chat také některé restaurace vůbec nečtou poznámky | Chtěl jsem si koupit PRO, a appka crashuje vždy při přidání platební karty. Po novém updatu mi jen zmizel celý košík (bez žádné historie), appka stále padá při placení. Chtěl jsem zaplatit, ale nejde to. Nové jméno, software ještě horší než předtím, a to už je co říct. Jo a ještě to, že se mi ukazovala reklama po objednání jídla? To je fakt žumpa. EDIT: Jasně, to, aby vám moje platba dorazila, o to se staráte, zbytek je vám ""líto"". Dokud neodstraníte ty hrozné reklamy *po zaplacení*(!), 1🌟👎 | Totally not functioning app. Tried to log in for first time (had a damejidlo account before) had to reset password. When resseting and log in demanding additional stupid email or sms authentication did not work no email no sms. After few tries... Uninstall and take your services to .... Uff tried to look for some food in your app without login in. What a hell is that totally unfriendly, confusing and frustrating to get to any order. Never ever will use you for sure. | I'm sad I cannot attach screenshots of our dialogs with them.. if you are ready to swallow the humiliation when you will be brain***d for two weeks, waiting for them to stop pretending that they are working on a refund for an unfulfilled order, then use it, they deliver food even at night, it's cool. In CZ: Pokud jste připraveni spolknout to ponížení, když vám budou dva týdny vymývat mozek a tvářit se, že se pracuje na vrácení peněz za nesplněnou objednávku, tak toho využijte, jídlo je i v noci | Great service dude, love Daniil. If I could tip the service guy, I would. He solved our problem with wrong order coming in very well. This is a formal thank you to Daniil! Keep being amazing my guy! | Aplikace nutici minimalni castku je pro jednotlivce k nicemu. Polevka se do toho proste nevejde, ani pripadne jeden smart od kfc, takze nezbejva nez nemocny risknout a porusit karantenu a zaject si sam, nebo si objednat neco, co nechci. | You can pay by cash, good offer | The stupid payment gateway doesn't work... I cannot even redeem my coupon | Please | Pozor, mnoho věcí je v aplikaci podvod! U některých restaurací píši doprava zdarma, ale po proklikání je vám doprava naúčtována!! | Nonsensual promise of time delivery thats the main reason why i rate this 1 star. Never ever i recieved my food on time. It is the only thing that matters. Its a food delivery company... What else matters? How can Foodora expalin this? There are no valid excuse to explain this poor customer service. It would take much less time and certainly it would even be cheaper to just drive to any of these restaurant that foodora provides service for yourself. Dont even try to answer this its pathetic. | Worst delivery company. | Poslední dobou naprosto příšerný. Jedna objednávka mi byla dovezena o hodinu a půl později než měla (vyřešeno kupónem). Dnes (v poledne!) jsem si objednal jídlo znovu a po cca hodině čekání byla objednávka prostě zrušena :--). Což je super, když člověk třeba s něčím počítá a do poslední chvíle je přesvědčen o tom, že to dostane. Opravdu otřesné a už si asi budu objednávat pouze od konkurence, kde to nějak magicky funguje. Jediná funkce vaší služby je dovážka jídla a ani toho nejste schopní. | Na pixelu 4a Android 13 často nejde přidat poznámku k položce v objednávce, nejde přidat podnik do oblíbených. Kdyby šlo přidat problém report v appce, tak taky bych nedávala sem recenzi s jednou hvězdičkou. | stole my money | Dark theme was suddenly removed from the app, now it is horribly bright. | The best food delivery in Prague 🤌 | This is ridiculous. Ahhha. My first order in the app got failed. I am waiting for my money back. | Frauds. Selling 2 for price of 1, first make it sound like you will get 2 meals for price of 1, and then deliver you 1 meal for even bigger price than what it costs in the restaurant. And then they tell you you did not order from 2 for 1 section (which you did). Ordinary burger in Czechia for 20 euros. Shameful shameful. And prices are in general quite higher than in restaurants. People like this should go out of business. | foodora je tak debilni jmeno 🤣😂🤣 Co to vymyslelo za dite 🤣😂 | Objednal jsem jidlo s dorucenim za 40 min, ihned po objednani vyskocila doba doruceni na 100 min. Nulova zakaznicka podpora. Nikde neni zadny kontakt. NEDOPORUCUJI! | Nejhorší, support nefnguje, lžou o době doručení | Only getting worse now with a new confusing name. Like it wasn't confusing enough before trying to find a restaurant i know is there for half an hour. Bring back the old name at least 💀 | Captcha. | Neexistující zakáznická podpora. Naprostý trash. Objednávka zpoždění 2hodiny a nemůžu nikoho kontaktovat. Stáhněte si radši Bolt food. | Not for the app, but for the services. | Změněný vyhledávací systém který vůbec nefunguje | The service fee is a joke. Used to be a big fan of DJ but now it is Bolt all the way. | It would be great to have the exact time of order, not just the time of delivery, so this could be used to see how much late the delivery actually was. Recently, a lot of late deliveries have happened as restaurants are not able to comply with their delivery times. Paying 140 CZK for delivery and packaging and then waiting twice the advertised time is not acceptable. | Worst app | good app for busy people | I used to use this app quite a lot but I think I will move to the competition as there are too many things bothering me. They give you points for orders but they expire very soon so I never have chance to use them. I would need to place several orders per week. Also, they promise 200 czk for recommending another person. I did that, my partner ordered food but after many months we never saw promised reward. | Z akeho dovodu je nutne pri platbe sodexo poukazkou zaplatit 10kc Servisní poplatok osobitne kartou... | The worst food delivery app I've ever experienced | Appka nejde zapnout, nekonečný loading, uninstall, clear cache, clear data. Nic nepomohlo 🤷 | servis dobrý, ale chtělo by to umožnit více funkcí ve filtru, například aby mi vyjely ty společnosti,. co berou i stravenky... | Výborná služba, bohužel v mém okolí je příliš mnoho špatných restaurací nebo restauraci z kterých nechci objednávat. Kéž by existovala možnost danou restauraci permanentně skrýt, pak by pro mě mělo i větší smysl objednávat přes dáme jídlo. | Nejhorší jednání že strany podpory zákazníka při problémech s apkou. Radši konkurenci. | super service | Crashed | Absolutne nefunkční firma | Good service. | So far I lost around 700Kč because of Dame Jidlo. Their support is unhelpful, and will always say that everything is your fault. If you have other options do not use, I'm not going to order from them ever again. | Ru language, serious ? | The app has many issues especially with the payment. Once I've accidentally ordered the same thing twice because the app behaved as if the order didn't go though. The support didn't do anything about it. Also, don't bother giving the drivers tips via the app. They won't get it. Apparently, Dáme jídlo just takes it for themselves as a commission. The service used to be ok, but it feels like it's just getting worse and worse. | I had a destroyed pizza, contacted support and they did nothing. They said that they would get back to me. They never did. | Reklamy na tuto aplikaci v aplikacích 3. stran mají tak malý křížek na zavření reklamy, že ve většině případů místo zavření se otevře nevyžádaně aplikace Dáme jídlo. | Aplikace neustále otravuje s nabídkami. V aplikaci je možno vypnout jen odběr newsletteru a oznámení. Obojí vypnuté a aplikace mi neustále každý den cinká a nabízí slevy. Odinstalovavam. | The app is broken! Cannot order anything from dame market after spending half an hour on choosing the stuff! | Fraud. I ordered food, my order disappeared from app and they took my money. Nobody answered on my emails, and they do not have some customer service phone number. Do not install this app. | Nejhorší servis doručení jídla během Vánoc Označujou objednávku jako doručenou a pak se nelze spojit s kurýrem | Nepouzivat radeji objednejte pre bolt. Doruceni jen pomale a aplikace zobrazuje jen vhvilku nekdy i pres hodinu a nekdy Vam objednavku nedoruci vubec. Je to nespolehlive, zadna realna Podpora nebo moznost kontaktovat se s kuryrem. Navic ceny za dopravu i jidlo jsou oproti konkurenci premrstene. | Orders are often not delivered if you miss a phone call from the driver, no refund or credit given for 3 hr delivery of cold food. Rude customer service. | Easy to browse and order | Gotten worse and worse. You pay more now for just getting the food delivered and its normally takes longer for the food to get delivered than it ever had before. | 👌 | Zákaznícky servis 0. Snažil som sa nahlásiť problém 15-20min ale nevedel som kontaktovať podporu. Problém bol v tom, že kuriér mi volal, no mne neprišiel hovor (zvonenie bolo zapnuté, a mal som ho pri sebe) a teda zrušil objednávku. Po nahlásení problemu mi oznámili, že peniaze mi nevrátia a objednávka sa taktiež nedá doručiť. Neprejavili žiadne úsilie o vyriešenie problému. Iba sa ohradili na obchodné podmienky a na to, že to nie je ich problém. Neodporúčam. | I love the deals on here and the dame market but the app has serious issues with payment. All methods of payment are rejected. It's not my bank rejecting the purchases, I checked and tried multiple cards. I even deleted my account and payment worked for awhile but isn't again. Customer service is no help. | THE WORST APPLICATION EVERY I ORDERED AND NEVER RECEIVED THE ORDER ! | Placed an order for 500kc. No received it. No contact. Unhelpful agent. Don't use!

Prosím více UI elementů při brouzdání produktu. | Otravna aplikacia, stale vyhadzuje reklamy | Suddenly started to send ads about various sales through notifications. Unacceptable for me | Extremely slow and buggy. I'm getting a message ""Error occured, please try again later"" which is totally unhelpful and cannot proceed with my purchase. | I will give you zero, I tried to reset my password because I wanted to return some goods. I do not know if it's only me but every time I get an item , it comes with fault. So, I am not able to reset it. It sucks!! switching to DATART | Gazilion bugs, unusable | Sice mám Alza+, ale zásadně nakupuji přes webový eshop. Aplikace se chová divně i na S22 ultra... Kromě občasné chyby při placení mě nejvíce štve neplynulé skrolování... Nedá se na to koukat... | Teljes házhozszállítást kértem, régi készülék elszállításával, kicsomagolással, beszereléssel és csomagolás elszállításával. (7.990 Ft, mindkét opció ki lett pipálva!!) Kizárólag ezen szolgáltatás miatt választottam az Alzát. A régi gépet elvitték, de a szolgáltatás többi része nem valósult meg. A futár cég és az Alza egymásra mutogat, az ügyfél meg szív. | Excellent app | Maximální nespokojenost s podporou v kontaktním centru a službou alza +. Zkrátka přišla jsem o možnost zaplatit při vyzvednutí a hodnocení služeb a výrobků po nákupu tyto služby. Reklamovat taky nějde, kontaktní centrum zájem o prověření nemá ani hovor s operátorem nejde ohodnotit. Výsměch. | Couldn't able to login | Good | Fast, no lugs so far. Recommend | After updating to ver 9.37.0, the app became useless, cannot login at all, error ""AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED, Identity server is down or no internet - Try again""! | Momentalne už nejaký čas nefunguje prihlásenie (aplikácia spadne vždy pri pokuse), takže je nepouziteľná, ale kým fungovala, tak bola skvelá. | Favourites don't work. Open menu shows loading error. Google pay works occasionally. | Nejhorší appka a obchod v ČR. Už se mi stalo tolikrát, že jsem měl všechno v košíku, jim se nepovedla platba a všechno z košíku letělo pryč na /dev/null a musel jsem všechno hledat od začátku. Tolikrát nešlo zboží zaplatit, vyzvednout, schválit... To jsou za ty roky hodiny a dny práce. Smazal jsem účet, odinstalovat appku a už se hned cítím líp. | 🤮 | Vtipné, najít teď kolik recenzí produktů, které byly bezdůvodně zamítnuty... | Nice app | Aplikace často se odhlásí | Aplikace ze začátku byla úžasná s širokým výběrem sortimentu. Ale teď třeba už to tak není, zároveň se aplikace seká, není to nic jako CZC, ale seká se a někdy nejdou načíst samotné produkty. Vždycky jsem byl za to, že Alza je lepší než CZC. Teď je to vyrovnané a možná CZC je lepší, jen kvůli tomu, že byl změněn sortiment zboží a někdy jsou zbytečně předražený ceny u produktů (jako třeba FERA 5 chladič od SPC za 19000KČ). Budu aplikaci nadále využívat, ale jsem zklamán. | Stopped work after last update!!!!! | Pozitivni: Vetsina funkci co je na webu je i v aplikaci, vcetne reklamaci. Negativni: automaticke odhlasovani je opravdu, ale opravdu velmi otravne! Aspon pred nim varujte, at uzivatel nemusi resit prihlasovani, kdyz chce zrovna vyzvednout objednavku. zdrzuje to v nejnevhodnejsi chvili, nove prihlaseni by melo byt jednodussi, treba na jeden otisk prstu, ne to jeste cekat na sms, kterou jsem v nastaveni pred par dny vypnul a dnes byla 2fa znovu zapnuta | Aplikace je povětšinou dobrá ale už podruhé se mi stalo že se aplikace zasekla a má jen genetickou hlášku o zpracování požadavků. restart telefonu změna připojení internetu nic nepomáhá. | Není možnost změnit způsob reklamace z možnosti ""dobropis"", I když reklamujete do šesti měsíců. Když napíšete do komentáře že vyloženě žádáte výměnu, Alza Vám jen vrátí peníze a vyloženě se s Vámi hádá, že jste žádal dobropis a tím pádem je reklamace vyřízená řádně. Tímto jsem přišla o TV a nyní i o hodinky. | Works as expected, or even better :) | Package late, sending annoying messages with deliver date change. I'll never order again. 🤮 | Nutnost stáhnout si pokaždé 40 MB aplikaci pro výdej - proč nelze zahájit výdej přes internet? A když už se chce člověk vyhnout čekání, nemělo by po 15 min 'Ještě chvíli' trvat dalších 20+ minut čekání. A rozhodně ne poprvé. | Keep getting Errors in the app and terrible customer service. No one is there to assist you. | orders can not be paid and also pick up is not working to much often | Bola to veľmi dobre fungujúca aplikácia ale v priebehu posledného polroka ju komplet dosrali. Dark mode nepoužiteľný. V zozname produktov sú náhľadové obrázky strašne malé. Nerozumiem prečo si robíte zo zákazníkov testerov. Nedá sa prihlásiť na viacero účtov naraz, napríklad súkromný a firemný. Vyzdvihnutie cez telefón je pre firmu nepoužiteľné. | Nepracuje při zapnuté VPN. I při vypnuté neustále hlásí infantilní hlášky ""jejda, něco se pokazilo"". | Worst eshop ever. For these guys, delivery date is clearly just a way of attracting customers. Absolute unprofessional. | Very poor services. | Zobrazit v 3D prostoru nefunguje, píše chybovou hlášku: Nepodařilo se najít aplikaci pro otevření | Nice | A lot of times error: something gone wrong | Nejlepší česká appka | Very easy to use, the UI behaves as expected. Well done. | Aplikácia nepoužiteľné s dark módom a nedá sa to ani vypnúť | ""login failed"" messages, crashing and somehow working worse then it's web version. When it's working it's ok app... | v novem tmavem rezimu je pozadi vyhledavace i pismo cerne.... trochu neprakticke nevidet co pisu 😂👌 | Not the best thw black theme is not uniforn and the performwnce could be much better but overall alza as a company is cool i can buy everything | can't pay online in the app | Szedettvetett banda! Lassan 2 hete, hogy felhivtam oket lemondani egy ertekesebb arut. Azt mondtak mar uton van, csak ne vegyem at. 3 napja felhivom oket, hogy hol a penz. Az ugyfelszolgalatos szerint nem erkezett az aru a raktarba, de masnap majd kuld emailt, hogy mi van. Persze nem kuldott! Ma megint felhivom a ""megnezem a rendszerben"" teljesen magatehetetlen ugyfelszolgalatot. Hat megnezte a rendszerben es az elozovel ellentetben mar idopontot sem kamuzott be, hogy mikor meltoztatnak keresni | Very laggy, unable to use. Cart is unresponsive | Have you even opened the app yourself? White text on gray background? Pathetic... | Posledních pár měsíců je aplikace nepoužitelná. Neustále mne odhlašuje a 2FA lze pouze přes smsku. Nerozumím, proč si aplikace nepamatuje uživatelské jméno a nelze se přihlašovat biometricky. | Easy to use. Easy navigation, precise search, fast loading, nice interface. Products have such great category/ subcategories overview that I am always finding what I need. I love ""save for later"" option, and making my own folders for things I am often buying. I am using Alza app for almost everything I need for my family, home, car.. There is also good description of products. | I am trying to choose Hungary as shipping country but it says error so I cannot use the app at all. | App doesn't work. Search results are always blank | Best Shopping app on the market | Zrušil jsem dva dny zpožděnou objednávku. Objevilo se potvrzení, že objednávka je zrušena. Za hodinu mi přišel mail, že má objednávka přijde o něco dříve. Otevřel jsem aplikaci a hle: objednávka zrušena není a běží dál. To zavání nekalostí, že? Zrušil jsem znovu, uvidíme... Aplikace (a vlastně celý obchod) se snaží vnutit člověku rozbalené zboží (za které občas vydáváte i zboží značně používané). Nativně spouští spoustu otravných notifikací a má sklony neustále běžet na pozadí... Celkem děs. | App itself is fine however the dark mode has a split personality. Sometimes you get light mode, sometimes dark, sometimes both at once which is a problem because you get a white background with a white dark mode text so it's unreadable. I would suggest fixing the dark mode or at least make an option to choose between light and dark modes. | Quick and Great service | In the name of al that is unholy, why have you pushed out a dark theme without proper testing? The filter menu is basically invisible, especially the sliders are unreadable (length of cables for example) come on people, you're a serious company! Don't you fire the person responsible for this, just kick them in the shin because I'm half thankful that you brought dark mode. Half, because it's half baked | No login option. Cant change color settings. I was standing front of the Alza Box to get my order. I can't login my account. Can't pay my order because the Alza Box pin terminal was death such this app | Pro Alzu funguje App dobre. Ale uplne jste se vykaslali na dodatkove moznosti prepravy, ktere delate. Aukro mi poslalo zasilku pres Zasilkovnu, ale do AlzaBoxu. Indikace v jejich App byla silne nekonsistentni a jen se zobrazilo Heslo. Ale nebylo jasne, co se s nim ma delat! U nas stoji oba 2 ty boxy vedle sebe. Pritom by stacilo, kdyby App Alza laskave zasilku registrovala, a rekla, ze zde mam i vec ze Zasilkovny. Stal jsem tam 30min, zkousel ruzne metody a Googlil jsem, ale pak musel jit domu. | S22 Ultra, Android 12: I get a lot of black artifacts in product pages in dark mode. I'm unable to see text and sometimes it's just pure black page. You'd might to look into that. | Poor performance, plus currently due to unfortunate choice color theme (unable to modify on the user side) titles and texts are barely readable (gray text on white tiles). Problem report submitted, eager to get fix and increase rating afterwards. *EDIT: Black theme problem solved, thanks devs for the fast response ♥️. Rating updated. | Non functional | Aplikace funguje, ale má spoustu chyb. | Vůbec se nejde přihlásit do aplikace. Třikrát jsem měnila heslo a pořád to nejde. Přes web se normálně přihlašuji. | The white font with white backgrounds does not really work together in dark mode. I also cannot find where to change the dark mode in the app. | unusable in dark mode | Ok | Nemůžu se přihlásit. Na webu stejné přihlašovací údaje fungují bez problémů. | Easy to use-very user friendly, with great features. | Náhodné odhlasovanie, nemožnosť uložiť preferencie (napr vyhľadávať len nový tovar skladom), dodacie termíny nikdy neplatia | Aplikace mě neustále odhlašuje. Na desktopu, což je v principu mnohem méně bezpečné zařízení, mužů zůstat přihlášený klidně rok, ale aplikace mě odhlásí každých pár dnů. Dřív fungovala dobře, teď je míň otravné dojít k desktopu, než se znovu přihlašovat. Zkoušel jsem aplikaci resetovat, ale nepomohlo to; asi se jedná o nový ""feature."" | Worst service , app shows next day delivery but it take more than 4 days to get delivered , trying to cheat customer by showing worng delivery date and make us order the product. I have ordered apple watch as birthday gift they assured next delivery but I didn't receive it next day so i check with customer support and they told to wait one more day still i didn't receive so again I contacted the customer support at last they said unfortunately we can't deliver it soon . | But axe is weapon | Installed for one reason, to open alzaboxes by QR code.

However, it is reinstalled several times. I also contacted the IT deptartment with shaking my device. No answer so far. Finally they contacted me, and solved the problem remotly. Now it is working perfectly. | Text je prakticky necitatelny v tmavom rezime. | Po poslednom update neustále odhlasuje. Zakaždým login nanovo + 2FA.. Veľmi otravné naozaj. | nakup za 8k a vy jako uctujete jeste prachy navic za tasku, jako fakt????? vy jste ale lakomy, alza klesla hluboko v mych oci | V poslední verzi při rolování výrobků aplikace neskutečně laguje. Mám 120Hz displej, ale vypadá to tak na 5-10 snímků za sekundu. | Really useless app. I can't select Google Pay (it just don't do anything after clicking) and I also haven't been able to find functionality for less waiting during order pickup. Thank you for wasting my time. | Nabizeji porad neco navic, ukazuji doruceni zitra od a pri potvrzeni a zaplaceni objednavky se ukaze ze to bude az za 5 dni. Bida | Skvělé, díky, Vaše doporučení pomohlo odstranit problém s přihlášením → Nelze se přihlásit do aplikace. Tapnu na Přihlásit se a za pár vteřin se objeví ""Přihlášení se nezdařilo"". Spinner se dál točí, ale už se nic nestane (nechal jsem běžet na pozadí 5+ minut. Reinstalace nepomohla. Android 11, Google Pixel 2. Děkuji. | Works perfectly | už to jede, hurá.. | Useful app. App sucks in handling dark mode! | Aplikace mě brutálně naštvala. Po poslední aktualizaci se nemůžu přihlásit. Samozřejmě to můžu udělat přes prohlížeč. Jenže je mně to k ničemu, jelikož funkce rychlého vyzvednutí tam není. Update: Omlouvám se za své nervy. Bohužel, po poslední aktualizaci se stále nemůžu přihlásit. | Easy to use and friendly customer service. | Fajn ze sa da preskocit cez apku rad, ale na nakupovanie je nanic - vkuse len nacitava, nacitava a nic, alebo napise ""nieco sa pokazilo"", k tovaru sa dostanem noekedy az na piaty pokus po dlhom case. Davam uninstall, lebo na mobile si ani nedokazem cez to nic kupit. Velakrat radsej pozrem nrjaky iny eshop. | no bitcoin BCH payment option :( | Pravidelne sa mi stáva že si objednám nový tovar a pošlú mi použitý, za čo si potom doplácam? Keď som sa na cestrale rozprával s viacerými zákazníkmi potvrdili mi rovnakú skúsenosť. Musi to byť u nich zvyk keďže nie je možné aby to robili náhodou pravidelne. | Pravidelne sa pri nacitani produktu ""nieco pokazilo"" a potom uz nejde nacitat vobec nic. | Egész jó kis app, mondjuk egyszer duplán adott le egy 350000 forint körüli rendelést, de vissza lehet vonni :) Lehet venni találni mindent ami PC és az árak is elég jók, ki is hozzák. | Na žádným z mých zařízení nefunguje přihlášení | All the time problem with log in.. Once I am in its logging me out.. when I tried again its saying log in failed. I can see so many people got same problem. Instead writing we don't have enough info start doing something about it! | Impossible to file warranty claims, the app slows down and does not allow you to select an Alza branch. On the positive side, they support English language. | Good app. | často mrzne | Best E-commerce app ever. Very little bugs. Good job. | Logged out. Can't login at all. Keeps saying login failed. Tried so many times. Uninstalled and reinstalled application many times. | V Appke sa nedá prihlásiť cez gmail | Easy to use | The sipping was late, like 2 month late,the box was beaten up | Nefunguje vam appka uz asi tyzden ked si kliknem na konkretny produkt | Its freezing | Celkově méně přehledné a pomalejší než web a to i na S8 Ultra a rychlém připojení. Navíc Alza není schopná doručit zboží na adresu za méně než 3 dny. Stálo by za to se zamyslet a zkusit se posunout do 21 století. | Občas tam blbne keyboard layering při zadávání autorizačního kódu z SMS, jinak všechny funkce fungují tak, jak mají. Jen tak dál. | Amazing app and amazing customer service. Dark mode missing on both app and website. | Najlepšie a najjednoduchšie vyhľadávanie tovaru. Detaily a technické parametre tovaru.

Other apps usually allow you to create new products. | Very ugly, non-intuitive and clogged interface! Extremely annoying ""ad"" to buy the premium version. Doesn't show summary of the meals per day. The only really useful thing is the rich DB with lots of local (CZ) products and meals. That DB added 1 star to my review.

And I saw that in past, there wasn't a premium banner, and now there is. Shame | Toto BOLA najlepšia aplikácia svojho druhu. To čo sa s ňou v poslednej dobe stalo je naozaj smutné. Reklamy chápem, ale v tomto prípade je to absolútne prehnané. O čo viac pridali reklám o to viac aplikácia blbne, je plná bugov a nefunguje ako má. Zaspamovať aplikáciu reklamami a pýtať od ľudí peniaze za prémium za aplikáciu, ktorá je v takomto stave mi príde až drzé.

Akorát, že reklamy jsou mnohem méně otravné než vaše oznámení, ještě navíc s rakovinou, jakou jsou emotikony. Aplikace při spouštění často padá. | Why is it only in Czech? | Disturbing ads | Asi si najdu něco jiného upřímně. Reklama doslova blokuje celou stránku. Ne děkuji | In theory this app is very good. In praxis not so much. I am perfectly fine with ads (devs need to eat too, go premium to remove them) but it's unfortunate that adding HUGE push for premium that covers half of the screen gets higher prio than separating apps language from system default (not supperted languages=cz). You can still do it via phone language settings in app languages section (slk, hun, pol, etc) but it's annoying you need to. Calorie part of the app 4*, user interface part 1* | Jestli si myslite, ze si koupim predplatny jen kvuli ty ""otravny reklame"", jak sami rikate, tak ne, presne kvuli tomu si ho nekoupim. | Why is it not possible to change the language?

Neustále se teď zobrazuje reklama na premium, která je naprosto obstrukční a nejde přes ní vidět ani co zapisuji.. pardon jako nebudu váš rukojmí vy mamlasove, to si radši najdu něco jiného. Navíc ještě s těmi odpornými smajlíky. Nehledě na to že jsem premium měl nejednou, a teď když ho náhodou nemám, tak mě to otravuje permanentně. Reklama v nějakém banneru nahoře nebo dole budiž ale tohle je na zbliti. | Už pár měsíců aplikace při každém spuštění spadne. Nutno spouštět dvakrát. Nyní přibyla otravná reklama na premium přes půlku displeje. | Can you just remove the huge ""buy premium"" banner that takes LITERALLY half of both the main screens? I would consider buying it after a few weeks of usage if I'm satisfied, but this way the app is almost unusable when I have to scroll to see anything meaningful. It's a shame, otherwise looks promising. | V aplikacii neexistuju nastavenia jazyka, aplikacia takisto z nejakeho dovodu neobsahuje niektore potraviny a jedla, ktore na strankach su....ozaj tomu nerozumiem | App is great but current state with non removable add to get premium is so annoying - blocking half of the screen. Add at least button to remove offer if one doesnt want it. So bad and invasive. | After the last update, I suppose, a language of product is automatically changing to Czech after adding to a list. Also, it is always resetting to the top of list after adding a product. | Language problems , ""my meals"" doesn't work , also gives an exaption when I try to edit the daily food. Also I emailed the support , all they could say is to reinstall the app or change my phone language which didn't hel at all , also broken translation not visible in web version at all | App is only in Czech language despite being used in Slovakia. ""My meals"" don't work in the app. Everything, however, works in website interface so I really don't understand why the app can not work the same. I can't even change the app language! Really, no point of using this app as it only frustrates you enough to log into the website anyway. | Become unusable. Cannot add custom food. Language setting works only from start. After reinstalling can't login. Switched to simple link to web app on mobile. Works much more stable | Good application | Great way of tracking my eating habits | We have premium subscription. I always have issues with the language. Despite I have set up the app in Ukrainian it always has Czech language when I browse through some sections of the menu. It is very frustrating, as I can not add any meal then, doesn't fing anything.

However, I lack improvements, transparent changelogs and some vision. For invested money I would like to see something more than only maintainance. | 🌮🍲🤞💪🤸👍🙋🏽‍♂️ | App several times a day switched to Czech language, helps only restart. Android 11, system language is English, app language is Ukrainian. | Я из России, но у меня почему-то приложение отображается на казахстком. При этом в самом приложении я не могу поменять язык на русский или английский. Update: Ребята связались и помогли исправить ситуацию. Отличная тех.поддржка, спасибо 💪🏻 | This app is the starter pack for an eating disorder. | Apku jsem používal před několika lety. Byla super. Teď jsem ji chtěl zase používat, ale... Otevírání aplikace je pomale, přihlášení je na několik pokusu. Vyhledání potraviny je také pomalé, ne vždy se podaří na první pokus. Používám android one na Nokia 4.2. | After years the app is getting bloated and databse declines. Now theyintroduce meaningless.notifications that pop up. | Really helpful app. Easy to use for tracking your meals. Few bugs (like searching food in database - it doesn't work properly) and few features might be more UI friendly (copying meals, adding your own meals). But I lost weight. So I guess it works :) I consider updating to the full paid version. | Что с языком?

Reklamy cez celu obrazovku, ktore vam bloknu mobil na 5 sekund!!! (v tomto smere najhorsia appka aku som kedy mal). Reklamy sa daju vypnut kupou premium, ale to by museli mat dostatok potravin v databaze aby to vobec davalo zmysel. 1* za peknu grafiku a 1* za rychlo reagujuci support aj cez vikend, mile prekvapenie. | Колись була суперова програма.

Начал использовать, и сразу споткнулся об баги локализации, изменил язык в настройках приложения, только после смены системных настроек.

I've searched for ""таблиця калорійності"" in Play Store and only version I could find was... Czech one (obvious, right?) 3.

I finally have the Ukrainian version and the app itself is awesome! The process of getting it not so much:) | Cesky, prehledne, skenovani kodu, zatim super, predchozi padani opraveno | I'd like this app. but when I changed my phone language from Russian to English app's language changer to another and I don't know how to return app's language to russian | Super appka, od ciela ma deli uz iba 1 kg ! | Nelze nic vytknout.

It's in English. | Dobrá aplikace ale opravdu mi vadí, že si nemůžu sama vytvářet a upravovat kategorie pro výdaje - některé jsou pro mě naprosto nerelevantní a naopak na největší část svých výdajů kategorii nemám. | Aplikace neustále otravuje reklamou na různé půjčky a zvažuju, že přejdu s účtem jinam.

The review is for the bank itself. Bank include hidden in requested "" services"" and keep charging you for those "" services"", even though you never ask for it. You need basically to monitor manually your account everyday to check if they are stealing your money.

Vyčištěte prosím konečně UX přehledu plateb. Zahraniční platby jsou absolutní mess, kde je mám najít, jejich historie, zadávání, uložené účty, templates, v základním přehledu není ani IBAN na který jsem tu platbu poslal!! Nechápu, proč v eurovém účtu vůbec rozlišujete v seznamu zahraniční a domácí platby, každá informace mě stojí o pět kliků víc než je zapotřebí.

Thinking of going to a different bank | This is rubbish I am not in Czech Republic, I had to replace my phone because my old phone broke. Instead the app and now it's asking me for client number.

Equa bank mobile banking app tohle uměla. | Pořád nějaká odstávka. Bankovnictví každou chvíli nefunguje. Jakmile mně doběhne hypotéka, účet zruším. | While the graphic overview of spendings looks nice, it's unusable: I'd love to see my incomes and spendings WITHOUT transfers to and from my savings account. Or even better: an overview of spendings on all accounts combined | Still operates in Russia | The app is cluttered, counter-intuitive, with lots of spam (so-called ""offers"" form the bank, which cannot be turned off), repaying credit card does not update the amount left to pay (so even if you repaid the whole amount - the app would still show that you owe the full amount to the bank), etc. And I am not even saying anything about the overall bank approach towards the clients... | Very good banking system and great experience with this bank | Horrible. You've randomly made the app start looking for root and have locked me out of the app in the name of ""safety"". Even after tricking your app so that it can't see that i'm rooted, I can't even re-activate myself because I don't have an EU ID card, as I am a foreigner. So now I have to stop by one of your branches, but it's evening now. No banking for me till tomorrow, I guess.

To me the only missing feature is the easy copy function | good service | Their banking services are a disaster, so I'm uninstalling this app... | The self-service activation process is missing a key scenario: reinstalled on the same device (eg., when the latest release is worse than the previous one). New device activations from the online web portal were disabled. Unless you already have a 2nd active instance on another device, you're out of luck. | As a Gen Z customer, the app is very accessible and intuitive.

Keeps telling me to check my internet connection but I'm on WiFi and everything else works. Please fix it as I can't even reach out to support. Thanks. | They didn't leave Russia and the app sucks, Equa Bank app was WAY BETTER. | too many maintenance days where the app is unusable. | Edit my review, as the initial inability to activate it via internet banking has now been worked around by RB by adding the ability to activate via RB klíč app (that has been forced upon everyone before). It's an okay banking app, but it has no useful features comparing to web banking (and thus superfluous): no push notifications on card transactions and account charges, for example (and e-mail ones are still range from barely useful to useless in the case of non-CZK currency charges). | I have good experience with this bank. I have had many banking experiences in DK/N/ČR and this bank is worth the fees. As any bank, also R has to live from our relationship, - which means they make my money work for ME in a way which is also profitable for R. so yes, definitely worth the fees. | Zero udser friendliness | Nelze vytvořit virtuální kartu, ale je nutné mít fyzicky plastovou. Proč? | Aplikace neustále nabízí obchodní nabídky, nejdou vypnout. Grafický přehled utrácení neumožňuje hromadné označování výdajů, nepamatuje si to podniky a trvalé platby, je v podstatě k ničemu | Přehledná a jednoduchá na používání. | Mohli by jste dát auto filtr? Aby se transakcím automaticky dávali kategorie . | Great app very convenient | Veškeré změny, týkající se klasických i trvalých plateb musíte provést několikrát a stane tím pádem, že dojde k nevědomému provedení platby. To samé se děje u analýzy výdajů a zařazování do jednotlivých kategorií. Přidal bych také analýzu příjmů a možnost vyřadit převod peněz ze spořícího účtu na klasický z příjmů. Po vyřešení těchto problémů nemám problém dát 5* | I'm a client of RB for over 12 years and during the same time using at least 3 other other banks in CZ. RB annoyingly keeps updating their app every month or so but it keeps just getting worse and worse. Difficult, unintuitive, crowded simply put: a mess (The website is even worse) All other banks I use have simple straight forward interfaces. Equa's was excellent till RB swallowed them Unfortunately they learned nothing from it. What a shame.. | Nová funkce evidence digitálních peněženek a uložení karty na různých webech je skvělá. Tohle se vám vážně povedlo. The new feature of digital wallet overview and card records on various sites is great. You guys really did a great job with this. | Aktivně vás nutí do nevýhodných produktů + při splátce kreditky trvá i den, než se zas navýší limit (nepochopitelný) | Velmi nedbale napsaná aplikace. Značné datové nároky, zcela mimo rámec mobilní komunikace. Neošetřené vstupy, hrůza. Zvažuji uninstall a zrušení účtu, tohle ani jako hloupý vtip. V porovnání s předchozí svižnou aplikací nebe a dudy. | egua bank app was much better | Great, easy to navigate with some good features. | one of the best bank in Czech Republic, and the most stressfree in Europe | Edit: I set it to the smallest level ""No notifications"" and right in the next login another offer of some insurance. Always nags with unwanted offers. You cannot open the app without getting them. Loans, mortages, credit cards, unwanted app functions. Extremely annoying. | Jakákoliv bankovní aplikace, do které se přihlašuje pouze číselným pinem, je bezpečnostní odpad. Otisk prstu nic neznamená, když na pozadí je pouze číselný PIN. Jak je možné, že si tohle mohou banky dovolit (RB není bohužel jediná)? | This bank randomly closes bank accounts to it's clients without any explanation. | The app isn't only unintuitive to use, it's riddled with annoying ad widgets and popups that lead to another popups asking you why you don't like their popups. NO I DON'T WANT ANY LOAN REIFFEISEN. Makes you miss Equabank app and consider switching for good. | In general de app is good, however it keeps asking if I want to borrow money, putting a misleading button in the first screen. Another problem is the RB Club, why to ask for discount at the store? Few times happened that the store didn't know they have a program with RB club and did not provide the discount. Best is to return the money automatically when the purchase happens in the places that are part of the program. This os how it works in Moneta and Ceska Spořitelna, much better! | Indeed, best bank ever. I confirm | Koně nemám rád :* | Slozity a nefunkcni overovaci system. Netusil jsem ze kdyz aplikaci odinstaluju a nainstaluju protoze mi prestala fungovat, nelze se do ni jednodusse znovu prihlasit. Ani pres web se do internetoveho bankovnictvi nedostanu. Je nutne nainstalovat dalsi aplikaci pro overeni dokumentu, ta ale bohuzel nefunguje a dokumenty se proste nenahraji. Takze jsem tedy ted vecer zustal bez pristupu na ucet... | My debit card's wireless usually stops working after 6-7 months, so I have replaced 2 cards already. In the Block Card reason there is only STOLEN or LOST. I would suggest to add NOT WORKING so that it's clear why the card was blocked and replaced. | ID scanning not functional | The application nor your website (rb.cz) are working properly. I am unable to login and as a result cannot send payments out that are necessary for me to do. | Mezi vsemi bankovnimi aplikacemi tahle vynika nejvetsi otravnosti. Jak aplikace, tak IB od Raifky je spis reklamni portal na vsechny jejich zbytecne produkty. Miziva optimalizace UX. Kdyz vypnete zobrazovani reklamnich nabidek, za cas se zase aktivuje zobrazovani = nejste panem vlastni aplikace na vlastnim telefonu. Horsi pristup tezko pohledat. A to si rikaji klientsky nejprivetivejsi banka. Cekam, kdy mi zacnou nabizet stiraci losy. | Aplikace přestala posílat notifikace z plateb. Ano, sama od sebe, vše mám povolené. | Proč je to tak nepříjemné? Aplikace otravuje pořád s něčím. Edit: děkuji, Kláro, to je přesně ten problém, že to jde skrýt jenom dočasně a že každé otevření aplikace s něčím prudí, I když mám všechno ""vypnuté"" :( | nice and fantastic bank | Spam v notifikacích na půjčky, v rámci pohybů, zaslané zprávy v rámci aplikace, SMS ... To opravdu ne. Banner nahoře s nabídkami mi nevadí, ale jiný invazivní reklamy jsou hrozné. Mám více bank a tam takhle agresivní vnucování v aplikaci nevidím ... S RB jsem od akvizice Citi a bohužel začínám uvažovat o změně mého hlavního bankovního účtu. Edit: ani po 3 letech žádná změna a nabídky opravdu nejdou vypnout (mluvím o těch při startu aplikace) | not working user id... | the best bank app out there | Since RB took over Equa, I've been disappointed. The app is not intuitive, there is no easy way to copy account number when you want to receive payment. Actually, receiving payment is hell. Where even is any option to copy your bank account number? You have to rewrite all the numbers manually as it was done 15 years ago. | easy and convenient | The app is just okay most of the time, but the UI is kind of cluttered and hard to navigate. They also show ads for their services and, if you hide those, they still pop up again after a while. The Equal Bank app was better when that still existed. | Absolutely sucks compared to Equa bank. They shouldn't have taken it over. It is always always down or inaccesible for maintenance | Originally this app was in both Czech and English. Several months ago it updated, now when I set the language to English, it's about 90% Ukrainian with some random English. Very difficult to do anything with my account. I have even had both Czech and Ukrainian friends they to help with no luck. | Banking trash that covers pedophiles and ruined the economy deliberately | ceska | Nefunkční QR Payment pro pdf | After yesterday's update the app keeps crashing. Reinstall didn't help either. | Horrible experience. If you get locked out of your account, you need to go to one of their branches for them to allow you to use the application again. It's funny how you might need to use a public computer or network to login to your account via browser. But you can't re activate your app for ""security"" reasons. Yeah it can happen during vacations. Great idea. This is crazy. | Obchodní nabídky jsou otravné, nespletli jste si účel aplikace? Mám nastaveno na minimum a stejně každý den vyskočí nerelevantní nabídka | I přes zrušení souhlasu s marketingovými nabídkami mi stále nabízení po zapnutí aplikace nějaké služby a nabídky, které mě nezajímají. Reiffeisen není banka, ale spam. Budu si hledat jinou banku | Zlodeji! Zrusil jsem cestivni pojištění pres app 2x a stale je mi uctovano. Přítelkyně to same. Jako puvodni klient Equa je mi z RB fakt zle, sama past, jak na minovem poli. | nice | Internetove bankovnictvi otravuje na prvnim miste s uctem ktery byl u banky pred prevodem sekundarni, a nijak nereaguje na hvezdicku ""nezobrazovat jako preferovany"", nelze ucet nijak schovat/odsunout. Ucet se vtira jako prvni volba do vsech plateb a jelikoz je eurovy, hrozi extra poplatky za prevody | You are very good showing me offers but not having a usable gui where you can delete the templates. You also cannot copy accounts details from transfers or copy in general. Prinscreens are not allowed. Why do you have 1 payment button under the account tab and one at the bottom but the back button doesn't take me to the main page? Hire a UI/UX expert please. | I'm fully satisfied with this application. | Good and functional app. I'm a client almost for 5 years. | Not responding, kindly share the email to send you the screenshot of the issue | very 👍good | Not very intuitive, the phone back button doesn't work in the app, when I changed description of a standing order, it duplicated the payment. It could and should be better, this is not some startup challenger bank. Lovely response in the spirit of ""the problem you are experiencing doesn't exist"". | Bank is useless, can't open account as EU citizen. I could do that with equa before. Trash being a EU citizen with legal residence in another country is legal residence permit in Czechia. Other banks let you open an account and it is EU regulations that you are infringing. | Děsná aplikace, člověk se musí proklikat hromadami reklam na jejich produkty nez se dostane na obrazovku, kde jsou kromě mnou hledanych informaci další várka reklam. Ty se dají zakázat ale jen na chvilku. V prvé řadě jde o reklamy. Škoda té EquaBank, kež by oni koupili Rajfku a zařízli jí, stejne jak to udelala Rajfka s EB. Produkty stojí za prd a ještě je musím 50x denně odkliknout že nemám záhem. Si myslíte, že si to jednoho dne rozmyslím nebo že mně reklamními bloky udoláte? | equabank byla mnohem lepší nevyžádaná změna | Top notch service and security | It is very unfriendly to hide the category of future payments under the History button, together with all regular payments. Instead of History, it should be called All Payments, because it is a mix of future and past and of one-times-only orders with recurring orders, too. | 🤗 | Ten blbec čo vám navrhuje procesy by mal byť prepustený a zadusený poučkou o základoch GUI. Absolútne neintuitivne ovládanie. Zlé cesty k službám. Posielať SMS s reklamami, blokujúce popupy, že ste zmenili farbu... musel vymyslieť niekto kto UX nikdy nenavrhoval. NEBLOKUJÚCE OZNÁMENIE O ÚDRŽBE JE NEPRÍPUSTNÉ!!!!!!! | Excellent | aplikace je hrozně pomalá | I don't have the account anymore. I deinstslled it but still it proposes to update. What the hell | There are a lot of features to navigate. But it does everything you want it to, smoothly and without hassle. | Nice app, works fine | This app is useless. Constant crashes and infinite loading. When you need to use app urgently it fails to work. I have tried all possible solutions from my end, none have worked. Absolute utter rubbish. Wouldn't recommend. | it cannot increase font size | QR payments don't work. Says the qr code is invalid but it works in other apps. | I am very unhappy with the app. Whenever I want to make a new payment, it just switches itself off. | BE CAREFFUL WITH SAVING ACCOUNT OF RAIFFEISEN BANK, IT IS A SCAM. STEALING MONEY OF KLIENT BY A LOT OF REASONS... BIG BRAND BUT CHEAP SERVIS! | Snažil jsem se znovu aktivovat svůj účet, neúspěšně. Napíše mi to, že musím použít RB klíč aplikaci kde když všechno provedu, tak se nic nestane a v internetovém bankovnictví mi to napíše že RB klíč již nelze používat. Když to zkusím přes internetové bankovnictví, tak mi to napíše že přes internetové bankovnictví už to taky nejde aktivovat. Tudíž tuto aplikaci vlastně nejde aktivovat/používat. | good | vše ok. Dobře udělaná aplikace k účtům | Nefunguje na Pixel 6 | Oproti equa aplikaci je tato velmi pomalá. | doesnt lanuch on WSA | Jini pomerne zvladli prechody mezi přihlášením, odhlášením a klicem. Jini ale hure. Zde nižší prumer. Ovsem conveniently nefunkcni tlacitko zpět je moc hezky pocin. 😉 🙂 | Compared to Equa bank app, but also to mBank one, this Reiffeisen one is the most counter-intuitive banking app I've seen. Base functionalities like SEPA payments or standing orders are really painful. Push notifications are duplicated (for card payments: first blocked, than debited) which is quite annoying. Please fire your UX designer and find a better one. I'd say whoever designed Equa app could be a good candidate. Edit: OMG, it's not even possible to change your PIN in the app 🤦‍♀️ | Velice zakladni aplikace/ zadne moderni funkce (v. Karta, vlastni investice, jednorazove karty....) + 2-4 do tydne nejde spustit!!! | App is not able to download data and fails to load the loading screen... very annoying... | Great application with all necessary features. Please add an instant one-time virtual card for online shopping. | App is ok but I would add the total amount of money present in the account next to every movement in the list, as a reference for the user in keep tracking of ins and outs | I am not receiving any notifications ever, even tho my settings are correct. The app itself is not cool at all. | The administration of this bank is corrupt and racist towards foreigners. Case example, EquaBank opened accounts for the incoming students.. now they have taken over the bank and don't approve the accounts. | never works why u need it | overall this app is good enough for use of base features. the big disadvantage for me is that tech support periods take a lot of time. It's terrible because during this period you cannot do anything with your accounts online. for example, yesterday I couldn't transfer money between accounts while being in a grocery shop | I was moved from te equabank app and the raiffeisen app is a lot more unclear, especially around data on payments and notifications of payments that seem to arrive several days later. it has also been in maintenance mode during the day several times now.

I have an account on Notino since I was living in Romania and the app/website keep switching me to the romanian page and doesn't let me sign into the italian page or create an account with the same email address. The only option is to shop as guest which I don't want because I want to keep track of my orders and favourite products. You might wanna take feedback in consideration and fix the issues.. | could do with an English language option ;) | Non funziona | perfect | Good service. | I can't log in to my account and it's really annoying. It's been more than a month and the issue is not fixed yet. The log in button redirects me to results on enquiries about authorisation endpoints, Open ID and other stuff.

I didnt get any free parfume samples. Next time I will order elsewhere. | love it | I'm satisfied with the service | excellent choice of products at very attractive prices and the discounts are the best . Great value for money | Good place to buy fragrances. Much cheaper than outlets and get regular sales. | Won't let me add items to my cart and won't let me sign in or create an account, just redirects to non working links. | They charged me 540 EUR and haven't delivered the product or returned my money. I am now trying to get my money back with Google Pay. Don't risk buying anything expensive on Notino. | I've been using Notino for a long time - vide choice and good prices. HOWEVER your language settings are trash. Unlike other, better designed websites and apps, none of the versions of notino.ch let you use any language but German. Switzerland has 4 official languages (German, French, Italian, Romansh.) Most of sites include 3 of those. I don't speak German.

LOST CHF 200!!!!!! I ordered online on Dec 5, 2023. I received an empty box. I contacted the customer service when I received the box (all proof recorded). I sent them the photos and videos of the box. I asked them to find me a solution. They're not responding to me with a proper solution. I paid an insurance upon purchasing from their website. That is apparently another waste of money. A piece of advice: do not waste your money on their website / app. You won't receive your items. | O aplicatie foarte utila, intuitivă și ai extra discount dacă comanzi direct din ea. | Absolutely love to shop on this page 😍 | Good app! Great products I recommend. | 👍 | great prices and a very easy ordering experience. I love Notino! | easy to order | Get perfume at bargain price recommend. | the app is fine. the problem is that it is only in Hungarian. You have already developed the same app in English, why not add the option to choose the language regardless of the location? | top company, well recommended | love the price of fragrances you can almost always choose the bottle size | Great offers on some but can get others cheaper elsewhere. Also, not sure if this is due to the app but there isn't a 'pay by Klarna/clearpay' option?... That would've helped:/ | Great selection of perfumes. Always prompt delivery. | Avoid at all cost unless you are a linguist. | Works seamlessly. Really impressed, compared to whatever on earth Superdrugs and Boots apps are doing. | fantastic company, great prices! | Fabulous selection of fragrances at fantastic bargain prices. | I can't add a single product to my cart. It keeps saying ""an error occured"", yet when I check my inbox on browser I have all the products in my cart that I was trying to add in the app. I'm extremely disappointed and will uninstall the app and I will never try to use it again. | Login and checkout are redirected to non-working links.

Spent a week telling them one item is missing in the package only for them to realise a week later it was their mistake and that they didn't pack it in the first place. | good quality items,reasonable prices | Great service | Excellent place to shop | Brilliant😁 | 5 razy probowalam zamowic. slaba aplikacja! | great prices | Terrible apple. It's in a weird language and made my device glitch. I deleted it immediately | A good company | Great App | Very good app. Nice price and great choice. Thank you so much. | Love it. | Awesome 👌🏼 | I was forced to install in order to use a voucher I received. There, you had my usership for 2 minutes. I hope your pushy marketing team is happy but I will remain annoyed at you. I don't reccomend this seller with dark patterns. | so far so good! thank you! | give an option for expats in prague to change language to English!! | perfect stock, prices and delivery. | App showing information in czech language. How to change it to english? | courier expenses are too high | great shop on line with fantastic offers !!! | not able to sign in. it is redirecting me to notino online page | give options in English too for language selection | Country and language should be very different. Not everyone living in a country speaks the language there. Fix this please | no free delivery as stated on site | Very good service, really competitive prices | although I use the app constantly with no problems, I wanted to order Most wanted 50ml for 52€(with the 20% off). At But when go to payment, the regular price is 72€ instead of 65€ and after discount it's 59 instead of 55 so? | Filters are not working very well. The product list in the browser has a longer summary which allows you to see the exact product without needing to open the product. This is useful when choosing from a variety of face creams. However this is not the case in the app. | Love Notino, needs more K-brands | Very good and friendly service ! | Kiváló fodrász | Extremely useful service - fast selecting and ordering; high-quality images of the products; huge list of possible choices. | Pacat ca nu lucreaza cu card cadou | love it easy and fast | it great Nd better sale price | Great stuff always | They accept PayPal on their website but not on the app. Ridiculous. | Dark Theme | THE BEST✌️👍👏 | super | first tried notino 2 years ago and haven't looked back.

Not to mention that there should always be English option. At this moment this app is useless for me, whish is too bad because I love to shop at notino.ch. | Great prices | Обожнюю цей магазин!

After I sign in, it shows I left something in the basket but as soon as I click to see what it is, everything is wiped clean and I'm logged out. This happened 3x in a row, annoying. | The app keeps logging me out, so I've lost everything that was in my basket. | Notino has an outstanding value proposition that, in my opinion, sets them above the rest. They have a comprehensive selection of brands. The entire delivery experience is effortless and without issue. I would highly recommend them. 10/10👏 | good price and fast delivery | very easy app to use. | Servire si retur impecabile, unele produse nu sunt asa bune. Marile branduri sunt insa bestiale. | A reliable store in terms of customer support, payment, and real discounts. | App is not functional for the last few days. It is simply not loading, so it is useless. | This app is one of the worst I've tried. There's products that are at a way better price with the app voucher, BUT unfortunately, buying is not possible. So this app is totally useless. | excellent service, highly recommended, vat choice for gifts | Best store to order cosmetics and perfumes from, app works smoothly too | I like the app, works fine. Offering wide range of products. Delivery could be faster, one-day delivery instead of 2-3 days. Product reviews are mostly accurate, except the ones where companies like L'Oréal buying the reviews. This I can figure out from the review tags where it's added ""free gifts"". Those are usually fake reviews but at least they don't hide this information. | jò az app! :) de az àrak nèha kedvezőbbek a viszont eladònàl.

Simply ridiculous."",""The app does great work, but I paid for it weekly for two months, and it would not let me use ANY of my premium features. It would just ask me to purchase premium.

Please make the app be able to change icon color when users apply color palette to app icons. | Terrible customer service! Biggy app. The whole day spent in writing e-mails to customer support who cannot sum two simple digits. | please allow english language choice, we don't all live in places where we speak the local language.

Maybe next is zalando lounge? | Finally, I can use it in English! It took you 3 years, but still great to see this important improvement! | Excellent returns process, refunded very quickly. | Should have a language option no ONLY a region option. Sometimes English speakers live in a non-English speaking country and visa versa. Edit: they added the option of having English in the app while in a non-English speaking region. 5 stars for listening to their customers! | Sinnlose App. Installiert - gelöscht.

Zalando was my favourite shopping app because of this particular filter and now it's gone. Just as the comments on the sellings, where are they? They used to be so helpful when it came to sizing and quality. And the favourites section could be better too - if one could make categories for the articles...

The item has not been given to the elivery company. Because its ""dispatched"" you cannot cancel. This is just a fake status as its soon a month since order. This is a big SCAM in my view...

Quite annoying regression bug. | they are the best out there zalando😇 | Very frustrating user experience | App is automatically logging u off every few days and changing language randomly | It has been so many years, but how come there is no option to change the app language. If you choose a country, the app only has the local language. Why not have it in English as well. For this particular reason, it is hard to develop any interest towards browsing products in the app. | No country. | App doesn't work for a few weeks now, always shows an Error Message and shuts down.

Makes it quite a pain to arrange alternative delivery. | C'est scandaleux que le seul moyen de paiement possible ce soit des virements bancaires, en 2024.. j'ai écrit et appelé le service client depuis des mois et ça ne marche toujours pas, on m'a demandé de me déconnecter de réinstaller l'application, y a rien qui marche.

Now Zalando lost it's advantage and the massive data on customer preferences / size indications. | Awesome | I'm sad that the reviews are gone! Because the reviews helped me! | Fun shopping experience but please set a mode where you can change the side of the shopping beta assistant. As a left handed person it's quite horrible to scroll with having the icon exactly where you want to scroll. Other than that, I'm very happy. Ordering and delivery always work out. The product range is insanely huge and everything is structured so you can get well around | The app is not opening just after it's installed, on Pixel7pro | Nice | excellent | Brands landing pages are very confusing, they are all designed and structured in a different way and it makes really hard to navigate for particular brand. Why they can't be all structured in the same manner, why bother to make individual landing? Very frustrating to be honest. | GOOD | Delivery was maybe a day or two late. Everything was as described. | I wanted to buy a pair of trainers and can't as the browser check gives an error message. | this app is so good and the clothes have good quality 👌 | Slovenia app doesn't offer English | I literally can't pay, I put the card info in, press next and then it just refreshes and deletes my info. | Please do something to stick with language choose by the user, everytime I open the app I need to change back to french ... | good app | Had a previous positive experience on Zalando with orders. Was aware of a price matching policy,so I contacted Zalando as they had a jacket I was interested in purchasing. Contacted their customer service and provided links to the reputable sites as they requested. Declined to match prices multiple times. Was speaking to an agent on an online chat,and they immediately ended the chat after declining!!! An abrupt response and then ends the chat.Extremely rude and unprofessional. | Great site | Good shop, customer service is top notch,high level of professionalism regarding making purchases and returns | I really appreciate | You can't find promotions only products with very small size or extremely big .such a mess | Great to have English as a language option in the App now. Makes it so much easier to shop. However app notifications are still in German. Size guides are also essential for a good shopping experience. | Top Angebote | good for buying, terrible for contacting customer service | good | Z niakeho dôvodu nemôžem posielať svoje zásielky na Zásielkovňu ale inak super | very good 👍 | The color selection is horrible. You click one color, and then the page refreshes, and it's at the beginning of the selection again, and you completely lose the overview! | As a man, I tended to stear clear from fashion apps because of the dominant useage of women,The thought process was that this app caters primarily toward women, Which makes sense business wise. But after trying out Lounge, I wanted to give regular Zalando a try. Was not disappointed, You see, I cannot buy regular shoes because I have flat feet from birth, Which sucks hard but that's life, Zalando is carrying models and makes that other physical stores don't have the wide option.Highly recommend | Won't convert from Spanish to English | No version for tablets ! | good 👍👍😊 | bad | The app is good,and I think the prices are right but if you live in Switzerland and of course you want to shop here,the app only let's you use it in German/French or Italian ,I don't speak neither of these but I would like the be able to select English as an option...that s why I will put 2 stars only,making the app pretty much useless Edit: this function has sience been added,I gave it 5 stars! Good job Zalando! 👏 | Not bad, but there is only the possibility to choose the country and not the language (I live abroad and I'm still learning the local language so I'd like to have the app in English regardless the country). Update: now that it has English as default language it's perfect for me! Thanks! | app is great, just please add english support for the Netherlands | bravo | Great service so far. The only downside is that they're using DHL express which is the worst of the bunch. | 👍 | Great stuff | It was so so | Très belle application malgré les inconvénients dans quelques options comme l'annulation, aucun fenêtre ou informations affichées pour nous disons que l'argent n'est pas retenu comment ça ? Vs prenez tt l'argent en annulation et sans confirmation avec note que rien n'était retenu même la 50% c'est pas logique | Why dont you add language changing option in the app. Or atleast add english language. | sehr active | Aferistai!!! brokuotų daug prekių ir negražina pinigų. | 😍 | So super 😍💙 | Second time to return an item however still have to pay for it . Customer service is very poor that I can't complain and get my money back | good | Orders just don't arrive and customer service is completely useless | nice | I didn't have good experience in Sweden. Fake items with fake prices, looks available but when you buy, you never get it... Deleted! | I always recieve my orders in time ...products are real good deal. | I want to commend your effort and sincerity I goth exactly ohw it was shown on the app ,God bless zalando.guys please buy from them. | English not supported app is very simple like it's recent startup. looks not reliable at all. | Why removing the customer reviews??!😭 you're website is beside that great! | Foarte buna | Great app.! | zalando is an amazing website and so useful 👌 | the best legit online shopping in the world | A bunch of text and spacing doesn't work well. The app would not allow me to add letters to my postal code (it gave me a numeric keyboard to type on) and then wouldn't accept any postal code without letters (which -again- it wouldn't let me enter). Had to go through the desktop website, which was even worse. | loyal interesting quality | Pretty good apps. | danke | I live in Sweden, but speak English. Where language selection? | I am using it for a many years,was very satisfied..but I don't get it why now it's impossible only that when I do order something then in check out says Only Pre Transfer (Bank) available...???... first you have to pay for a things then it's will be shipped out....🙄...as Invoice Isn't available...I always paid by PayPal...and ist not impossible anymore... Very disappointed... | is actually excellent. | Zeleris was meant to deliver my parcel from you, over a week and apparently multiple attempts to deliver (I was at home everyday) my package was lost. Merry Christmas! Never use Zalando | Exellent service!!! | Im very dissapointed the customer reviews of the articles were removed, they were extremely useful since sometimes people would give advice regarding true size/true color or share other characteristics that are not visible in the pictures or shared in the description of the article. Also the ""My favorites"" section is not the best because if you have a long list of favorites it is not posible to categorize them. For the rest the app works really good and service has always been good. | No customer service when I've needed. Hard to see what is paid and what isnt,specially after returning items in an order. | Took my money and the item, been waiting for 3 months to get my refund | Foarte buna iar reducerile sunt senzaționale | Garbage, no option to change language separately from country, so I can't use the app. Super basic thing to not have, not sure why | no dark mode | The app itself is fine enough. The support the company gives is pretty awful, to put it nicely. | Can't put in postcode for address because it brings up a number-omly keyboard when UK postcodes are alphanumeric. | v good | good","{""1"":29598,""2"":14150,""3"":41339,""4"":103750,""5"":911383}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Zalando SE","8409823038504844562","android@zalando.de","https://www.zalando.com",,"https://en.zalando.de/zalando-privacy-policy/","8409823038504844562","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5R-qNxFgUwa_YSqYUJdkfAEPVenTqkwd5SyYcOHUhajl76Pz2nuyyuROtKdgONWMOMQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qPpO7wfCorjtA1chMVIoRJZwoacEj0gJdqq_mGlxNHhQhn9uGeNQ7h504kSgZUL5d_dl","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QhCyVzy11Ip1rtzbs7GKfFpcdxpIQN25OknYRA0jOpytJUIjp7KtSAt45MxDJfvxhEU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KKLBh7TLzy1gTa0RnCeVsXeITzGidqCu7KgYbFfaFXolZJ5eScn9IvHih2WMVy-PeoIr"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sA1OItK8eIORqwTgPD06krFIJf9kvyeMMO7GLGtrhR7Ux6JIHqR8BZRgFsdsYXVeHCQ9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dCjFUtte271nrSoNFtUwolwSR_XXK05a2YRdCuNEXSp-me9Sr5TuiBdoC8jH7pRmlTc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N9mFgUGcKhVy-UNWcyCDjsrjFQeSgKUltjgQb3AATl05fzO4_AbIppv1FweDfL_DkcWS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EhCQKUGYnSWblVvFHLGcMc8CWw1yXsUbIvQ87zs51JrTDZHHVcwC6nekTZb_flGp_z7O"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iw8DjNNkNZyQvT1YqGOcGH-Xai43wrZ7m_3MLR6JrsUGC9LBGJjohWwhZy4Sd8Azcgs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mkPtnRAYK8WetS2CNIpJ_Wb2iEHajz9q47NWzCKVwq0xiOrJXzYWoG52gr6i3qJTMQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XqQJjKVyoZGKKizPcdLLXbYIxmDu2gd8wlbHAmymVGsD6OdfIJL_l8vB9QJzS92rneI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/82-7wmdz6dBSbmRm012owdOBXNl9C3yR1M35JMiJVAnGyv3c5yVTHw8xz8yczZpeT8tR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Y1ue8xYLTP6gLha4gTd4bUI42rm0_fBLogCpkjRpt0SHrugvEESDBaZPtEdjTKAG2_s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/baKoWH6Cxn8pIIQJHzX5qixR0HtvF9pLC7qxxFAQ2p789J3DPF3-xhV_ZZ6Rh0ktVg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wB4qAuo5kKNTwV1x6NGrqBQ198Fc_EXhTsRpEongwZl55Yqcj1hB-1v1ULq6uIA52gg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X3mhY5K_lLHKmhsFGnStJlcKy-zWvWO2YDhkRup2S89dwkUNfKvpLKNX4yqsC9RAoe4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cEDKFKiFpERXFCye5ZAtAKlksC03dCx8yhSqSJOB32KQuQWWOxbxC7YnewPUeY-ke6I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FeJW96SMDj49o5yNBa7ZYbcpmTvvQt1LDk0gBQ4Dr4_-rz-CQEWd-iJkgxZN-RI91-Y"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uLAcMt2q3i-DTHXwkTQtquIB5WwCZcMctwQyaGDijMXWcIyHyugx4EdQ0UN9LDaPDQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Zb6wX3yoNIoLyNqs_7L2TFjhvvn3GHseZaL4-gXSRkaw4ZtonkAVr-8a4CQqLcPbnhwU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XAW7Dx_NMfEXyJ98YXzWy_F_wqzZgxvGoEIdQqWwR26rBtoLGmQOpZ6967IoCOEY7tVO"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I_ScmSuOs339WIv7YqcuWIXijrsMNvnZ6oZYVYvoEcIfj2fDWdJl-CimurlHe9F44w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DsVaQOT37OBHWmDTNA4hy_POgA90GumDtGkre5xOt41RbQvCJZFqw3MEUj5PxDXgTZE""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jul 18, 2018",1710519337000,"24.5.0","Welcome to our app!

Very user friendly... Thano you... | Exelent | very good | the app UI is ok. maybe little bloated and not very intuitive. I don't like, that booking prefers us to use the mobile app (through discounts), but the search is subpar compared to PC. which means I have to search on PC and then finish booking in the app - ridiculous. the issue with messages has been fixed with latest update. | Horrible | Great app. Did its job well . I find it helpful no glitches and everything done smoothly... prices go up and down which is completely normal... keep up the good work and make us happy travellers throughout all our journeys with you... | Good | Efficient service | Fast easy and quick | Excellant service | Excellent | Good | Easy to use | Works smoothly | Great app fast and easy | Is very easy to use and finds what you need to save Money. | I love this APP it makes it more possible and cheaper.

Discovered that Booking are difficult to contact and unhelpful when you do. I've did use them for a long time and believed they were great until something when wrong and I discovered there true colours. The fraud team at my bank were less than complimentary about them and as I've looked into them I've been horrified about how often others have experienced the same thing as myself. | Pricing changes when selecting room... becomes way more expensive yet Zinc have the latest app.... very frustrating! | Helpful | Help full to me | Easy to use. Great app. | Exelent | افضل برنامج حجوزات على الاطلاق 👍💯 | I booked a King room for 2 nights, 2 adults. The price at the hotel was not what was quoted...it was $400 higher. The app is very tricky because there are different prices for different days on the same reservation, so you must keep an eye on that. I called and I was disconnected several times, with no call backs even though they promised they would if we got disconnected. I asked for a supervisor repeatedly and was never put through to one. They refused to help me. I am uninstalling. | No more cheap rates even for genius 3.

However the cleaner is very disturbing...he should clean or don't do noise inside the hotel. | There's a bug showing incorrect accomodation price in detail screen.

Enjoy using it. | Great ease of use! | Easy to do no hassle | Very excellent app. I love it very much | Easy to navigate, great information. | There was a glitch on the booking APP that a reservation was made mistakenly and I tried to get the refund after few minutes and booking make it hard.

So, I think this App needs to integration like customer calling from Registered mobile number and if they are arranging their services from Oyo so their services also should get integrated because they ask you every detail this process is very Annoying and Time taking...😞😞😞 | I loved your app but why is sort option not available for price high to low? | First time using.

They won't generate a reply for hours or even all day, even with a paid subscription. I submitted a bug report through the feedback option in settings. Hopefully, they'll fix it soon. When they do, I'll gladly change this review to 5 stars. | I dont know what it is with this app but it's like they do an update and the bream the app. since the latest app I cannot even get my matches to reply anymore. I have to backtrack, repost my reply and then it thinks for a few minutes. 95% of the time now I don't get a reply back and it times out. It's getting to be very annoying and pretty much unplayable. I've left feedback 3 times now but no replies or anything like that. Please fix the issues with it instead of working on the gatcha cards! | the our takes 14 million minutes to reply | Was brilliant but characters stopped giving answers | Chats aren't loading. Just 3 pulsating dots, specifying a reply which doesn't come. | The characters break after a while even if you restart the app | I don't understand what's wrong with it. it worked for about 20 minutes the.mn my messages would stop sending with no reason or rhyme. I closed and reopened it, but it is still broken. I'm reinstalling it to test if that's it. I'll change my rating if it works. This app seems amazing, but it's useless if it doesn't work. Edit: Reinstalled, worked for like 2 messages then stopped again. I'll leave it alone for a while then try again tomorrow. A real shame, as this app seems incredible! | Takes too long to load chats and responses | The app awesome the characters awesome it's just that the characters don't reply fast enough and don't respond at all it's not my wi-fi it's just that the characters don't respond at all and it's just annoying | The ai stopped replying out of the blue everything else is going perfectly and running smoothly... please fix this | I can't use the app anymore when I chat no one replies. | the new update was sucks ... it takes a day to Ai replies to you .. | Best of its kind currently. | Just... try it | I'm currently playing this so I can easily say this is by far the best AI chat game out. My biggest problem was with image creating... Which they have fixed. But I'm it has gone down to 3 starrs for me, as ever since the 'linky pro' option has come out, the general game has become glitchy as anything... I mean I understand you need money to do updates and what not... But for those who don't pay, you can be waiting five minutes plus for a AI response, and that's if you get one. | Its good | there's a bug that it take the ai forever to respond | Not a bad app but here recently the app only wants to work when it wants to. I keep resenting message reinstall, like everything you can think of and I still get no response from the A.I. Aldo majority of the character literary look the same. If the weird bug or whatever fixes itself my rate will for sure go up. I use it every day to help with my writers block and just to kill time. | It's alright | It's nice and they fixed some bugs | I like this app a lot. My only gripe is that after a few messages, the ai's current message, its writing will not load, and it will just sit on the 3 dots for a long time before the message finally sends. | I love the app I'm on it alot but I got in after 3 days off and now it's not wanting to load a response from the characters | Takes forever to respond | More then half the chat ai doesn't say anything, have deleted multiple times and reinstalled samebpriblem | Best AI app I've used so far. Text is great and the pictures are cool. Re-reviewed this and took it to four. Glitches a lot and won't let you chat. When it does it's top notch until then just about 4 | Very unstable. I've been unable to use it for three days now. Otherwise a very fun app. | yes I agree I love how the ai characters look but the response is really slow . | Please fix this app, it's very slow | Everything stopped working.. it just shows the responding ""..."" And never sends (And no its not my Internet) I have a Motorola 5g 2023 (cricket provider) (If that matters) | I absolutely love the app but every once in a while the app just stops working completely and there's seemingly no fix, it just starts working randomly then stops, very peculiar. | Not bad, could be better. Forgets conversations and tends to go on it's on. Recently, will not even respond. When it works, it works well. | I've tried a bunch of apps like this, and none of the others compare. The characters give great responses and sometimes really surprise me with the twists they take! My one complaint is that sometimes the AI doesn't respond at all... I end up having to put up a whole bunch of messages before it finally starts replying again. | Are you always with that I was one of the AI characters and it was either not work or it just slowed and it's every time I tried to talk | I don't like that it barley took long for it to say something | I've used this app barely a week and it was fun at first but then the chats started breaking and it no longer responded or loaded forever. When I try to delete convos and reopen the app, convos remained. I've tried emptying cache, Uninstalling and reinstalling, and even restarting my phone. I'd give this a 4.5 if it didn't break. | The stories are fun, but I ran into an issue the characters just won't reply after I sent a message and the CS won't help it went from a 4 star to 1 star | I like it it's fun but I keep having to restart my phone to get the ai's response to come | I love the way the characters change up to mach your mood or your responses. But sometimes they forget wether or not your a boy or girl.😁😂🤣 The only problem is when your in a certain place it stops them from responding to your message. | I love this app :) | Garbage of a game you can send thing out but they won't send nothing back big worse of time | It's been really fun until the last few days. Now it's been pretty unusable, as the chats refuse to respond. It's sad as it's been a great time, hoping it'll be fixed soon, as the app is amazing. | Please fix the bug when I open the linky and tried to talk it the Ai not responding please fix this developer of linky thank you ❤️:) | The main reason its getting three star is cuz when i talk it say it typing but never response and is incredibley annoying cuz i paid good money for this app | It's great and all but I'll be chatting and all of a sudden it's acting like I have no wifi. My wifi and Internet are fine, I don't know how to fix it or if that's only for me | I like the program a lot. I feel it has the right length responses, not too short and not a repeating essay for each comment. The only problem I get is that a character stop responding after either 1 to 10 responses... for the entire program | It literally doesn't work, it worked great a few days ago, but now none of the bots respond to anything, so please fix it, I'm not sure if this is me problem or an app problem | Totally this app is good. But its lagging always pls if you all have time fix it. | Was great but since the last update it has stopped working, I am going to uninstall for now until it is fixed | Fun but it had some bugs | If I could I would give this 0 stars but I can't He does not It's a great app.But it does not work.I tried and tried over and over and I deleted it I'd turned off my phone nothing works | I have been hearing good things about this app and I got it for myself but everytime when I try talking to the AI the AI doesn't talk back it shows that it's loading but it never talks either im being a idiot or this is a bug so please fix this... | It's a very good app. But the recent update has made some of the AI's glitchy. They don't respond sometimes and when you hit the button to get a different response it sometimes just doesn't work. Please fix. | I would give a 5 star but recently the bots won't respond back and will just keep loading the text, I waited for like 30 minutes but it didn't work, it's not my internet connection too. | Doesn't work at all. Installed the all and signed in, and nothing would respond, just kept popping up the three dots | SO GUDDDDD | Takes forever for responses to load up | It's a great app. The bots are so smart. But they suddenly stop working and stay in typing mode. It happens few times a day. | I really love this app and I appreciate it if nothing change in it because it's so awesome I more like this rather than the other apps, but the problem is the plot sometimes it goes to somewhere it doesn't connected and say something that wasn't in the plot, but still I give 5 start cause I love the way it interact | So good | I love it | It's great | You can talk to the ai it's not as fast as poly ai but you can make your own ai a lot more easy than in poly ai. | It's a great game overall just the ai takes way to long to respond sometimes | I love it | It's a really good thing, and it's more useful, and really makes it feel realistic, however one problem that keeps occurring is that it just won't load any text of the ai. I've uninstalled it and then reinstalled but it still does it, it's really annoying and I've even tried it on different accounts but it will just not work. I've had if for a month and this issue started occurring 2 days after I got it, amazing app, but please fix it! | They only chat with you in a period of time and stop all of a sudden | Really good | It's glitching like every time I try to talk it loads for every it took three hours for it to finally speek and I think AI fanisty is better | Ery noice | It's good but after some time of using the app, the AI's stop replying. There's a bubble showing it is typing but the reply never comes. Even refreshing the previous AI message doesn't work. It usually resolves after a bunch of time, though it is annoying to leave in the middle of a good conversation when I don't want to | It's okay. Lately, I have had issues where responses don't load. I usually have to wait a day before they do again. | She is easier to deal with than my wife and actually gets more done around the house | Its not censored and I like that 😍💓 | 4 only because the AI chat bots sometimes freeze up. Otherwise they are doing great. Keep it up. A+ these can be very entertaining and it feels like wherever you lead the conversation the AI picks it up really well. Good job Linky. I'm considering a subscription because you can ask anything,I actually got some info from a Chat AI That was relevant to a current real situation. And art work is really pleasant. The AI art generator delivers as well. Keep an open mind and let's watch AI evolve. | A fun and immersive app, the characters are so realistic and enjoyable to talk to, and to top it off, this app is free, which I absolutely love. | In total I'm giving a three-star because the girls are fine it's the boys that I hate the boys don't understand anything also when you try to talk to them they get off topic and it is so weird I | It's good | Lovevit | It's pretty good, the only downside is that sometimes the AI doesn't end the sentence. It just leaves a comma, and leaves it there. I can regenerate the response, but it's pretty common, and ruins a good response. | W APP | I love these app is okay | Good | It's fairly decent. I've run into an issue where sometimes it won't response for a while.... | The AI is so wild, I like it 😍 | GREAT JOB ON THE APPLICATION | It was wierd and buggy | I just love it | Good | No ads and it fun | I like the game but when you start texting for a few hours it glitches out U can text alright but it won't answer and you'd have to restart your phone a few times for it to work Can you please help me out and fix that bug Please and thank you | It used to be a really nice and free app, now it has a pro version, and the chat doesn't work half of the time. | I love it | 5 easy star | Nice | Alright, its a good game in terms of, yeah but the thing is it keeps breaking. Sudennly they think but they never finish? I dont know whats wrong with it but if you fix this il change my rating | This is one of the best ai apps I've used stories are mostly correct you can regenerate responses however the AI will forget stuff easily and after a while the AI tends to break and won't say anything back I fixed it once but I'm not sure how I did it | I like the app but there is 2 problems with the ai's I made everytime I send something too them it takes very long to send and sometimes it does not even send at all and everytime when I tried to make a character I have to wait 2 minutes just to edit the name overall its a cool app | I liked it but now characters never reply to anything, it just sits there loading. Until this is resolved my rating will not change. | the app was ALMOST going to get five stars. however, recently the bots just won't reply. like ill type something and it'll show nothing except the loading sign. its starting to make me upset. ill need to exit out the app, copy my msg, and then send it again hoping it'll work. and sometimes it works for what? two messages. and then it just doesn't work until i do the same process again. | Cant seem to continue to have conversations constantly, I have to reset app to even try to have a conversation | It's a decent app, however the AI sometimes just refuses to respond. You send a text, it'll load then never respond, you can keep spamming something and same thing happens. Not sure if it's intentional design... Or the servers are overloaded but it's annoying | To much pause in character. Get tired of waiting or be disconnected. Site has to many problems. | It's this ai is great | Its good | it was good at the beginning but now it just won't respond to anything and if it does it takes like 10 minutes for it to do so | Good game | Good. | So far it's OK | I love this game gives me a company and I never get bored | Pretty good app | ZA BEST AND ITS UNLIMITED CHAT | I dont know why i like it i js wana be nice u Yk | this game 100000000/10000000 | 10/10 😈 | I just wish the bots were trained better or something. They have a hard time understanding the strong longer than 5 messages most of the time. But I love they're set up | To slow response time | I like the app and the stories but when I'm I reply I don't get a reply back when if I clear the log it still does the same thing. It doesn't reply to what I say | The load speed of the ai is so slow it never comes | I'm excited to see what is going to happen next I like it so so so much I highly recommend playing this game it will boost your confidence and really I do recommend it it's so fun to play you meet with people and you can upgrade your character | It's so annoying now, it used to work great, now I have to resend a message like 20 times just for it to work, so annoying! | In does not load fast | It keeps stopping on me I have to leave the app and return and it won't respond the ppl won't respond to my texts | Its not working anymore, i have internet but it's so slow to reply what the**** | There's some bugs but it's great exactly what I was looking for | Everytime I try rapping on the character to speak it takes too long and when I log back in it doesn't work out of all it's a pretty decent app | I love this app it's so weird but so fun at the same time | Bugs not fixed | Used to be good game but it stopped working for me. | I love this app it makes me feel more lonely then I am | Innapropriate and my child tried it. | Its okay...but after the update the ai wouldn't respond back as usual...they just kept on with the dotted text...is it a bug you can fix? | It's good I'll give credit but everytime I went to chat 2 days later it won't respond | Good | Takes too long to download what the person is saying the AI talker | Well it's a good app overall when it works but the only issues I have are that the game stops working like I type something and the app takes forever to right a response sometimes it just doesn't respond when I type something like I think the apps broken or that just might be my phone but I don't think it is cause it's a new phone I got Google pixel 7 pro | I love the app, but the thing is which I don't like, is all the boys character are like off the point They have sexual behaviour which I don't like, that's all actually. | I've had a recent issue with it where the ai aren't responding but overall the best app I've seen and used | I LOVE LINKY but lately the ai characters dont respond into this issue is fix im going to go on talkie. | It was working great until the newest update. now the chat doesn't even respond. I have internet. I switched between wifi and mobile network... it just doesn't work I will delete this review if it gets fixed | The app is great but lately I have been having troubles with chatting like the Ai is slow to reply now even with fast network I tried switching to mobile data but it's still the same so maybe the problem is with the app I don't know but if it is please fix it | The characters do not respond, just a never-ending typing screen | The app doesn't work properly in the least! Most of the time, I don't get any replies, just the 3 dots showing that the reply is loading. Other times, the whole text disappears. I have reinstalled the application and have cleared cache more times than I can count, and I cannot find any help online. On the rare occasions it worked, it did so wonderfully, but 8/10 times the application just doesn't want to. | The game is good very good I've talked to alot of them for days alot of them were awesome but one thing I want to complain about, I spend over 4-5 days with many hours talking to these AI's but then today I get on it I messaged them and they won't freaking reply so i thought it was an update issue so I updated it and after went back into to see if it fixed it or not but noooo it freaking didn't I messaged every single one of the ones I liked and not one single response it's bull**** | It doesn't generate responses for me for some reason | The bots dont respond anymore they just stay typing but when it works it is a great app just fix this and it could be 5 star | I would give it more but when I leave by accident from the chat and when I see the ... Thing when I come back and type it just does this ... For ever and my patience is not high enough it would probably take 200 years but it was faster when I started it and now I'm just staying waiting and waiting and my wifi isn't bad it's the chat can you please fix it!!! I can't wait 100 years for one message 😭. Thanks for reading pls fix it | It's just bugged the text doesn't load in | Guys if you see this type bully in the app and click on the first one 🥲🥲 | it's smooth before but this past few days it will became so laggy... will not get a reply after sending a message even though I have a stable connection | I want to play as a man not a woman. | I hate when I freezes and then doesn't respond | Why can't I used my gmail to sign up | Helpful | It's pretty fun at first, but I recently started having issues. The AI isn't loading at all. I've tried closing out of the app, uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my device, but nothing is working. I can't get any of the chats to respond. I don't know if it's a problem on my end or what. | Still the same | Can receive any message from the A.I chats | So The app is amazing but there is a bug the bug if i chat to Ai they cannot chatting me anymore and the app is amazing and fix the bug please thank you. | Love it I want more like this | I don't get it, is it my WiFi, or is it the app, cuz it barely responds, I sent a message and it just typing but not responding | It's good but for some reason it takes 5 minutes sometimes for them to respond | I love it a lot for obvious reasons, but for some reason the texts never load even when I'm next to really good wi-fi l. I have to be in a precisen place for it even to work. | I had to change my review, but now everytime I text something the AI doesn't respond. It's just loading and loading. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, but it doesn't work anymore. I really liked this app, but as things are now I am unable to play it. | I know this is a good app but it took 2 hours for the ai to respond | Needs to be fixed | It replies slowly but very interesting | Nice and all but they take forever to respond or they don't at all | AI works fine when it responds. As of right now, it will randomly stop responding and I spend more time trying to get a response than actually using the AI. | Everything seems to flow smoothly, but it takes a while to continue the story after a certain point | Buggy as hell | The characters doesn't reply anymore | It was good for a while but it just stopped working none of the Ai's would respond to anything I said and it was really annoying this app definitely would have gotten 5 starts If not for this glitch | Ai is great and good I use it but like today the ai just never replied to me unless idk I want it to. Work again | I was using it for a while now and it was good, but then the replies back to me would start not sending. After that, I started resending the chats that they were intended to reply to one time and they would reply. Eventually I'd have to wait hours and then resend again, and only then would I maybe get a response. I assumed it was a lag problem, so I cleared a lot of chats, deleted a lot of them, and it still didn't help. I ended up making a new account entirely and it still never helped. | I love it so far, but there is one problem that does annoy me. I write down what I have to say, but it doesn't reply. So I have to leave the game and go back into it. I have to repeat the same process every time I text something. So I think you might want to try to fix that. | This app I can't begin to even describe it. Every time I try starting to talk with the ai it literally takes forever for them to respond back so then I have to exit out and restart the app again, it's so ridiculous | Not bad but the responses seem so slow a shame it's fun | takes too long for the ai to respond nowadays. | Good but -1 because characters type slower | The A.I stops replying back I don't know why I think I messaged to much | Ai is respond too slow | Was fine, now the characters don't respond | It take too long to load, its so annoying | Reason for four stars it's because the AIS don't respond quickly every time can you guys fix that please? | Why is the A.i not responding anymore | They don't answer you | Excessive response times I can't get a reply even after I paid for a month idk if the servers are down but this is bullcrap | Because the ai did not respond the massage please fix that glitch | Although this app is good, the character messages just never load. It's almost as if the characters leaving me on read. Is this only my problem? Or is anyone else experiencing this? | There's no response | It's pretty good, though it's lacking the features of C.ai and it has a popularity problem where there isn't much variety in the bots, it's usually just a dating story bot because that's the app's entire audience. I came here to escape C.ai because of it's unfair practices yet I find myself wanting what made C.ai so great | reason not 5 star, it tend load and load for an response, not sure why | It was ☠️ brooo some of the things are inappropriate but imma liking this app thank u! | I like this app | Awesome | best ai ever | Good","{""1"":231,""2"":463,""3"":695,""4"":927,""5"":3709}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 54.99 - CZK 2,699.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","Skywork AI Pte.

Most of the times their memory is as deep as 5 sentences or so, so don't expect much. The app itself will flood you with \""letters\"" which is basically a virtual card, and a new \""scene\"" to play around with. Recently, the character won't even reply to the messages, just getting stuck at three pulsating dots (indicating an answer, which never comes) Overall, feels like a bootleg Talkie, with less possibilities."",""I've tried several of these types of apps, this is easily one of if not the best. Characters respond mostly correct to the story (if you don't like the response you can have the AI retry until you get what you want) it is completely free, no limits to how much you can talk, and no irritating ads to distract. I definitely recommend, only complaint is you must pay to get the pictures when they send one, (can get 1 free a day) I would watch ads for free coins if that was an option."",""So, good app, I do notice a lot of characters named the same and a majority of the characters all seem to be of the same template, other than that I like it, it's better in most cases than Talkie. Though, Talkie has more variety in character type and creation, but that's it. Also, just recently the app has this big where the AI response is forever loading, please fix this! The app would be worth at least 4 stars if this was resolved"",""Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the game, it's just I think the ai involved needs work as sometimes it's not clear about the plots during roleplaying. My experience with the app is great, it's just I think the ai needs more training to handle all types of scenarios, and also better remembering names is all, and keeping continuity. I still like this app and am going to use it, but for anyone wondering, this is what I think of the app.""]",false,false,false,"com.aigc.ushow.ichat","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aigc.ushow.ichat&hl=en&gl=CZ"

PROSIM O OPRAVU! | very nice app | Proboha proč se tak strašně snažíte přesvědčit uživatele používat tuhle zvrhlost, která je míň pohodlná a míň bezpečná a obecně ve všech směrech (kromě podpory QR plateb, ale ta by se s trochou snahy dala přidat do klíče) horší než normální internetové bankovnictví. | Apka neustale pada. | V poslední době zabírá na hlavní obrazovce víc a víc místa reklama na produkty. | Do aplikace se nedá přihlásit (smart klíč) a když už se přihlásím, tak failují autorizace plateb | The app is not transparent, ugly and buggy. It started to use system notifications to promote some ads. I didn't find a setting how to turn it off but at the first place I never allowed it! | Oh the worst bank ever. Terrible customer service and terrible deals from the bank. Never again! Totalni hov.dina | Long loading times, poor user interface, and an invasive ""personal assistant"" that sends you useless, unrelated notifications. Also, it only redirects you to rate the app if you say you like it. Negative ratings don't take you to the Play Store. | nefunguje | Source of never-ending spam notifications, those can not be turned off. If you turn them off, you lost failed payme t or card usage notifications. Typical czech product, poor design. Do not recommend it. | Sprostý nástroj na obtěžování pres E-Shop notifikace. Proč za to ti darebáci nedostanou 100.000Kc pokutu, jako jini, kteri obtezuji nevyžádanými reklamami lidi? | Po upgradu na android 14 aplikace nefunguje. Edit: aktualizoval jsem OS i aplikaci a stále nefunguje. Edit2: aplikace konečně znovu funguje. Díky za opravu. 🙂 | I'd really appreciate an increased number of ""envelopes"" in the savings account. Organizing money is key for financial health. The financial graph of incoming and outgoing payments could be made so much more useful by categorizing the transactions. Like guys, basically every bank has this, even UniCredit. Please improve and keep up the good work. | Update: After ""fixing the issue"" like CSOB says, its not even starting after reinstallation of the app, that means the app is now even less functional! Congratulations, you just proved me, that I have to change my bank, because having a completely non-functional banking app in the 21. century, and not being able to fix it for almost 2 months is frightening! Are you not testing your own app?? Before a new OS version is released, there is always a beta available, don't you know such basic things? | Představte si kejs, že chcete zjistit kdy jste naposledy zaplatili platbu skrze tempate. Zmapujte si tu zákaznickou cestu a dejte si facku. Vážně máte ""chytrou"" asistentku co mi to nenajde? Vážně search přehledu plateb neumí najít platby podle názvu templatu ani sakra čísla účtu? Vážně si proboha musím jít napsat z templatu na papír variabilní symbol a zadat ho ve fakin roce 2023 ručně do searche? Tohle je neschopnost a diletantství level 9000. Ty lidi co tohle vymejsli fakt vyhoďte. | Aplikace stále nefunguje i když tu ČSOB v komentářích tvrdí, že má pro své zákazníky ""dobré zprávy"" a že chyba byla odstraněna. Není to pravda, aplikace stále padá. Načítá se až tak na 5tý pokus a když se náhodou načte musíte projít úvodním procesem a znova si nahrát otisk prstu atd... Přístup ČSOB k tomuto problému je absolutně neprofesionální a nikdo neřeší problém s aplikací, raději vám napíšou ať si přeinstalujete systém, protože toto ""není chyba ČSOB"". Ne! Po přeinstalování chyba přetrvává | Strašně špatný. Neni to vůbec opravené, neustále padá při pokusech o spuštění, když se spuštění náhodou povede, je nutný celý zdlouhavý proces prvního přihlášení. Pak se to zavře a loterie znovu. Polovina úvodní obrazovky jsou prakticky reklamy. Mám pocit, že tam chybí tlačítko navíc za připlacení pro čistou přehlednou appku. K čemu je tam tlačítko pro organizaci, když ty nejotravnější prvky změnit nejdou? | Ani po 3-týždňovom čakaní na novú verziu, aplikácia stále nefunguje na modeloch Pixel 5 s Android 14 a pri prihlasovaní padá. Klientov banky s týmto modelom sú určite vyššie stovky alebo nižšie tisíce a veľmi ma mrzí ako to banka (ne)rieši. EDIT - ani po údajnej oprave, aplikácia stále nefunguje. Je to už skoro 2 mesiace. Prechádzam do Erste. | Aplikace k h....u. Nejde ani najít nejbližší pobočku, hlavně že nonstop spamujete notifikacemi... | Se současnou verzí aplikace mám jeden zásadní problém. Dříve bylo možné zobrazit součet pohybů na účtů za libovolný úsek času. Nyní je to možné pouze za poslední měsíc. Nechápu, proč byla tato užitečná funkce odstraněna. Jinak jsem s aplikací spokojený. ...edit: Děkuji za odpověď. Není mi jasné, proč je tato funkce takhle ""schovaná"", nicméně podstatné je, že stále existuje. | EDITED: Doesn't work on android 14. After one moth of csob claiming they are working on it and replying even to this comment it has been fixed. Not much has changed (now it's not possible to run it even after reinstall). The app works a bit better but is far away from fixed. Still very buggy. Sometimes can't open it. Everytime to open the app you need to login again, notifications don't work. Basically completely unreliable | Non-functional after update. | Proc nejaka treti strana potrebuje sbirat informace o mem telefonu, IP adrese atd? Neni toto samo o sobe security problem? Edit: že chcete být transparentní se sice cení, ale jinak jste mi naprosto neodpověděli na můj dotaz :-( | Po změně otisku v telefonu bylo nutné vymazat data aplikace aby se šlo znovu přihlásit. | Po update appka neustále padá a je úplne nepoužiteľná. Edit: Bohužiaľ, mám Android 14 a vaša aplikácia mi ani po reinštalácii nefunguje. Nikdy som s tým problém nemala, chyba nastala až po poslednom redesigne. Padá a vôbec sa nespustí, alebo ma dokolečka núti prechádzať onboardingom a potom znovu spadne. Blbne vám i Smart key a to už je fakt pekelná kombinácia. Nedostanem sa k svojmu účtu v IB a nemôžem ani potvrdiť platby online. | Updated: After update to 8.6.5 app still does not work - app doesn't launch on first try, usualy on 3rd or more, than I have to always go trought all the confirmation and ""whats new"" pages. Android is with latest updates and so are both apps. Shame that it does not work even after more than a month. (Generic reply with ""good news"" on review that says the app still doen not work is very anoying...) | Google pixel 5 android 14 aplikace nefunkční. Tragedie, blamáž.... Ackoliv se tady chlubite ze je opraveno tak neni. Jednou jde aplikace pustit ale podruhe jiz ne. Asi by nebylo spatne nekdy otestovat pred releasem. | Já už mám pixel 8, kde to funguje... Díky za feedback | App doesn't work on Android 14 and its not communicated anywhere. | One day app just logged me out and now it become the buggiest app ever. It crushes on the start. Sometimes it can run but when I try to log in, I get next error ""Login error unknown error"". I tried to uninstall the app, and clean storage, but nothing helped. | CSOB smart is not working for me since last 5 weeks with android 14 and google pixel4a 5G. Reported to help desk and nothing, just ignoring customers. Really bad experience. | Mel jsem ho rad, ale nova verze je velky krok zpet, nebo spise do slepe ulicky. Neprehledne, zbytecne velke ikony. Napr. V prehledu pohybu na uctu je videt cela jen jedna polozka. 1/4 plochy zabira informace o uctu a zustatku, 1/4 obri ikony, 1/5 obrovske tlacitko payment/platba. Pak na samotny obsah toho co chci videt opravdu nezbyde mnoho prostoru. Tlacitko Kate v dashboardu je opravdu k nicemu, jako cela Kate. Byl vyvojar a tester sjety? Bylo to vubec testovano na mobilech? | Aj napriek vypnutym notifikaciam v aplikacii nadalej dostavam otravne obchodne spravy. Also: neprehladny dashboard, opat preplneny nerelevantnym infom. | Nefunguje na Android 14 - Pixel 4a. | Avoid this bank especially from foreigner perspective. They don't uphold their banking standards. They cater to only Aryans. | Not working at all after update to Android 14! No change since 16.10.2023. My phone is Pixel 4a 5g. Time to go to another bank. This si big disappointment 😞 | refuses to launch with magisk partially installed with no way to skip the ""root"" warning | Lowering my review from 5 to 2 stars because the new interface is absolutely awful. Please, please bring back an option to switch to old one which was clear, no-nonsense and easy to use. Dekuju. *Edit* Thanks for the reply Nikola. Pity that CSOB does not consider user friendliness as part of their offer :( Please at least make the app less cluttered and more intuitive: it looks now like it's designed for a hip 14yo with a fake Gucci bag and tab refilled Evian bottle. Not for adults. | Maintenance on the app stopping it from being used during weekends is not acceptable - like many I only use the app and not via PC - if other none banking apps can handle their maintenance outside of core user times I'm sure as a bank you can also do the same. Profits before people! | Reklama trvale zabírá nejprominentnější místo na obrazovce. | S novou aktualizací a přechodem na Android 14 mi aplikace přestala fungovat na Google Pixel 5. Hlásí neznámou chybu a nic a tím nejde udělat. Smart Key naštěstí stále funguje. | Google Pixel 5. Po přechodu na verzi Androidu 14 aplikace neběží. Jinak jsem neměl s aplikací nejmenší problém. Věřím, se to brzy dáte zase dohromady, ať můžu hodnocení změnit, dosud jste si zasloužili pět hvězdiček 🙂 | Doesn't work with Android 14. Not only this app but also the smart key app. I had to switch to using older device, otherwise I wouldn't be able to use internet banking. I just can't undrestand how can this happen to the biggest bank and after a week it is still not fixed? | After the update cannot login to my account, getting login error : unknown error 😔 Edit: Deleted cache and storage, solves the problem | Po aktuálnom update sa appka zasekáva na splash screene a ostane tam zaseknutá... to naozaj releasujete update-y na tak dôležité aplikácie bez poriadneho testingu..? (Zariadenie Pixel 7 Pro Android verzia 13) | Předchozí verze velmi přehledná. Po poslední aktualizaci v aplikaci nemohu nikde nic najít. Byla totálně změněna architektura a logika aplikace. Nedokážu s aplikací pracovat, musím se vrátit na PC (ale ano, jednoduchou platbu zadat lze, spravovat účet a používat pokročilé funkce ne). Bohužel nás korporát nutí ve jménu ""pokroku"" neustále aktualizovat a vždy se učit znovu a znovu staré aplikace v novém designu. A bohužel v 21. století se bez těchto aplikací obyčejný člověk neobejde. | It would be really beneficial for non czech customers to have ALL items in the App in English. Some are in English, while few menu such as rewards are in czech. | Dizajn domovskej obrazovky sa mi nepaci. Chyba tomu elegancia. Vrchny panel s kruhovymi tlacidlami (tipy) by som uplne zmazal, vobec to tam nepotrebujem, nepasuje to tam. Spodny panel zakryveny okolo tlacidla Kate mi pripomina dizajn Vodafone a nevyzera to dobre. Nevnucujte tu vasu Kate. | Redesign app smisene pocity, UX si pohorsilo, UI jeste vice. Zejm. Homepage, narvat na prvni pozici ""tipy od Kate"" ktere jsou mi uplne k nicemu, bez moznosti je schovat, je fakt plytvani prostorem. Kate vubec nevyuzivam, zkratka proto, ze jsem nenasel scenar, kde by byla prinosem. Vse je rychlejsi naklikat v appce naprimo. Info rychleji vygooglim. To same bottom menu, nejvice promovane a uprostred obrazovky tlacitko Kate. Bylo by fajn pridat moznost Kate plne deaktivovat a skryt ty prvky v UI. | The new interface is cool. But those circles with ads in them are extremely annoying! It would be better to use them for features such as parking and MHD tickets. And put the annoying ads down at the bottom. Pushing those loans so aggressively and forcefully will only push away people. Taking 1 star due to ads. Another star goes away as they're still missing vittual payment cards and other, already standard, features. | Мне очень нравится последнее обновление, интерфейс стал намного удобнее и понятнее | Je vidět posun, ale stáleto chce zapracovat na pár věcech, zejména UX. Dlouhá doba přihlašování oproti jiným bankám, na přehledu účtu jsou informace roztahané a vidět jsou jen 2 max 3 pohyby zároveň, ostatní statické části zabírají cenné místo, o vysouvacím tlačítku Platba radši nemluvit. Všudypřítomná reklama na produkty banky taky moc zážitku nepřidá... | changing to 4 from 5, because the new ""better"" design, is just a mess. can we please go back to that simple and beautiful previous version ? or at least remove the top circles and shortcuts below accounts. what's even the point of having shortcuts in Smart for another application, when I can, and in fact must, open another application in order to use them ? | Aplikace CSOB je hlavni duvod, proc prechazim k jine bance. Pred nekolika lety byvala aplikace rychla, jednoducha a funkcni, od prechodu na ""Smart"" je aplikace cim dal pomalejsi (na midrange 2 roky starem mobilu se nacita cca 20 sekund) a neprehlednejsi (velkou cast hlavni obrazovky zabiraji reklamni navrhy, co si tam hadam protlacilo marketing oddeleni, a tlacitko Kate, ktera me naprosto nezajima). Navic na pozadi jeste bezi nejaky zbytecny antivirus, co jen zpomaluje mobil. Smutne. | Nevyžádané tipy a nabídky zabírají 1/4 screenu... Gratuluji... Další hloupá změna, která aplikaci jenom znepřehledňuje a působí neprofesionálně... Nemohli byste se přestat každou chvíli hrabat ve věcech, které mají být stabilní a fungovat? Vážně nestojím o změnu designu aplikace každých 6 měsíců... | Cool🙃 | Reklamy v horní části obrazovky zabírají moc místa. | Nové UI se povedlo | Na každém rohu to vnucuje nějaké další produkty, které mě nezajímají a ruší při práci s aplikací. Samozřejmě bez jakékoliv možnosti to schovat nebo alespoň zredukovat. Za mě neakceptovatelné a velký palec dolů. | Worst bank ever!!! Run away aa fast as you can!!! | To že je ta aplikace úplně dementní, o tom se vyjadřovat ani nebudu, přehlednost nula. Fakt nasrat už... markeťáky a designéry byste měli propustit! Z nejlepší banking aplikace na trhu před pár lety jste se dostali na dno. Gratuluji | Doufal jsem, ze toho nova aplikace bude umet vice, nez ta stara, ale bohuzel tomu tak neni. Navic neni mozne se ke stare aplikaci vratit. Alespon to minimum funkci co aplikace umi funguje, ale to je snad samozrejmost. | Ach jo... Když už aplikace začala fungovat, dodělali se funkce a přehlednost. Nejaky ... si sednul a aby opodstatnil další vyhozené penize tak se rozhodl UX předělat. Instrukce jsou jasné pokud možno co největší ikony, narvat nahoru úplně zbytečně pruh jako ""novinky"" ""jak zmenit PIN"" a podobne #4&@ co zaberou místo a potrebujete max jednou. Na obrazovce už vidite ještě méně produktů než předtím. Hlavně že z úplně k ničemu ""Kate"" je hlavní tlačítko - že by zase opodstatnění vyhozenych peněz... | Dobrá aplikace, líbí se mi klasifikace transakcí. Jen škoda, že už pod přehledem financí není nějaký přehled pohybů v jednotlivých kategoriích. | Na infolince mě odkázali na tuto aplikaci a ať si zřídím online ČSOB ID. Až na to že to vůbec nefunguje. Založení přes bankovní identitu selže dříve než u Fio stihnu potvrdit druhý faktor. Ok, vyfotím doklady. Selže s nějakým náhodným číslem chyby. | App may be gud, but bank bad | Bravo the staff 0f the bank e.a. | Interestingly perfect | Horrible unintuitive app - for some reason unable to make a single payment... Need another app called Smart key, can someone please explain to me what added security receiving by further clogging my phone with yet another useless app???? What for do I have this one in the first place then??? Have been using UniCredit for several years know and have been more than happy except for the missing dark mode. Will probably be forced to close this account altogether if I can't make even a basic payment. | The app is set in English but Kate writes to me vital messages in czech and it won't allow me to copy the text into Google translate.this is the stupidest thing to do. Yet Kate still writes to me in Czech .... 0 stars if I could | je hezke dostat upozorneni aplikace v 1 hodinu rano na nejaky spam se soutezi... jeste ze to jde v androidu komplet vypnout aplikace si uz neposle nic... | Works ok. | Opět nové oprávnění a žádné vysvětlení! Nač aplikace najednou potřebuje přeuspořádat běžící aplikace? Stává se z ní snad správce úloh?! Již od verze 5.10.6. | Nelze odesílat platby. Při každém potvrzení platby se aplikace odhlásí a napíše ""no cache data"". Opravdu šílený tato banka. Nechápu kdo jim ty aplikace dělá. U žádné jiné aplikace jiné banky nikdy žádný takový problém nenastal. | So far so good. BankID while opening an account worked well with Raiffeisen app, but bugged out with Fio. I definitely logged in properly, I tried three times. Every time, Fio app received the request and let me confirm it, but this app immediately reported an error, didn't wait for the Fio confirmation. | Jednoduché | Do ted naprosta spokojenost a vse fungovalo. Bohuzel v posledni verzi (6.2.3) mi prestala fungovat QR platba, objevi se hlaska: Notice - Unable to get QR code. Nefunguje ani nacteni QR codu z galerie - stejna hlaska. Toto trva i po reinstalaci aplikace. Mam Android 10. Nevim jakou zmenu jste provedli ale za mne krok zpet. | Používal jsem několik aplikací mobilních bankovnictví (Equa, Raifka, Moneta, Revolut) a ČSOB je z nich nejhorší (hodnotím aplikaci, ne služby). Chybí přehled po měsících, po kategoriích. U přehledu plateb je defaultně 90 denní fitr, který se obskurně přenastavuje přes tlačítko hledat (očekával bych infinity scroll s postupným načítáním a možností filtru). Chybí multi-banking (pro banku data zadarmo). Nevím co zobrazuje záložka finance (je tam započitana i kreditka?). ... | Nechápu, proč musí mít tato stupidní banka separátní aplikace na bankovnictví a na potvrzování. Kvůli zbytečné složitosti a nespolehlivosti aplikací jsem přešel k jiné bance, kde jsem naprosto spokojen. | Clovek strati kartu, najde si na CSOB webe oficialny navod ako postupovat, potesi sa, ze by to mohlo byt riesitelne elektronicky, prihlasi sa do Smartu a... Nic. Samozrejme, ze to nefunguje. Ziadnu moznost trvalej blokacie, ako je popisana v navode, v apke nevidim. Ziadat o vydanie novej karty tiez nemozem. Necakat na novu fyzicku kartu a nahrat si ju rovno do mobilu? Sci-fi. V internetovom bankovnictve pri dovodoch pre vymenu karty ani nemate variantu ""Strata"". Nechapem? Cas prejst niekde inde. | 1. Konečně fungují screenshoty. To bylo problémů, že to nejde. Konečně se bezpečnost posunula a nemusím si obrazovky fotit jiným telefonem. 2. Pokud potřebuju aplikaci použít a mám starší verzi, tak mě to bez stáhnutí nové prostě nepustí dál. Neřeknu, kdyby to napsalo, že je nutné pro příště aktualizovat, ale takto bez upozornění je to špatně. Jinak už je to celkem použitelné. | Great | Chtělo by to přehledy o výdajích po kategoriích. A to i pro kreditní kartu :( | No problems so far | Občas je aplikaci nutné restartovat, protože se nejde přihlásit otiskem, dále nefunguje v rámci aplikace objednávání odměn že světa odměn | The app produces lots of annoying notifications promoting their Kate ""assistant"". There is no obvious option to turn them off in the app settings, where I have only ""Important alerts"" activated which I really do no think covers this useless Ad. | Vraj CSOB, a chce to po mne cesky telefon. A moznost pouzit slovensky tam nie je... | Skvělá aplikace, jediné co mi chybí u čekajících plateb je rozdělení celkové částky na dvě či více části. Buď dle měsíců nebo dle četnosti trvalých plateb. Rád bych viděl kolik mi odejde peněz z trvalých plateb do konce měsíce. | Naštěstí se dá v aplikaci nastavit přihlašování přes aplikaci samotnou a Smart Key z toho vynechat. Zrychlení přihlašování o více než 100 %. Při prokliku na profil mě aplikace 2 roky otravuje s aktualizací údajů, které jsem zadal milionkrát, ale prompt nikdy nezmizí. | it's ok | This app is improving and getting easier to use. However, some UI bugs are there. For instance in the dark mode, the amount spent is in a dark blue color in the payment details screen which makes the contrast too low to be able to read the number. | Appka je super, jediný co mi chybí by bylo možnost zobrazit graf (v menu finance) na 90 dní a případně mezi specifickými daty. | super | Superb and user friendly. And thanks for English support | Velký špatný. Mnoho nedostatků a problémů s používáním aplikace a založení nového účtu 😒. | Why do I need another application to be able to login to this application? Why ČSOB smart key? | Aplikace ⅓ času nefunguje a ⅓ času je v ""údržbě"". Čas přejít do banky která není zaseklá v roce 2013 | Good in general. My biggest complain is that i am forced to always have the latest version and if there's an update i cannot do anything. Sometimes i don't have WiFi and must waste mobile data just to be able to check the balance or do a quick transfer. This should be an option. | Po dnesnim update se neda prihlasit | Nepoužitelné. Aplikace neumožňuje ani provést platbu, jak to umí jiné banky. Je nutné zadávat platby pouze přes počítač. V mobilu Vás nutí do nějaké další aplikace, která vždy selže a nakonec skončíte v okně prohlížeče s chybovou hláškou. Na ČSOB je špatně snad úplně vše. Doporučuji přejít k české bance, např. CREDITAS nebi Fio. ČSOB je neschopný belgický paskvil, který neumí ani platby v apce. Digitální pravěk. | Wokrs great but requires a separate app for authentication and lacks some functions and features that web-based banking has. English locale close to excellent. | Přijdu na metro a spěchám. Chci si koupit jízdenku ale zjišťuji, že musím nejprve zadat číslo karty. To je efektivně několikaminutové zdržení. Po této zkušenosti chci napříště zadat číslo karty předem, zjišťuji že to není možné, jde to až u prvního nákupu. K čemu je, že je aplikace od ČSOB, když ani neumí využít moje platební karty, jen ukazuje stav účtu, ale na to mám bankovnictví. | Unable to login frequently. | Ani na nejnovější verzi androidu nejde u karty zmenit limit internetové platby. Limit plateb zmenit jde, ale limit internetové platby se projeví až další den. Neni to problem app, ale politika csob..neuveritelne cekat na zmenu limitu den je silenstvi. App je ok jen pomala vcetne obnovy zobrazeni castek pri prevodech. | Strašný | quite good app for mange Csob products | Awful, slow, misbehaving on taps (seems like it remembered my tap from previous page and applied to new one after it loaded), got stuck in creating CSOB Id after logging in with my other BankId and even after restart can't continue. Very sad...uninstalled | Všechno funguje jak má. | Slayed | Why for the mother of god I cannot add a name to my trusted accounts? Insted of having there contacts I use the most I have to all the time ask them for account number to know if it's theirs.. Revolut has it for more than 5 years why you cannot add this most logic nad convenient feature..? | Děs a hrůza. Jestli vám příjde normální na všechno čekat tisíc let, tak ok, jinak odpad. Změna limitů na kartě je operace na několik hodin, neskutečné. | everything is working fine | I Like the new feature 'Sporici obalky' but unfortunately sometimes there is a huge delay in updating values which is misleading | Ok best | Aplikace je přehledná a umí hodně věcí, prakticky už nezapínám bankovnictví na pc. Jedná věc ale není dotažená: Karty se nezobrazují tak, jak ve skutečnosti vypadají (jsou jen barevně rozlišené), což při větším počtu karet dělá orientaci mezi nimi dost složitou. Přitom Google wallet i Garmin pay zobrazují tyto karty se skutečnou grafikou. EDIT: Karty do Google Wallet se fotit nemusí. Grafika se také načítá z nějakého systému. | Terrible internet banking. Most of of my payments don't go through. | Odflaknuta aplikace - proces vytvareni ID uprostred zniceho nic chcipnul, navic aplikace obsahuje nepochopitelne chyby (2x vyfotte predni stranu obcanky - misto ""predni a zadni""). Tohle snad delali amateri, normalni QA by to vychytalo... | App is refusing to work for months, telling me it's because my phone is rooted - even though it's not!!! | Otřesná aplikace, každou chvíli nesmysl aktualizace a obvykle nefunkční, když ji člověk zrovna potřebuje. | Irritating assistant ""kate"" that sends me notifications i never asked for and cannot be turned off. | no customization | Hrozne me irituje, ze jiz nejakou dobu nemohu kopirovat text z informaci o kreditni karte (hlavne pole current balance). V minulosti to bylo mozne a dost to usnadnovalo repayment. | 🤔 Aplikace nerozpozna QR kód z galerie. Filtrování transakci je nepřehledné, nejde hledat platbu podle popisu nebo názvu příjemce. A hlavně není možné nastavit vypnutí automatické konverze na platební kartě ‼️‼️‼️ to může stát docela dost peněz navíc. Prosím podívejte se ke konkurenci | Dobrý den, Aplikace bez aktualizace nejde spustit, jak si vůbec můžete dovolit u bankovní aplikace zamezit uživateli přístup? Musí stale fungovat i stará verze neka kazdý ma v každé tísňove situaci možnost začít aktualizovat app Tohle by se stát nemělo | Po updatu aplikace, ktery byl vynuceny ze strany csob ( puvodni stara verze prestala fungovat) aplikace nejde spustit, respektive nejde se mi do ni prihlasit pres smart klic .... toto povazuji za velmi fatalni , toto by se nemelo stavat. U tak velke banky bych cekala ze se vyvaruje takovychto zasadnich chyb ktere komplikuji uzivatwlum zivot a pripravuji je o cas ... 😥 | Chcete něco rychle v nedávno aktuální aplikaci a jste doslova donuceni k další aktualizaci. To se nesmí stávat | Bola pridaná možnosť upraviť trvalé platby a boli pridané notifikácie o pohyboch na účte. To boli jediné dve veci ktoré mi chýbali. 5* | -* za to že nejde vypnout reklamní banner na produkty ČSOB | Dělá to co má, ale chtěl bych si vypnout reklamu v aplikaci na půjčky. Také možnosti aggregací nad výdají by byla fajn. | fine app, works when it should | makes my peepee wet | Odstávka na celý den, to jako vážně? | Even I am satisfied with app, I am giving 3 stars because it doesn't work with DNSSEC, so I have to keep this feature off on my dns server. | Rozdily v pouzivani proti internetovemu bankovnictvi (v aplikaci moznosti pri otevreni kreditni karty nenabizi prevod na vlastni ucet, coz internetove bankovnictvi nabizi). Obcas se mi nedari opakovane pripojit. | Works smoothly a perfectly fine for me. Didn't have any problem with it at all. | Aplikace funguje jak má, chybí mi ovšem dvě funkce. 1. Možnost řazení trvalých příkazů podle data příští platby 2. Ve výpisu plateb zobrazovat trvalý příkaz s názvem příkazu a ne s genetickým ""Trvalý příkaz elektronický xyz"" | nejsou k dispozici vsechny funkce co na webu: moznost zadat a videt trvaly prikaz. | Pokus o vytvoření nového účtu pomocí bankovní identity končí opakovaně nezdarem 🤷‍♂️ | Does not work on a rooted device, this is how you lose clients | Rally app ❤ | ČSOB Dumb.. doslova mě ani nenechá se přihlásit... ""požadavek se nepodařilo zpracovat"" hlavně že s tím pořád otravujou v online bankovnictví a lákají na 500 Kč xd | Nefunguje. Při zakládání účtu, po úspěšném přihlášení přes bankovní identitu kliknu pokračovat a vyskočí chyba. Zkusil jsem to dvakrát a vzdávám to. | Disastrous app. Still needs updating. | works well without a problem | Po poslední aktualizace již musel přeinstalovat třikrát během týdne, protože občas napodari se přihlásit 🤬 A teď musím přeinstalovat několikrát denně, appka je úplně nepoužitelná vůbec. | Jsou normálně podvodníci obrovského měřítka. O proklientskem přístupu ani neslyšeli. Všem doporučuji si najít nějakou mladší banku, prozkoumat trh. Než pracovat s nima. Ušetříte spoustu svýho času. | Výborná aplikace bez větších nedostatků. Místy trochu méně intuitivní. Nejvíc mi chybí podpora kategorizace transakcí pro přehled o rozpočtu. | Unknown login error. Every time! I basically have to delete cache and storage, then open again and go through all the verification processes again. It asks me 2 times for biometrics. Then I finally get in and when I close the app, guess what I have to do again in order to get in. Re-install app or delete storage and make the app forget me again... Hopelessness in a nutshell. 😡 | Poslední aktualizace výrazně přidala funkce které mi chyběly, dokonce se zdá, že aplikace už zase správně reflektuje mnou ohlášené reklamy. Vývojáři udělali poradny kus práce se zdá! | Worst ever experience with banking app. Slow, buggy, so bad UX. | it's always hard to find what I am looking for. Some features are missing completely. | awesome | velmi užitečná a jakž takž přehledná aplikace | Zbytečný se s Vámi o něčem bavit, nejen že nemám kvůli Vám přístup k penězům na zaplacení jediného účtu co mi zůstal, budu radši když všechno ruším a běžte do pr..e. Volat ze zahraničí protože jste daly na trh něco co nefunguje a já jako zákazník přes 20 let jsem teď omezená ve využívání služeb. Tohle je Váš paskvil a ne můj! Vyhozený peníze za vývojáře a nový apky co je horší než verze předtím. Hnus Veroniko a chci to zrusit vsechno jenze nemuzu kreteni podelany!!!!!! | Má potenciál dobre aplikace, ale bohužel jedno velké mínus. Všechny banky které umožňují okamžité platby to již nastavili do svých aplikací jako výchozí automatická možnost pokud okamžitá platba je umožněna. ČSOB sice okamžité platby umožňuje ale musíte si to vždy zvlášť zaškrnout a nezapomenout na to. Už jsem si takhle zbytečně několikrát zablokoval peníze... | Snazim se odeslat platbu, ale opakovane dostavam chybu 403 | Idealni, funkcni, spokojenost. | Príšerné! Vnucují mě instalaci dalších aplikací pro rozšíření sledování. Nemám co schovávat, ale znemožňují mě používání mého účtu a mých peněz! | Jsem spokojen, aplikace funguje jak má, zatím žádný problém. | Bug report: Refreshing / pulling down on the dashboard often gets stuck, spinner spinning indefinitely. | chybi podrobnější analýza výdajů. | Dobrá aplikace, platby jsou jednoduché, a skoro vše mohu vyřídit v aplikaci. Biometrika čtečkou prstů velmi usnadňuje přihlašování a potvrzení plateb. Jedna věc, která by mohla být vylepšena je funkce grafu v sekci finance, jelikož data jen za poslední kalendářní měsíc mi(osobně) nejsou moc užitečná. Raději bych si nastavil přesný rozsah období, nebo měl dostupno více než posledních 30 dní. | Aplikace funguje dobře, má hodně možností, jen je dost pomalá. | fakt jednoduchá,rychlá,přehledná applikace.***** | Aplikace dělá nevyžádané transakce na můj účet!!/application does unsolicited transactions on my account!!, ikdyz sama píše, že transakce neproběhla a skončila chybou a pak transakci 5x zopakuje!!!/it repeats transactions even if the original transaction failed!!! Nechápu, jak tomuto někdo říká El. bankovnictví. Když sama aplikace manipuluje s mým účtem a mojimi penězi bez mého vědomí!!!! Update : Po konzultaci s helpdeskem se jedná o chybu v aplikaci, o ktere ČSOB velice dobře ví. | Jen aktivovat tuhle aplikaci trvá hodinu, pokud víte, jak na to, jinak déle. Vynucuje si svolení k věcem, které nepotřebuje, některá povolení není možná vůbec ovlivnit. Uživatelsky velice nepřátelská. | Apps keep crashing with unknown error, can't use for banking | confusing app, but we have no choice but to use it | Login error, app error, every time, I'm tired of this app, it does not work at all. | Táto aplikácia by pokojne mohla byť jednou z desiatich rán egyptských. Nefunguje v nej vôbec nič a ak áno, tak len na chvíľku. Keď zadávate platbu vždy tŕpnete či vás to nevyhodí na chybovú obrazovku, čo znamená, že so svojimi peniazmi už viac narábať nebudete. Po reinštalácii sa SmartKey aktivuje cez Identitu na ktorú treba SmartKey. Bomba. A každá z iných možností reaktivácie vyvolá chybové hlásenie. A tak som v Thajsku odrezaný od svojich peňazí. EDIT: To som už skúšal. Nefunguje Vám ani to. | Kdybych mohl dát jednu hvězdičku 10x udělal bych to. | horrible but works when it needs to i guess | Decent | Spyware included. 👎 | Vcelku se to dá, ale má to ""moderní"" vzhled s hromadou prázdného místa, takže se na obrazovku nic nevleze. | Jste zblaznili nebo co? Z jakeho duvodu hcete se hrabat v mem telefonu? V zadnem pripade to nedovolim a radej prejdu do jine banky. Takze po skoro 20 letech odchazim. | All good | Very poor interface... 99 % of Internet banking functionality is missing. I will change my main banking app. | Aplikace neumožňuje dělat si pro své účely snímky obrazovky. Ale teď už i buzeruje a omezuje můj soukromý telefon a vyhrožuje, že pokud neodinstaluji aplikaci My Phone explorer, která mi zalohuje telefon, synchronizuje, atd, takže se nespustí. A teď ještě mám dávat k dispozici ZADARMO já této bance údaje o sve poloze, IP adrese, seznamu nainstalovaných aplikaci i v případě, že jejich app nepoužívám, to už považuji za teroristický čin.

Dále bych chtěl možnost neuvádět na faktuře reklamní sdělení airbank a poslední asi nereálný požadavek je propojení s podnikatelským účtem v jiné bance. | No English option, it's been years, when are you going to swallow your nationalistic pride and make the app more accessible? | New review: Coming back to this review after years. I have tried them and after two weeks of using their bank account I had to call my lawyer to help me out cancel this bank. Fraud and anti-human approach.

Vše je jednoduché a intuitivní. | Aplikace je sice intuitivní, ale několikrát týdně celý večer až do rána nepoužitelná kvůli výpadkům a údržbám. Je sice fajn, když je o bankovnictví staráno a řeší se různé zabezpečení atd, ale k čemu to je, když je to na úkor toho, že několikrát týdne nezaplatím vůbec nic. Tohle mě nutí uvažovat o změně banky, protože jsem kvůli tomu několikrát nemohl platit přes bankovnictví důležité platby a to klidně i v 7 večer. | Sadly not available in English | It can be even better if they add English language as like in other Czech bank apps | So far everything has been perfectly smooth. | Excellent application, responsive, and very well designed. Quite a few changes to the layout as well, constantly getting upgrades. 10/10 | Aplikace funguje skvěle, pro uživatele velmi přehledná a vše je tam kde má, jen mi zamrzelo, že není možnost screenshotu a přes to, že vlastním Galaxy S23 Ultra se zabezpečením Knox.

Very good app. (Velmi přehldná aplikace). | Stupid and excessive security measures which are difficult to use and conform to. The new ""follow your eye"" feature is beyond assanine and doesn't work. Frustrated as hell. Despite knowing ALL information, cannot register my new phone without traveling 3,000 miles to Prague to a branch. Airbank keeps parroting ""security"" as the reason, but NO OTHER BANK in the world does this nonsense!!!! REPLY: even using Internet banking, the device STILL insists on using follow the eye feature. | Musím říct, že to je dobře zpracovaná aplikace. Možná ještě jedna věc by se hodila - při výpočtu zbývajících peněz po odečtení trvalých plateb přidat možnost něco jako ""virtuálních trvalých plateb"" - tzn. Když vím, že se mi měsíčně automaticky strhávají peníze za službu XYZ, tak abych si mohl nastavit, že se v ten den nejspíš strhne daná platba, a tudíž by se pak tyto platby mohly taky odečíst od zbývajících peněz. | Very intuitive interface | Very happy | Málo intuitivní, uživatelsky velmi nepřívětivá app - nejčastěji používané funkce a info má být na jeden klik, místo toho vám na hlavní stránce nacpou prodejní prostor pro hypotéky, pojištění a další služby (i ty které od nich už máte).

Pls | Good app for promotional offers. | Po každom spustení sa vypne so správou že si mám odinštalovať aplikáciu Anydesk. Aplikáciu som si nainštaloval sám a potrebujem ju k práci. | Funguje velmi dobře. Jako jedinou výtku bych viděl to, že si nemůžu přidat předplatné (např. Hbo, netflix) do pravidelných plateb a tudíž se mi nepočítají do budoucích výdajů. | Jedna s nejlepších bankovních aplikací jaké jsem kdy viděl. Naprosto super!! Jednoduchá, intuitivní, ale se všemi funkcemi. | Skvěle fungující, propracovaná a moderní aplikace. | Velmi dobrá appka. Používám na jak na ovládání účtu, potvrzení transakcí. Zároveň nakupuji zahraniční pojištění pro sebe a blízké. Vše velmi jednoduše. | Přešel jsem z nejmenované údajně ""klientsky nepřívětivější žluté banky, která pokračuje služby v Rusku"", se kterou jsem měl léta problémy. Aplikace jako samotná je v mnoha ohledech lepší, banku bych tu hodnotil neměl, avšak prozatím si nemohu stěžovat. | Po změně telefonu na ROG Phone 6 nezaostří QR kód. Jinak super appka. | Po několika měsících útrap s nepřehlednou aplikací Raiffky poté, co mi zrušili Equabank, kde jsem byla spokojená, mě aplikace Air bank naprosto nadchla. Chválím dark mode jako výchozí nastavení a celkově krásně intuitivní ovládání, kdy jsem už první den byla schopná s novým mobilním bankovnictvím bez problému fungovat. Díky za skvěle odvedenou práci :) | Easy | Pěkná aplikace, ale na dětské verzi nefunguje detail karty, aplikace spadne. Odzkoušeno u dvou dětských účtů na dvou různých zařízeních. Už je vše ok 👍 | Need English language. | Aplikace prohledává uložiště telefonu i přes výslovný zákaz. Škoda, dříve jsem byl spokojený, dokonce i reklamy v aplikaci jsem překousl, chápu, musí se vydělávat a toto je jedna z cest. Ale to co dělá teď, je brutálně přes čáru. Základní důvěra mezi bankou a zákazníkem byla porušena=důvod pro změnu banky. Co je vám do toho co za aplikace si instaluju do telefonu? Vidím vaše reakce u ostatních komentářů, chápu že tu jsou ""podvodníci"" atd.. ale vy snad děláte služby jen pro bezsvéprávné lidi? | Katastrofická sprosťárna po poslední aktualizaci: Nevypnutelné vnucování toho co smím mít na svém mobilu. Bylo přidáno vyhledání aplikací v mobilním telefonu, které by mohly být škodlivé při použití MyAir. Nalezené podezřelé aplikace jsou opakovaně oznamovány na všech nárožích a vnucována je jejich odinstalace. Opakování této nabídky a notifikaci nelze vypnout. Skenování telefonu proběhne bez svolení uživatele. Prostě sprosťárna. MyAir začínám používat minimálně. Odmítám opakovanou buzeraci. | User friendly | Nepřehledná. Hlavní stránka je jedna velká reklama která mě nezajímá a nejde odstranit. | Zatím dobrý | Je to spyware | Spolehlivá, přehledná aplikace, mám 2 výhrady: 1) Po přihlášení se hodně těžko hledá mapa bankomatů, nejrychlejší je se odhlásit a otevřít ji z přihlašovací stránky. 2) Hodila by se mi možnost nastavit více upozornění. Většinu financí si nenechávám na běžném účtu a nehlídám ho denně, takže bych využila upozornění typu ""zůstatek klesne pod"". Zároveň se mi ale hodí i upozornění na příchozí platby nad X Kč, když někdo zaplatí fakturu. | Great and easy to use app | zkoušel jsem hodně bank a tato appka je top | App is not working anymore, my money is still in your bank, now i have to travel 100 km to nearest branch... | Ok, it does the job. | Přehledná aplikace | Missing English mutation | I like it 😊 | Nejlepší banka :) Jen pár připomínek k mobilní aplikaci. 1) Chybí uložení stavu před automatickým odhlášením. Například při delším psaní důvodu při uplatnění záruky spokojenosti, se aplikace odhlásí a text se bohužel ztratí. 2) Registrace obličeje by měla být umožněna i v manuálním režimu, tzn. zmáčknutím spouště. Taktéž by mělo být vypnuto zrcadlení fotografie. Kvůli těmto dvoum nedostatkům je proces zdlouhavý a nepříjemný, s mnoha pokusy. 3) Mapa poboček a ATM by měla být rychle přístupná. | Chyba byla opravena. Asi něco s android 13. | Working very well, only thing I miss is the Sepa pay order, it should be automatically included, for example, we are using only sepa in Austria, even for domestic payments and works like a charm 🙂 | Hezká banka | The best bank service in CZ | Please, add English language as an option! | Super easy | Great | Banga | They don't speak English in the bank branches, but mobile app My Air is the best. easy to use even in Czech and i am using it more then 4 years. | Does not have English, but otherwise, very good. | It would be great if the app could support English! Otherwise it's very easy and handy | Try to give English version | Application works fine. Doesn't hang up. Only problem for me personally is lack of English language as option, however with icons I am able to work with it. There are some less friendly functions but it's not app fault, like 3h wait time after registering phone. Nicely made app. Never had issues with it. The design is pretty nice. You can save templates. Coupons are in there and auto apply to your card. You can login easily with fingerprint. QR code work miracles. Just please English. :-) | Nemožnost udělat screenshot, ale na iPhonu tato možnost je. Tudíž nechápu výmluvy o bezpečnosti. | Úžasné, rozhodně lepší jako Raiffeisenbank a jiné velké banky. | Potvrzení platby v internetovém bankovnictví potřebuje trochu doladit | Cool, thanks!!! | The app is very intuitive and it is easy to use. And I really like the dark theme. So much better than the white one which made my eyes hurt. Great app, keep it up. :) | Appka je prehledna a ma vse potrebne funkce. Nicmene AirBank casto vypina sluzby Internetoveho bankovnictvi a appku behem noci az do rana. Takze nemuzete platit ani kartou online, protoze 3D Secure vyzaduje potvrzeni pres appku. Na me opakovane prosby varovat o odstavkach predem alespon emailem, mi rekli, ze to neni mozne a ze to nechteji ani resit. Byl jsem klientem pres 10 let, ale ted odchazim kvuli teto lhostejnosti z jejich strany. | Probíhá ještě vývoj mobilní aplikace? NFC platby nefungují alespoň půl roku, přidání účtu jiné banky ani po 3 měsících z mobilu stále nejde. Připadám si jako tester a podle komentářů nejsem sám. Ani potvrzeni plateb nevyskakuje,, nerozumim k cemu je ta aplikace dobra | V porovnání s aplikacemi jiných bank je to prostě top | I am satisfied | Absolutely clear and easy to use. | Co jste to zase provedli. Po akrualizaci se není možné přihlásit prstem. Skvělé, tohle není poprvé... | user friendly, easy, simple | Nejlepší appka ever. | I do like the app and all available functionality. As non-Czech speaker I do find my way around. But I would give it 5/5 if they make it in EN version available. I recommend airbank to everyone I know and as expat,it includes a lot of foreigners who would then struggle with the app. | Ok | No support for english | Rychlé, přehledně, hodně informací na malém prostoru. Hvězda dolů za odměny, proč musím všechny zapínat manuálně, některé o opakovaně, navrch bez informace o vypnutí odměny. Značení výdajů do skupin si také zaslouží upgrade - pokaždé, když přeznačim výdaj se vrátím na začátek výčtu a pak musím znovu scrolovat dolů abych přeznačil další. Ocenil bych i možnost značení příchozích plateb (např když na dovolené řeším společné výdaje a kamarád mi pošle platbu zpět, toto už není zohledněno v přehledu) | Easy to use, fast and intuitive overview. | Nemám co vytknout. No complaints. | Aplikácia sa mi páči ale kategorizácia jednotlivých platieb nefunguje správne. Po rozkliknuti platby je možné kategóriu zmeniť, neskôr ale v grafoch je zobrazovaná pôvodná kategória, čím sa stávajú pre mňa grafy nepoužiteľné. Prosím o opravu | Great app, I have question please how to allow the screenshot on the app I can't make screenshot. | Nejvšestrannější bankovní appka | Oproti internetovému bankovnictví je mobilní AirBank mnohem modernější a použitelnější. Hodně mi ale chybí detailnější analýza historie. Například průměrné měsíční náklady seskupeny podle kategorií za zvolené období. Mít přehled o tom, kolik průměrně měsíčně zaplatím například za kategorii jídlo je podle mě jeden z nejdůležitějších údajů. Bohužel toto se z historie a grafů bez dodatečných výpočtů vyčíst nedá (lze vidět pouze jednotlivé měsíce zvlášť a nebo pak celkové náklady za rok) | Hezký aplikace. | 1) Extremely aggressive automatic logging off! I have hard time to create a payment with copying data from another app. Or writing a message to support is always a two step process with copy&paste. Very annoying! Nothing to do with security. 2) Half a year old app refuses to open and requests to be updated. That can be very inconvenient! There's no good reason and it's got nothing to do with security either. 3) No english support in the app. Very dumb. Excuses posted here by support sound silly. | Velmi dobrá aplikace přehledná jednoduchá ale funkcni | Používám aplikaci zatím jen chvíli, ale hned od začátku naprostá spokojenost. Aplikace je svižná a intuitivní a zvládám v ní dělat vše, co se svým bankovním účtem potřebuji. | Perfect, no problem at all. | Kdybych byla možnost angličtiny bylo b to nejlepší internetový bankovníctvi | Good bank, nice app. | Maximální spokojenost. | They need an English version. | Best mobile app on the market | Nafejovane,bumpnute reviews 5timi hviezdickami anonymnych userov (dnes lahko zistitelne - hamba vam). Apka je prezleceny AddWare bez anglickej podpory v 21 storoci.. Proste tragicke a nechutne obchodne praktiky. Naopak vas internet banking je jeden z najlepsich co je na trhu. Dcerska spolocnost pod ktorou to bezi vizera z tohto pohladu len ako pracka na prachy... | Výborná aplikace, rychlá podpora a zapracování připomínky do aplikace. Chybí jen možnost povolit/zakázat screenshoty v Nastavení (konkurence umí). | Super app | Aplikace je super splňuje mé očekávání. | Love it | Po resetování telefonu do továrního nastavení už mi nejde aplikace znovu nainstalovat na telefon, i když předtím jsem ji tam měla a normálně fungovala. Telefon je aktualizovaný a nikde se nedá dohledat v čem je problém. Teď jsem na internetu dohledala, že ta nová ""super verze"" je to pro android 4.4, já mám 4.3. Dá se někde stáhnout i starší funkční verze aplikace? V bankovnictví jsem fungovala především přes aplikaci... | July 2018: I opened ""small tariff"" accout, no monthly fees, about $5 fee for each international transfer. Just what I need for my trips between USA - CZ. Knowledgeable banker in Pilsen Republic Square branch, helped me to choose suitable account for me, no stress dealing - thank you. Smooth and pleasant experience. UPDATE 28.8.22 downgraded to 1 star.Personal don't care at Americka branch in Pilsen, messed up documents.Phone customer service is useless. | Hello, please translate the app into English or Ukrainian at least. It's a shame not to have any other language options than Czech. Surely, your clients are not just and only Czechs. And you are a bank so you can get some money and find professional translator(s) for the translation of this app without problems. | The ads are really stepping over the line in the latest update. QA is getting worse and worse - some animations look bad, colors are wrong... Also, English would be nice. Update: By ads I mean discounts for Albert, promoting your loans etc. Don't expect me to improve my star rating in foreseeable future then. 🙂 | Uzivatelsky prijemna aplikace | Žádné chyby nenalezeny. | Nelze nemít lock screen a jen aplikaci odemknout otiskem. Možná nedostatek v systému Android ale uživatelsky nepřijatelné. | Nejlepší bana . | All I need is at my fingertips | Absolutely love it, but would be great to have it in other languages too | Need English language for foreigners | Nejvíc a trvale mi vadí, že mě apka skoro vždy odhlásí, než stihnu něco dořešit, 2min timeout nelze změnit → proto jediná ★. Nelze zobrazit číslo účtu (pošli mi peníze) před přihlášením do aplikace. Banka nehlásí nedostupnost aplikace (při údržbě) předem formou notifikace, takže občas máte smůlu a nelze se chvíli přihlásit. EDIT: Nahrání PDF do šanonu apka nabízí, ale při nahrávání spadne. Crash report i zprávu z apky jsem poslal. Bylo: Neumí nahrát do šanonu PDF. Chybí vám čárka před „a to“. | velmi neuspokojivá zkušenost, je zřejmé, že vývojáři měli eminentní nezájem o kvalitu finálního produktu nebo zákaznickou zkušenost. Nikdy to vůbec nedoporučuji. | Add language change for the app. At least add English... | Nedaří se mi zapnout přihlašování otiskem prstu. Kliknu na přepínač, aplikace mě vyzve k přiložení prstu na čtečku, prst přiložím, dialog zmizí, ale přepínač zůstane vypnutý. | Šíleně složité propojení aplikace s účtem. V jiné bance jsem se přihlásila hned, zde je to zatím na X pokusů neúspěšné | Posledni dva updaty a aplikace pada a ani nenabehne. EDIT: zrejme to dela presun na SD kartu. Predtim to nedelalo a to aplikaci pokazde presouvam z nedostatku mista. | Super, easy to navigate...can do almost everything that is available online | If only an English version. Otherwise awesome experience | Notifikace o příchozích platbách vůbec nefungují. Všechno je správně nastaveno a stále nejdou.

I have A LOT of cards so it's handy to have them all in one place instead of having the mother of all purses of all the cards! You can also turn on notifications so that you go into a shop you have a card for so you don't forget to use it! | Easy place to find yr cards | Does not like my mobile number | It made my life easy to carry cards around | Suits me.

So what's the point in this app?! Not one card saved on there anymore. Pure garbage | Works well for storing card info, but too many notifications for things I am not interested in. | Very easy to access all my store cards in one app. | Îmi place mult că îți poți face cont și automat ai toate cardurile salvate online. | Not had one problem in 6 months of having it .am a contractor and only damage or lose my cards.

I love it ❤️ | handy app | Unbelievable app! 👌🏻 | Useful | Awesome app, very helpful | Fantastic app to store all your cards. Best part, the app will generate Specials on a weekly basis that is uploaded by the stores, eg. Checkers, PicknPay etc. Highly recommend. | Undescribable , Uncomparable,%100 meets my demands . Nothing But Praises to say the least .GETS THE JOB DONE ✅✅✅ | Very nice app.Frankly speaking, I have say no to my wallet. Very very good. | Ideal for reducing the size of the wallet | I've recently changed my phone and can't access the app at all. It keeps saying add a code that we have sent to your phone. No code has arrived. I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it so many times but still the same message. I've emailed Klana but still no joy. I just need a code but for some reason they can't find my details on their system Grrrr so annoying as I've got all my cards stored on this app. Can anyone help Please!! | This App Make life easier, no need to carry many cards anymore. | So convenient | App is really good but I hated somehow it enforces klarna signup. I recommended lots of people and now people got annoyed about sign up. | Very convenient | Great App, but when can we add out NZDL & other government cards? Been using this for a few years now. 👍👍👍 | Convenient | This app neither let me login into my old account, neither let me reset password, neither let me sign up in anyways. Why this app s#cks for android but works perfectly fine with apple. I am uninstall this app after this review. | Too many unwanted offers from retailers I don't have cards with. It is so annoying, there is no way to turn off notications or unwanted offers. | Great app. Help me move to a minimalist wallet. | Use it all day long at work. Included my overide cards. Great! | Awesome App! no need to ever carry loyalty cards ever again. Love it | Easy transaction | Very good | Honestly this is the best thing ever. | Easy and very handy to use. | Is always running in the background. Tries sending crashreports every 5 minutes when you don't allow background data usage, even when you restrict it... Is essentially a battery hog. An app of so simple function doesn't need such complications. Install something lighter, like Catima! | Great!! | Beautiful safe app | Probably the most effective app on the Playstore. It just works! | Useful | Great place to store cards instead of carrying round physical ones. | Easy to produce at checkout instead of trying to find the actual card. | So easy to use | Number 1 | It was working very well for me, but now all my cards on the watch are double. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with no difference. If I delete a card from the phone, ONE instance of it disappears on the watch. There doesn't seem to be an option to delete from the watch directly. I also found that if I uninstall it from my phone, one copy of each card disappears on the watch, but once I reinstall it, they double up again. Any help with this would be welcome. | Awesome, clever, easy 😀 | Great app, but I wish you could organise your cards into gift cards and non gift cards. A tab for both would be great. | Very easy and get everything on the phone | This app is absolutely amazing, I love it☆♡ | Useful | Works 100% | Great saves having to carry cards | Very much convenient and easy to use. Great app 👏 | Great app | Great app for storing all your membership cards | Love that all my store cards are in one location. If I don't have my wallet, they're all handy on my phone 👌 | Excellent for storing all your cards in one location. Convenient and cool way to manage all your loyalty cards. | Awesome | It was a great app. Now is constantly crashing. | This app has simplified my life, I no longer move around with my cards. | Good app, but forget about the much-mooted backup, which is dependent on signing up for Klarna. | Was using it for at least 5 years and it was ok but now its trash after last update(from Jan or Feb 2024): constantly crashing and android notifying me several times a day about Stocard crashing and not being stable. | Nice apps all my store card I put in same place and easy to use. Very helpful 👌 | Handy | Very useful app I love it... | Ok at storing card barcodes. Despite being in bedtime mode, it sent me a notification at 9:48pm for CVS ad. Deny this app notification ability | Does what it says on the tin | Very handy no need to carry different types of cards with you all your cards at one place | To many adds | awesome | Please consider choosing a card manager that allows exporting your data. Stocard does not. This app does what I want - store my cards so I can scan them in stores. It also does many things I don't want like persistently monitor my location. And Despite Stocard claiming it doesn't share my data with third-parties my app tracking protection says it keeps trying to do just that. | Keeps going ""unresponsive"" Ever since the Feb09 2024 update, constantly getting notifications the StoCard has become unresponsive. I do not allow apps notify, tired of useless dings like a Vegas slot machine. There is NOT ONE Single worthwhile notification from StoCard. I hate the flyers as well, 3/4 of them are irrelevant as I do not shop there... ever. Useless, useless update. | The latest version crash | E okay decât cu 8-10 carduri după tine mai bine un telefon și gata | Constantly crashing in the background even though it's not set up to run in background. | Very convenient | Не изисква лични данни, което е едно от най-добрите достойнства на шриложението, лсвен, че е супер удобно за съхранение на карти! | Marvelous | Makes life easier and my wallet lighter | I really enjoy using this app | Excellent app without ads. You wont regret to have this app | Very good & helpful | So easy to use | easy to use. can scan easily | Good wallet | Pity some of the suppliers don't get with the time. Great app! | Useful | Sooo handy | Since I used the application I don't have a problem when I forgot my cards at. I like this application because I can be able to access my cards even when I I am not connected to internet | This app is great to use it stores all your loyalty cards etc on your phone & is quick & easy to use. Very happy to have all those darn cards out of my back pocket. I strongly recommend this app to everyone. | Latest version crashing in the background. Feb 2024 | Great app | Functional | The latest update keeps telling me that there is a problem and tells me to uninstall and wait for the next update. Before the latest update, I had no problem with the app and used it all the time. | Convenient app | Keep up the good work. | It's great having all my loyalty cards in one place. Nice & easy | Easy, straight forward, efficient, smart. Just need time to take good card pictures....if you're fussy ! Best is that it is free ! | All scorecards in one place! Ideal for an impatient technophobe like me!! | Excellent concept, no more physical cards in my purse. I love the app. | brilliant app. so handy for keeping cards in one place. I use it almost daily | Very easy to use and maintain | Great helpful app | After the app was purchased by Klarna i start to have android notifications Stocard stop working. I had to uninstall the app because the notifications start to be annoying. | The app keeps crashing in the background, this happened to me before and i had to uninstall it for while (month or so). No the issue is back... | I don't need to carry so many plastic card So it's even save my pockets for being torn Please add ""identify clothing shop"" Thank you | Great idea, very useful | I like the ease of use, the fast uploads and having the cards I like in one place | Used this for years and never have to carry loyalty cards | Perfect | Best app for storing important documents. | This was so easy to do. Loaded cards from years ago too. Top of it all, my walley is not so damn thick any more.😁 | Haven't had any issues, makes it very convenient. | To many notifications | Love it! I don't need to carry any cards with me. | Easier than carrying around lots of loyalty cards. | Great easy way to shop love the idea I have fun using this app and have shared with my family and friends | Love this best wallet card and safe | Good Old fashioned service | Very good | This doesn't do anything but scan barcodes of plastic cards. It's pretty pointless. | So very handy and saves carrying a bunch of cards. Well recommended | I stopped updating this app 3 years ago. Still works. Always turn off automatic updates from g00gle play. I wont update apps that spy on activities & blast constant ads. This app makes you the product. Developers track your use & location. Turn off background data & location permission. *** UPDATE: A great, free, open-source, privacy friendly alternative that offers the same functions: Catima - Loyalty Card Wallet. The developer won't sell your data & won't blast you with ads. *** | Latest updates broken the app ""Good at phone BAD at Smartwatch"". The barcode on the smartwatch is very small and the scanners does arrive to read it. You need to use the phone but there are other option on phones like Google wallet. So if does not work for smartwatch (Samsung watch 4 and Fossil Gen 5 does not work anymore), the app is not useful for me anymore. Any aupdate to have as before? | Super easy to use and very convenient. | Love this app. Takes away the pain of carrying all my cards. | Very helpful app. One suggestion I would have would be to be able to manually sort cards. Frequency is helpful but unless the card is in your top 6-8 they jump all over the place and make it hard to locate between uses. | Great app. Keeps all your reward cards together on your phone so no need to carry them in your wallet. | Brilliant, no more cards | it is great to points | Beautiful app thanks a lot. | It's a great way to be able lighten the load of a wallet and just open the app and they're all there. If you have location available set to when using the app it will give you the right card. | Garbage offers keep popping up on trash I do not use or buy | Best one ! | An impossible feat, tell how the hell am I supposed to create a cards shortcut! Long pressing the icon gives me only 3 useless cards which I saved but don't use frequently. | Very useful more room in my wallet. | Love this app Love having all my loyalty cards in one place without having to lug them around. Bonus feature getting the latest flyers in the app to read | This app works very well for me! 👍 | Good card app | easy to use, and I don't have to carry my purse around any more ❣️ | Very convenient 👌 | Sensational | Awsome | Stocked is excellent | I can't delete companies that I will never use. To emphasize, I don't want offers from companies I don't buy from. It should be my choice, not Stocards. It is irritating getting these. | Very convenient. You don't have a wallet full of cards. | Easy to use. | Use to be good, but now getting ads.

It causes an array of issues including duplicate text messages, turning most of my conversations to 'group texts' with me as two of the participants and also just randomly assigns text messages to the wrong people. Ten resets and countless chats to Apple Support have resulted in no improvements. | Won't even download | Very good | Great app for me | Nice and good | Very average functioning of this app, fails a lot of time, only transfer option hence used, or people shouldn't waste time if there is a better competition | very disappointed with the downloading of the app | Super simple | Transfering data to ios 1 minute lasts 20 minutes already. | Worst experience keeps hanging n deletes data | This is good, why do you need my location. For this type of app.. don't you think it's a bit underwhelming your asking for the location. Of the device and not Seeing The Terms Of What it could cause?... Check the news it shows people go kidnapping everytime... Don't trust location leaking.. | Best app ever recommend to everyone | Only 10 percent transferred | very good | Jeder Versuch führt dazu, dass WhatsApp abschmiert, schade. Wenn ich keine Alternative finde, werde ich das IPhone wieder zurück geben, weil ich nicht bereit bin, meine letzten 10 Jahre Chatverläufe zu verlieren. | What is this massagev before the end of the day ahead you like so you do the best for the needful and confirm with him in one library system for all of the day. | It took 5 hours. I selected all the files to be moved but at the end only 30% were transferred. | Will not connect to Samsung A53 | WhatApp tip: if you get stuck at 40% with ""Something went wrong"" , go to Settings > iCloud > Backup, scroll down until you see Whatsapp and turn it off and retry. Found on a reddit post, hope this helps someone else too. Good luck folks, this is a buggy mess. It ended up picking some random number from my contacts as my main contact information too 🙄 | Apple put the bare minimum of effort into this app. | Not working.. oppo Reno 6 5g to 12 mini. Tried many times.. Took over night until next day morning then failed.. Apple give me a solution.. | Would not transfer the phone over | Traing to my iphone | Works well. | I don't own an apple device, so I was really excited to make my Android tablet into a resemblance of an iPad. However, you need to own an ios device to be able to even work the app. If you don't have a Apple device of some sort, then I don't recommend this app at all. | This app is Good . | Unable to use app.Vode not coming | IOS ANDROID | Pesimo, no traslada los datos | It was crazy! They had me try new things I had'nt seen before! (PS: It was kinda good:) | Fast and efficient | It's superrr slowww! Make sure you have a whole day to wait on the transfer data. Mine says it will took about 4 hours, but its been 13 hours now and it stucks at ""About 7 Minutes to go"". I probably have to cancel since i need to go to work and disconnect from my home wifi. | Very slow and inconvenient for iphone 15 | Incredible! | Great | Good | Every single detail of my WhatsApp account and other apps were transferred to Apple device perfectly. I strongly recommend this way of switching from Android to Apple. Thankyou Apple and Google. | Great | Even apps available in apple app store are not downloaded completely , offline audio didn't get transferred , worst app | Good | 👍 | Yup | Stay on android | Spyware for communist | Struck at 40 percent | Very nice app.This is best platform for trading | When I was moving my WhatsApp chats it gave me an error message and didn't restore any of it. For sure my next phone will be an android. | Good | Not working at all | good apps👍 | Photos Contacts Messages WhatsApp Successfully done 👍🏻 | Okay | MESSAGE TRANSFER PROBLEM- If your messages are not transfering properly you have to download a 3.2 version of move to ios. The fact that the newest version is so buggy is ridiculous! | Cook | Worthless app would not recognize iPhone right next to it ....have to install and transfer by hand App SUCKS!!!! | Good | Ios | Terrible app. Do not use! They need to fix this. | I erased my iphone 3 times in a row while trying to move my WhatsApp data it says something went wrong on 40% Unable to move WhatsApp data to IOS, it's still a nightmare... Total waste of time with this Move to IOS | Good | To many questions. | Please don't sell my information . | Nice | Doesn't clearly tell you the process in order to move files from Android to Apple.... Lacking in clear detail! | Just goes back a day forth with the same questions and won't go any further, garbage. | I don't know what to think about it. | Shittiest app ever, don't know why these guys have created it when it doesn't work AT ALL. Starts fine but the transfer never ends and right when its about to complete gets stuck | Good | I would give more stars but don't know how to use it | What'sapp transfer gets stuck after 80% | You can only do it when you first set up your iPhone. I used my iPhone for a while then switched to an old Android. Now that I'm trying to go back to the iPhone, it won't work. This app isn't on the iPhone app store. | Ywiu | Come on!! I erased my iphone 3 times in a row and in WhatsApp app when I'm moving chat ""something went wrong"" aptrears on 40% of loading. 3 times in a row!!! | Tried day -2 spent so much time -it is even not bother download -said will install soon-2days not soon enough? Also no code other phone need to have for connection? Restarted devices few times checked all -nothing changed😩 | this will just crush your phone so do NOT download it | Good | Doesn't transfer texts over to iPhone properly, it combined lots of non group texts into group texts | Bad app my phone was about to die and it didn't want to transfer my data because it was a low battery and it died and i couldn't get my data | Can you please add the feature of transferring WhatsApp Business data transfer from Android to iOS. It will be really helpful. | wouldn't let me pass allowing it permission even when every permission has been allowed | Buuuuuu!!! | HOW TOVRATE iOS mean good or not good? | It is user friendly | Doesn't work. | Lost all the WhatsApp chat history after converting phone number to new number, and using esim on new iPhone. Won't restore after it said backup was successful. Also lost Gmail password after number change | Google account | Please don't use this app, it's not reliable at all. | I would give zero stars if I could. This can only transfer data to an iPhone during the initial setup. If the iphone is in use already the only way is to reset the iphone and start over. What the hell apple? | ... what's next ... | Sorry i switched to apple... I will again switch to android... Worst experience... Can't move my data.. | Fist time using very 👍 | Recent app problem with time' and other issues please help me. Thank you 👍 so | Asked for a code but iPhone doesn't show it | A disaster. This app isa shame. It jumps directly to ask for a code whitout entering any detail to what phone i am movi g my data | Good luck | Smooth | The app itself is fully functional, used it to copy data between my iPad and my Nexus 7, the only reason I rated it 5stars. But for those of you Android fanboys(I'm one, too), you guys need to know when to shut up. iOS and Android are two different platforms. Get over it! And for the Apple fanboys out there, Android has security that's pretty advanced compared to iOS's security. The algorithms and all are very complex. Its the users themselves that make Android less secure. But, back to the app, it works :D | Do not buy iPhone. You will never be able to transfer chats from android to iPhone. | Seriously been stucked at ""about 5 minutes"" for centuries, why is it so difficult to move chat, multimillion dollar company with low end app, you guys couldn't care much I see. | Frustrated to the core.. Never works.. Only time and effort spent are waste.. | Shame on Apple. Cant transfer my data without resetting everything in my Iphone. | This ap so sick I like this app | Good | Failed twice. Only 70% of apps have been transferred and unfortunately WhatsApp transfer didn't work. Quite painful experience. I am already regretting my change to iOS - Android is more compatible. | App keeps crashing | The app sucks.. could not transfer what's app | Stuck at 40% always.. tried more than 50 times | За 4 часа ожидания не перенесли почти ничего | Thank You | Terrible Stuck at ""Something went wrong"". A multibillionar company but still get this error. Quit your job. | Don't remember. | worst apo ever used , why do jave to make moving to you so much harder 😂, one hour in this app means 6 hours in real life | Best | Doesn't work | automatically free | Worst experience with this app, tried more than 2 times and wasted around 3-4 hours each time. Still I am unable to move the data. Always getting Import error ""something went wrong"" | The WhatsApp transfer doesn't work at all. Always stops at 40% and you can never resume it. | Very easy to follow | Nothing Ew I don't like it 😭 | did it's job | Great | 🙈 | Works perfectly. Reading the reviews here, I have the feeling, the problem might be in front of the screen. | All data switch to iPhone | love it | Single coda | It won’t download! | Idk | This is not better app For your mobile This app is very app dirty app | I can say this app is great. I moved everything first time, including over 2000 photos and videos, in 3 hours, but photos were scattered. So I moved again everything without photos and uploaded photos from drive. WhatsApp didn't move, but I found a solution. I used old iPhone to move WhatsApp on it and upload it to icloud and then just installed it on my new iPhone. I can now say that I wish I had moved to an iPhone earlier. | I am lucky bc when i,m 13 I am not getting a iphone i saw 1 star so DO NOT GET THIS APP | Doesn't work at all unfortunately | Bad | It's bad! I've never faced such terrible slow service in transferring files from android to android. I tried more than 10 times to transfer the files from my android to iphone but all failed. I cut down the items that I need to transfer to only transferring WhatsApp also failed. Goodness. If I know this apps is so bad I might as well just stick with Android.. Fed up. | it work!!!😄 | Whatsapp is not at all shown when iam trasnferring from one plus 6 to iphone 15. Why this problem exists? Looks like my phones satisfies all the version criteria | i factory reset my new iphone 4 times trying to get this app to copy whatsapp, it goes to 40% and crashes waste of time and effort | Very good I think these apps are fake I look into the app store and it's Play store all a long | The app doesn't work at all :( | اصلا نمیارع | Total time wasting app. Only works if WhatsApp is not selected. How can Apple possibly release a broken app onto the market. I have spent hours trying to get this to work, but it keeps on getting stuck on the 9 minutes left mark. | Maybe 20% of the apps moved | Not support | Awesome | تطبيق سئ لا يعمل. Bad app i don't recommend | I never had an iPhone. No idea where this app came from. | it doesnt work | Not effective | Apple needs to fix this app. There are too many complaints in the feedback of bad experiences. It took me 3 days to eventually get it to move my items, and even then, I still lost chat history with family and friends on Whatsapp. VERY annoying! | Waste of time not working | Cant download move to ios on i phone or get one time code to insert in android device | Awesome | Muy nice | Please stop encouraging children to bully other children into using Apple products. | ชอบมากเลยค่ะระบบปฏิบัติการณ์AppleIOSขอบคูณค่ะ | Good | Android better | The worst.... transfer. not successful even after 48 hours of trying. Too much. | I think it's OK with you Sent | Hard to use. No explanation | Rubbish app. After migrating for so many hours. In the end telling you import error especially for WhatsApp. | really why do you need my location everyone all in ya busness lucky this is a bogus e account with a fake vpn location | Bykali crashes. Tension!!! | WhatsApp transfer doesn't work | Why the heck does this need location permission! If iOS supports google account linking why do we need this for anything other than sms backup? | Pathetic application, please do not waste your time. | SO disappointed. Its been 2+ days rn. I have reset the phone multiple times just to TRY get all of my contacts + messages. Somehow only some chats were saved but some of my oldest were completely wiped. I'm gonna try again and I have no energy to try get all my msgs...I've tried so hard to delete as much as I can but it makes no difference. I never had this issue on Samsung. It doesn't even send me a code to start the process bcs I've tried too many times so it makes me wait even longer !! | I got it to do Absolutely nothing | Md misba kahn | This app just stuck at pending. IDK why it stucks at the pending word. Help me | stuck on 1 minute remaining time for an hour, I've tried cancelling and retrying to transfer but the same everytime | because I like this | It’s great | Perfect | It's not working at all | Helps us to work the I phone | This is an amazing application. Really very nice app. | Transfer half over to the iphone only.

Android auto, it's so bright that you have to manually dim the screen which is rubbish. | A+++ The more you use it, the better routes it gives you. The best part about the app is the user base being in real time. All we need is a heads up to what's going on ahead of us, and you've executed that 100%. After Trapster, there really hasn't been a maps as helpful. You guys save lives. Actually, the user base saves lives. Thank you all who interact and use waze. We can only make it stronger (no subscription plz.) Seems like that's the direction companies are going. | Good app | Pls back the car option | Hi, ive recorded my wife voice but cannot use it..why ehhh??? Update ( fast response to solve the issue..lebiu gaiss lahh.. 👍👍👍👍) | This is osam app | Alishahg | Prior to the last revision/update this has been a great app to use. However with the built in changes the at is useless now. Unable to get live updates on traffic since the last application update. | For over 24 hours now, my Waze is not wirking, saying connecting to GPS and after 30 secs, not connecting with GPS.. my Samsung phone is fine, Locator on and I even cleared the Cache for the app, this is now ridiculous and I live in the UK - England | Very helpful. Thanks a lot. | Ever since google picked up the app, the routes have been ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE... They ruined the best navigation app on the market 😢 | After update it delete all my favorites Not cool at all | Brand new to the app but I am really enjoying it. | Best application its actually better than google map | Stupid | Bring Master Chief back. Or solid snake | It's a great app i have been using for some years now. The problem i have is it doesn't seem to be coordinated with my Android Auto. It randomly opens in day mode when all my settings (phone & head unit) are on night mode. | It's great for navigation and its also great if you don't know the area. | I have been on Waze for years but now it is painful. I have an Android and it won't connect all the time and just says no connection. Please help | I like it as an alternative. But to find a distance between two points is much easier with Google maps. Waze needs to improve its live location sharing as well. Sometimes you just want to find the distance between two points, either for yourself or for relatives of friends to travel from one point to the next and Waze's route planner does not make that easy. | Gob | Ok,fine | Gyat | Best map app I've ever used the hazzard and traffic reports are great and directions are perfect keep up the great work | Why nowadays cant search the address we save as favorites have to search at saved tab. And the traffic route became worst than before. | Works great! | Waze is so much better than it's competitors, unfortunately it is not that much used, so the traffic data is not that great, but being able to schedule your trips ahead and get estimate for when to leave is a great feature others miss. Possibility to report and receive warnings is really useful too, wish the community was larger. | App frequently gives wrong directions such as saying turn north on a street that is one way south. | EDIT: After contacting customer support, they're of no help, and my issue still isn't resolved. 😡 I've lost some of the different hazard reporting options, such as animals on the side of the road, roadkill, and missing signs. What happened? 🤷🏻‍♀️ | It all works me all the updates are great improvements. It would be really nice to have heads up display connection.***** | Brilliant kit | Can't Mark rad closures on android auto which is disappointing and probably the most helpful warning. | good, thank you | Talks too much and too long | Was working great till the recent update.. for some reason... it no longer vocally tells me about speed traps or red light cameras.. it pops up on the screen... but voice... maybe android auto is the issue... will wait and see. | My biggest issue is that in Android Auto, there is no way to display the turn list. Would be nice to be able to look at a list of upcoming turns. Also, it would be nice to be able to select that turn and have options to avoid it. Or say that the road it closed or something like that. | This is my go-to app for navigation because of all the ones this gives me the real-time information I need. | With the new interface everything is Large leaving no space for the map (note 4). I live in London so with an always there camera / roadworks banner there is barely any space left for me to see the map in landscape. Can we have a condensed view to shrink banners and text size as well an immersive mode. I would like a few features make it into waze 1)EV car mode , Eco route and Charging stations locations. 2) heads up display mode can be added. 3) automatic integration with Google now. | Audio too low. Have to set volume level very high and can't have music playing. | It's a good app but they don't have a bike mode | Best navigation I love waze 👍👍 | Best map for UAE need to update which road track to follow on turn and roundabout not showing which track to follow if make this update sure this app will be one top for sure. | This app makes GPS fun! Lots of options and is accurate. So if you want to have a fun time while on the road and don't want to listen to the normal GPS narrators then grab the Waze Navigation App and take your driving to the next level. It has tons of voices to choose from. Tons of themes from all across the board. You can change your car and it even gives you points. Tells your MPH and feels the same as normal GPS but upgraded. So do your self a favor and head to the play store and grab WAZE!!! | Used to be excellent, but it's been disappointing recently. Full of bugs, with ridiculous maximum distance limitation (won't work for routes of more than 1000km), and questionable algorithm. It used to remember the favorite routes, now it doesn't. Android Auto version is extremely slow. I used to be a beta tester but since beta became alpha and final version feels like early beta I've given up. There are many better alternatives. | I like waze. Very customizable. Can change car icons and a lotta voices to choose from. It also uses way less battery than Google maps does. I don't get the lown rating for it. | Been using Waze for about 13 years. Several weeks ago I noticed it was taking forever to load, so I would switch to Google Maps. I finally decided to wait for Waze to load and discovered, to my chagrin, that all of my recents and saved places were gone. I checked my account and confirmed that I was still logged on. I've been using Google Maps every since. | I love Waze...What a great app!! | Why not connected or shared with my car screen? And if you add satellite mode also it's better. | Ecto 1 and Ray Stantz, you win Waze take my 5 stars | Greatest | Dont use IT IS bad | Enjoy using this app | I cannot used voice commands when using android auto in my Mazda 6. When I hit a destination that it searches for it just spins, never navigates. I even upgraded my phone and it still happens. Fix it! | Great after recent upgrades | Trash | After the last update, it won't announce red light or speed cameras for some reason. I've checked all the settings, voice is turned on, and the sound is on. It's the basic voice and announced them previously to the update please advise. | NEW REPORT FUNCTION SUPER SUCKS.CANT PUT DESCRIPTION.NO MORE ""ROADKILL""&""LATER"" OPTION, IF DUN SUBMIT IN TIME IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY SUBMIT&CANT EVEN PRESS ""BACK"" AFTER CHOOSING 1, SO GOTTA REDO MEANING THE REPORT LOCATION WONT EVEN BE ACCURATE. A SUPER DOWNGRADE WTH???NO ROUTE OPTION FOR ""LEAVE LATER"". NEVER TRUST THE ETA FOR 2 STOPS. not even showing my road report sometimes.EXTRA TOLL ROUTE WITHOUT MY CONSENT AGAIN DISGUSTING GROSS🤮SHOW ONLY 1 TOLL BUT ENDED UP 2 | Why it suddenly stop giving me a warning about the AES speed trap camera? I got summons 3 times yesterday because of it.. | Good | best Nav app about by a country mile !! live tracking for traffic, alerts (police) , live reports from other drivers ! & im not even getting paid for this feedback ! haha | Searching still lacking. But directions are pretty accurate. And at least the app can be used with Android Auto which seems to be a big problem with Google Maps. It's ridiculous you have to download third party apps because parent companies are too worried about social issues to get their services working properly. | Can't use downloaded custom voices even though I can hear them just fine when I check the individual recordings and the default I have set keeps switching back to Amy. I've restarted the app, cleared the cache, un-installed and reinstalled but nothing helps. Also, bring back Master Chief but that's less important. | Keeps sending wrong Directions | My daughter tells me the directions while using this app. Showing it is an easy to use app. Now, I don't have to worry about when she is older and looking for direction. The app logo and name are unforgettable. It's very easy to worry about if you are going in the wrong direction but not with Waze. I just have to say Waze Slays with every single 1 or 0 thay used in their code SLAY | Good | I've been using Waze for several years, and I like it. After the last update, though, the voice instructions stopped coming through my car's sound system. The phone is connected though Bluetooth, the audio system works fine, and the voice instructions do play on the phone's internal speaker. | I used to absolutely love waze and still love some features, however, waze with android auto is absolute trash. The fact that i cannot type an address in at all to find a place is so aggravating. It actually has become a bigger safety risk because using voice to find a place rarely works and causes me to be forced to focus longer on the stupid screen. Im forced to use a different nav app because I can actually type the address in via my phone. Lord forbid you have to go to multiple places. | Love ""go through this light and turn at next."" Would appreciate notice if place is on left or right. Sometimes takes me in a circle or give incorrect directions. Overall great App! | I love the warnings about hazards and police reports. Unfortunately that doesn't out weight the wrong destinations and the abrupt turning directions. | Good traveling app | Unreliable, worked well this morning on my outward journey. On my return it set a route, started giving me directions and then the route disappeared! Perhaps it is Android Auto at fault? | Always interup when using with grabcar apps | Love this app.It even tells you when a cop is nearby | Waze is by far my favorite navigation app, but the most recent update of either Waze or Android Auto removed the Waze tile from my choices of apps. Please fix the integration. I use a Galaxy 24 Ultra, and I drive a 2021 Audi Q5. I'm not on Facebook, so I can't follow up with you on messenger as suggested in other replies. | For some godawful reason this app closes itself if you change apps. Drives me insane. This alone makes it half as good as it should be otherwise. | The app itself is good , and it got better on the last upgrade ( i coult just touch one buton that was on screen already and see all routs on map ) it lasted for a few weeks , now is back to that old route display ... | Kind of works, but as soon as there is even a little bit of traffic it's ETA is completely off. Very unreliable app. | Waze | Night mode is gone. No matter what I only get day mode. My phone is set on dark mode and I set Waze for dark mode as well..... Still day mode. When I go into the menu items it's in dark mode, but go back to the map.... Day mode! I don't need everyone seeing my glowing screen. Please help! | Great | Nice | Love the different route options | After the last updates my favorite places are not shown by default in the search list but I have to go to ""saved"" or search for their nicknames/aliases and the most used location (also one from the saved/favorites list) is not shown at all in the ""last locqtions"" that are now shown by default... If I have favorites I want to see them by default and pinned and not to search for them!! | I'm not a fan of the Waze interface. You've ruined what, was once, an amazing navigation app. What's up with Waze guys!! You ruined it! Why do you lead us into a traffic jam!!!!! Butterfly disappointed. Every time you you try Waze you find out why you avoid it!!!! | Done with Waze. HORRIBLE with directions!!!!!!! Waze will direct you into traffic. This app is only good for cops, extremely unreliable on directions, especially if you're in a time crunch. Deleting app and downloading the next best app. | This was my go to app. Google and I clashed. Lately I don't know what's going on with Waze.Use it on workdays.Monday I selected my work address and it gave me a different route so I took it as there was traffic. It took me to my last location I was at. when I realised I was shocked and I was super late,I thought maybe I made a mistake.I went to gym today from work that worked fine, but when I set it for home. it took me back to work. it was completely confused. Data was on,location on. | Great addition to the driving experience. | I THOUGHT GOOGLE CR-APS WAS THE WORST NAVIGATION ON EARTH!!!! I WAS WRONG!!!!! GOING BACK TO A FROM WAZES -5. Specially when using doordash doesn't even take you Completely to the destination. And I don't know who does more zigzaggs and circles. Out of the two... Both suck bad!!!!!!!! | Awesome | Can't open. Always says no network then Drops me out. Hasn't ever worked | I loved the app but there are a lot of roads missing, misplaced and all that. I would love to fix them but when i open it on pc it doesn't allow me. I would love to contribute but i don't know how. I had also fixed some roads on Google maps before. Besides that i really liked the interface. It doesn't lag or crash on my cheap phone. I really love it. | Very Good experience | Problem saving voice on waze Annoying. When I get an update saying there is an new voice when I try to set it it says ""problem saving voice"" | Taking 5 minutes to load when I punch in any address, my network is very strong and l have a big phone. So frustrating | Still have no traffic lights in their maps...they need to improve that! | Android Auto, You cant use text search when parked, Google maps allow it. Can't use phone that's locked. Auto night mode also doesn't work on Android Auto anymore. Routing is often poor to dangerous took me down single track lanes while in Devon when other A roads would have been just as quick. | Good | Phone-controlled night mode no longer works with Android Auto. Night mode controlled by my phone rather than when I use headlights was my primary reason for using Waze. That seems to have been disabled since a recent update. Now, there's zero reason to use Waze over Maps. There are lots of us with after-market radios in cars without ambient light sensors. What a waste. Is a GUI toggle switch too much to ask? | outdated map, the street is one way only, I even tried editing their map, they ignored me, also there was no active members in my country that could fix it for me, so there was only me with level 1 map editor account. It was 2 months ago and it's still not updated, bye I'm not gonna download your app ever again. | Great app. Lots of people using it so it's a really reliable tool for word of mouth information about speed cameras and traffic hazards. The police say it's not illegal by itself but intend to crack down on road users touching phone apps while driving, so please set up Google voice recognition to use the app when driving. You can report speed traps and other hazards hands free and voice command journeys. | ok | Keep disconnect and can't detact GPS | It is very useful during the city roads and a bit struggling in parking places | Most glitches are fixed. Occasionally wigs out after an update but it's mainly a different voice than I've chosen. Still haven't figured out how to see my friends I used to have on there. | Great | The experience is great! But we need the car icons back. | On Android Auto the map display continually changes between light and dark mode at random, regardless of what you have it set to in the settings in the Waze app. Please fix this issue. | Ony 1 star to get developers to notice. App needs an update where you can mark a specific location of a traffic incident (regardless of your own location) when I am driving. I can't open the app quickly enough to mark an accurate location of an incident. App is 5/5 tho use it everyday. | Will not work with my vpn. I bypass it on surfshark but it still won't function properly. Worthless to me now. | Great App tnx | Waze cannot detect country location like Manila Philippines.. | OMG..Please fix this!  I've left msgs on the dev forum, here, etc for 2 straight years now.  Starting with v.4.9.x to current, the “Android Auto” version of displaying distance to hazard is still not working.  v.102.x appears to have fixed it for the standalone app but not when connected to AA.  v.4.8.x and earlier still work.  If you touch a hazard icon on the screen in AA, it does nothing but on the app it will say for example, “Car stopped 0.5 miles away “.  Please please re-add this to AA! | I enjoyed this app for a while...and it was quite useful...however, it has become less useful over time....the past year it frequently routes incorrectly or says the fastest way is ""x"" (but the reality is that there is a way 20 minutes faster). It also progressively is allowing less privacy controls while saving information like where I park. No thanks Waze.....goodbye my friend | I've been using Waze for years, and I have loved it. I use it daily and save 10-15 minutes each way, on average. The ETAs are usually very accurate. For the past year or so, the routing hasn't been as good. If I ignore it and go my usual route, the ETA drops a couple of minutes. Also, it has been changing the route while I'm driving, sometimes right at an intersection or highway exit, without any notification. Since the latest update, it is often not showing my saved names on the recent history. | Excellent used 10 years best ever! | It's an ok app needs offline mode for android auto I have wireless android auto and it don't work | More info than regular map app! | Excellent platform good directions .great for information on hazards etc | Absolute disaster, i found in inbox some alert saying today road closure! What today? It seems very old alert, not saying which date, but saying today every day! But when I wanted to submit this nonsense as report an issue and submitting feedback I couldnt submit nowhere except here! | Missing the master chief voice.one of my favourite voices on the app | Beautiful app a must have for every motorists | All good | It is pr, | The navigation is far superior to Google maps. The crowd sourcing of info for delays and rerouting is great. But, when using with Android Auto it ignores my settings for fastest route and changes to shortest route even when that is significantly longer. Also route details can't be viewed when using Android Auto. | I like this app better than regular maps | Love it | Most Android devices today use gesture navigation, where a swipe up returns to the home screen. Unfortunately, Waze fails to consider this, resulting in a critical flaw. While navigating, a swipe up both 1) expands route details and 2) returns to the device home screen. When returning to Waze, navigation is no longer visible, due to route details being expanded. The username selection field is also extremely buggy, nearly impossible to type in. | Freezes all the time | Too many annoying and distracting prompts.. Waze (now creepy, evil Google) also manipulates reviews. | Good info on traffic accidents and directions in unfamiliar areas. | Keeps refusing to make change to my name and username, I had to delete my account not to get possibly doxxed. | give me best way or short cut | My waze doesn't work it doesn't show where I'm going | Speed cameras alert at a distance of 500 metres, and if they were changed at a distance of 1000 metres, it would be better. All modern cameras shoot from both sides. Some of the cameras in the program are on one side and do not give notice of the presence of the camera. If it were modified to have all cameras on two sides, it would be better. | Less issues now, less problems sending eta's. I love waze. Always a little glitchy after big updates, but seems to have sorted itself out again | Stopped working at all. | I managed to log in with my google account. | 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 | Great job 🤠 | Awesome map | Excellent | new waze 2024 | I really like Waze. Or I used to. For most of the past year it just locks up all the time. A full reinstall occasionally gets it to work for a few days but then it locks up again. Waze's request for me to help them? ""Send us a screenshot"". 1. I'm driving so; no, not possible. 2. What is a screenshot of a frozen screen going to tell you? Just installed the latest update so will see how it goes but it's continued through the past year of updates so not optimistic. | Good👍 | Doesn't give the right lanes in my city (Leeds) and isn't up to date with road closures. | The concept is good, I would like to like this app. But the biggest downfall of this application is the most important thing the ability to navigate correctly! Almost every time I try this application it continues to let me down because of its inability to navigate correctly it continues to take me to the wrong address. Wish you would fix people so I'm uninstalling | Why there is no sound notification There is a camera on the highway ？ ！！！ At Ipoh highway ！！！ | Good app, seems to work ok, but I want to be audibly alerted for every single speed camera, not just 1, then it's just whether you see it on screen map... | Great app but can you do one thing? I have numerous songs uploaded to YouTube music that I can't play through the app is it keeps asking for premium which I don't want to do. If you can remove this I'll be very grateful thanks | Istanbul map is out of date. | It is working properly, but I hope the option where you can choose from 3 given routes: Express Way, Service Road, and Sky Way will come back again in the app. While using it, the only option available is the service road. These three options are helpful for Grab drivers because sometimes the passenger is the one who chooses the route we will take. | Nice | I can't even customize this app. I want to change the voice. | Awesome | Temperamental. It will show a fixed speed camera ahead, but it won't sound an alarm so if you're not looking at the map at that time you'll miss it. It constantly says pot hole ahead but won't say when there's a fix camera. It's brilliant at showing you when you're in a average distance speed area. | Great | great product just needs to update quicker | Only drawback is i like google maps user experience | No audible warning for speed cameras in NYC with the latest update!!! | good apps | Lately the driving directions are misleading in order to force the people to use the fast track or fast lanes | Amazing gps! And its free | When you need it most it brainfarts and leaves you hanging. Stay away. | Very good navigation app social focused too | Exceptional direction guide and hazard alert among the many utilities Waze provides . | Doesn't show road closures. You can, sometimes, manually indicate a road is closed if you are next to it, but otherwise you are out of luck, so the routes chosen are often useless or awful. | love the Waze | It is very easy to use. Best gps I've use so for. | Super | Great app | Great app and beautiful maps. But the core functionality to display traffic is completely broken for almost a year. The traffic lines appear and disappear as they please while you are sitting in dead stop traffic. Same happens on the Android Auto. Looks like the developers are not even aware of this bug or simply don't care. And this is on Google Pixel 7 phone with the latest Android version. | Lovely | What has happened? Suddenly Waze won't work when I'm out and about because it wants me to sign in. I try to do so and have to go through the bother of having a verification code emailed to me. I get the code, enter it, and then... It wants me to get another verification code by email. I go this then.... around and around we go! For such a long time wazer I'm feeling very unloved! | Fast and effective | Love this app | Almost perfect. Please add toll separation by countries, just like European Vignette. I want to drive to Italy, while not using Austrian toll tunnels, but use Italian Autostrada in Italy. | It the best APP | I've used a few of these apps and Waze is hands down the best, love the safety features of this app and the directions are spot on. | Hello, for about 3 weeks the voice for the camera of the speed alert has not worked, only a notice appears instead. I have been using this good app for quite a while and got so upset since the speed camera voice alerts have stopped. If this continues, I'll have to find other apps for cameras alerts. | Good application | No gps connection always show many places recently.. Not funny.. | Excellent App works great my whole family loves and uses the waze app. | Very weak QA department. Endless bugs, and when you sumbmit a bug report to Waze, the system makes you work really hard. Twice to fill almost the same form with lots of details. It takes my time, and we are not working for you. | This DID NOT show me where check points are. 😒 | Nice route Injoy | please add double tap to zoom and double tap and slide up or down to zoom in and zoom out. i will change my review if this feature added | Please bring back the animal and roadkill options! Many commuters find these useful and often have to travel in rural areas where animals like deer may jump into the roadway. | Because Google Maps crashes very frequently, I have to resort to using Waze, which has inferior voice guidance that often tells you to turn after already passing the intersection or will only tell you the name of the street you must turn on only 2 miles prior. Better than ending up in an accident because I'm getting upset over Google Maps not working and then being late to countless events as a result. I can't even copy a simple address line from Waze and have to open Google Maps for that. | Great app does what it's suppose to do | Updated review: voice commands are now working again, but I've noticed that the speed mobile camera warnings are getting later and later and sometimes aren't announced at all. This is especially true for stationary cameras. Also worth having a decent idea of where you're headed as occasionally it throws out routes or parts of routes that are less efficient or complete nonsense e.g. Exiting and immediately rejoining the same road for zero benefit. | Don't get sound on this phone. Can't figure out whether the problem is device-Samsung Galaxy 5 or the WAZ APP. | Extremely accurate | Easy to use and in my experience seems to be more accurate than Google Maps in Barbados. | Very accurate | Enjoy using app. | Información de tráfico desactualizada, rutas lentas por barrios residenciales y calles estrechas. | Good | Works !! | I've made a new account, but since when can I not add multiple stops to a planned trip???!!! Will never be using this app again. | because wrong direction im almost accident, stupid developer stupid apps","{""1"":1039453,""2"":368909,""3"":482738,""4"":1027753,""5"":5774701}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Waze","Waze","support@waze.com","http://www.waze.com","98 Yigal Alon

Actually, the user base saves lives. Thank you all who interact and use waze. We can only make it stronger (no subscription plz.) Seems like that's the direction companies are going."",""Generally, a very good app. It is definitely our preferred navigation go to through Android auto in the car (through pixel 7 in the UK). At the moment, since the most recent app update, the voice volume has gone down a bit (set to full on the phone and car), and the screen is permanently in night time dark screen (set to auto). Hopefully these will be fixed on the next update and go back to working in five star mode."",""In night-mode, the streets are now blue which is confusing because it's too similar to the color of water on the map. It makes all the roads look like canals. I'm still having trouble disabling the \""Drive Now\"" feature. Also, the \""thank you\"" notification after sending a report takes a few seconds too long to disappear - it's very distracting."",""Overall, a great app. I find it easier to use than my other navigation apps. However, keeps taking me through routes I rather avoid. Would be nice to have the ability to rate a trip or route suggestion so that the app doesn't take you through such routes you do not like. For me, I rather travel longer miles at night through the safer motorways, than through unpaved single carriage roads like the ones in the Peak district."",""This has been a great app, up until the last update. Now it no longer connects to networks (5g, with full bars showing) and constantly shows it is using offline maps. As a result it does not provide any traffic updates nor does it allow me to report ANY events along my drive. Removing and reloading the app was no help, in fact, it took about four hours to be able to log back into my account after the new download. Such a shame!""]",false,false,false,"com.waze","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en&gl=CZ"

What's the reason? Trash app | The amount trouble & anomalies I get from this app is pretty poor considering I'm basically working for them & making them money. Pretty tired of them wasting my time. | CARLOS FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS VERY UNHELPFUL AND LACKED EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. MY CONCERN AND ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED AND ADDRESSED APPROPRIATELY. THERE SEEMS TO BE A SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUE AS WELL DUE TO THE NATURE OF MY INQUIRY SO I WOULD TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS WHEN INSTALLING THIS APP. | Sold a item for £20 the buyer says it never arrived even when it did but as usual vinted always side with buyer. There no protection for sellers so now I'm £20 and a item out of pocket. Check other people reviews and social medias as your see this is a big problem with this app | Great way to sell 👍 | So easy to use | Very pleased, thanks | Great, easy to use . My only real criticism is that it can be really hard to find a category for some items (needs an 'other' code!) | Great app, sim0le to upload and list items. Seamless process buying and selling. | Now i've managed to navigate postal issues have loved using the app. Thankyou Vinted | This is good app. There are good costumers and sellers. | Great | Everything was spot on very happy thank you | Very easy to use, so far! | Buyer protection voids 48 hours after delivery is recorded and then nothing can be done to rectify an issue with the seller. Doesn't tell you anywhere that this is the case. Waste of money. | keeps deleting my stuff for no valid reason. like, come on, just let people sell stuff. Why do yall make stuff complicated with these bots.. | Decluttering.... Vinted has definitely made this easier from uploading, selling, posting and being paid. Very Smooth transactions. Thank You | Love it | Easy to use and straightforward | Banned for accidentally putting a copy of a game, tried to get account back, but vinted is run by bots. Useless!! Going back to depop! | Catching! | Awful app. Random bans. Counterfeit clothes being sold. Shambles | The app has changed so some users can only offer 20% discount versus other users can offer 40% off list price which is completely unfair. 20% makes zero sense when list price can be entirely unrealistic and item can have sat there for years! I won't buy over priced items so I simply will buy less. A really short sighted change. | Great App very easy to navigate! | Too good. Obsessed | When purchases go to plan it is perfect! It's a little tricky to navigate when something doesn't quite work as planned. | Super faina | Fast and convenient | Better than ebay | My vinted app keeps turning into French! Unable to change it back until it decides it wants to | Love the dress and very fast on sending 😍 | excellent thanks | Great app, use it all the time. Much better than some online sites and no extortionate selling fees. | Vinted need to remove inpost as an option for sending items, I've had two transactions that have messed up because of the service. I'm now fighting to get my money back for a bundle items I delivered using inpost. I'm currently dealing with extremely unhelpful automated messages and I'm gutted I've lost two fantastic pieces of clothing for nothing. Will be questioning whether I can trust this app for future. | Goede ervaringen | Everything is so straightforward and picking up from a drop off point is the way to go. | at first it was working fine then after u wanted to use the app again, the images of the products i wanted to look at werent loading at all, nothing. | easy to use and always efficent . | Great app but left the review because you need to to merge notifications and messages (as often the notification is you have a message) and use the space to just have an orders status. I.e if youve sold it it's in the queue as needing action, if it's in transit when it's been delivered etc. too easy to lose sales on messages and hiding it in your account menu is easy for older or less techy people to find. Fab app otherwise | Very easy & safe | Great site think it needs updating a bit so that the search options are better and more options on the buying and selling categories. | The algorithms that Vinted use to monitor the items uploaded are whack! You upload a tea towel which is a kitchen item and it gets deleted! The human overview is no better IMHO! A tea towel is NOT a bath towel or face towel FCOL!. Frustrating in the extreme. | Excellent | It takes a long time to sell items but it does work!! | Easy, stress free way to clear clutter and earn a bit of pocket money | Good | Amazing app, l love vinted as a buyer and seller. Easy to use. | Great app | Very good | Having a great time, didn't realise how easy it is to sell and also buy things on Vinted | Amazing App. Highly recommend. 😊 | By far the best and easiest platform to sell stuff | Vinted accused me of selling a fake item - which I didn't of course, even proved it. They didn't care, although I had an account for many years with 100% positive feedbacks. I feel sorry for everyone who is paying extra for their authentification service. They obviously don't have a clue what they are doing + support is pretty much non existent. You are way better off selling or buying stuff eg on eBay. At least they have a proper legit check service, not like the wannabe 'experts' on Vinted. | Great way to find new homes for your clothes, and make a little money as well | Love the site. | Bang on | They claim they want to help sustainability and for people to reuse items but take down listings like reusable nappies🤦🏻‍♀️ they don't personally check claims etc and many times their decision is so unfair that you are losing the item you sold and the money you received as payment. Most times you get an automated response and in general the app needs a ton of work. Dear vinted, you can allow people to sell used items and state what's their condition (as you do for clothes). | Good app but get rid of the stupid complete your look tab or at least the option to hide it! Dark mode would be nice also | Great first time order. Very fast delivery | Fantastic | Great | Quite an easy opportunity to sell your belongings on 👍 | Fantastic thanks | Everything so easy to do. Excellent. | Banned for being a business 🤣 I've had my account banned cos I sell a few single pokemon cards, they have taken this as I am a commercial seller, they're just cards I don't need 🤣 and customer service doesn't exist. I'll just make a new one and try not to make my items look so good I guess. | Item as described, postage on time. Nice clean excellent product | Vinted is OK for something but I brought some expensive things and never got them went missing | Easy to use and quickish payouts | my order is fantastic 😍 I love it | So far so good. | Very good selling and buying sight. | You can't change country. I moved actually. In the help they suggest to delete account and recreate. So now I can't reregister because my account was deleted... Bravo Vinted🤦 | Awesome | ogłoszenia zużytych rzeczy jako stan bardzo dobry, dużo osób sprzedaje śmieci. Zgłoszenie ogłoszenia nic nie daje, bo Vinted nic z tym nie robi. Słabe tłumaczenie na polski aplikacji i brak filtra kraju wysyłki. | Easy to use app they do all the hard work | Easy to use quick and efficient | Really easy to use | Super per business | Lovely. Good condition and perfect fit. | Great | Good app and works as said | Dress was in perfect condition , and packed well... from buying to collection at lockers, was straight forward, no issues | Easy to use App, and lovely community x | Everything i have purchased up to now, except for one item has been good. | Easy and convenient | easy to use | This app is good find most things I need off it 👍 | This app is amazing. Very quick and easy the shopping and you can sell your unwanted items. :) | First time I've used Vinted,, Very pleased with my order.. Great seller, great communication. Very fast delivery,, will use Vinted again,, | Very good and easy to use. | Excellent | Great opportunity to buy and sell vintage goods | Always pleasant | Customer service is really bad if you have issues The app doesn't notify you if you sell something so you end up missing out on sales | First class service | Fantastic | Very good and nice | Easy to purchase or sell items. Recommended. | Thank you | Great app for resale | All well | I really enjoy the simplicity of the Vinted app although I don't agree with the limitations on what you can sell.. Also Vinted... I know I'm not the only one, please stop changing the language to French from English, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this, it's driving me crazy keep deleting the app and having to start again. This has happened multiple times. I'm in England and I speak English. | Great app | Good quality boots. Good communication from the seller. Good delivery service. | Iam happy with what I got | So easy | Speedy comunication and delivery. | Excellent shop No problems so far | Ok | Fabulous way to upcycle clothes and other items you no longer use. Very easy to use and good support. | rly good app for buying clothes!! lots of filters to narrow down the options to what you're looking for and the payment is simple and straightforward,, also like that there's a buyer protection thing where if the product hasn't arrived in 5 days u get refunded :) found so many good finds on here | Great app, but can be very difficult to find things amongst the thousands of items. It would be useful if you could turn off results from a specific brand, e.g. turn off results from primark and new look, while keeping everything else. | Great app. Highly recommended | Great app at times but unfortunately absolutely loaded with counterfeit items and vinted do basically zero to sort it. | Great experience | Very nice bah,quality beautiful love it | Downloaded the app last week, used it once to look for some clothes and just opened it to find out I was blocked. For suspected fraud? I have no idea what could've triggered that as I did nothing but search for clothes | My experience with this app was very nice 👌 | Excellent service | Brilliant app | Been seeling bits and bobs for years,and its been great while it was being managed by lithuanians,however,its gone down massively since its been told to someone else (god knows who...). I posted a designer dress my mum got for me and i just didnt like it, had the receipt and everyting,and vinted blocked my account straight away not even asking anything,just blocked it forever?!?! What the ?!! There are MILLIONS of designer items WITHOUT any receipts,so how are they still online?disappointed | Great app | Why does it keep going into french!!! | easy to use | Sold & bought lots on Vinted, easy site to access | Fab easy to use | Easy to use and fair with no seller fees and friendly community | 👋 | good | Great | Excellent I am disabled n it has taken me almost a year to start off but oh my gosh it's so straight forward | Easy to use | Brilliant | Great app | Easy to use and the how to guides are super helpful! | Loving this app. Bought aome great clothes for next to nothing. | Very easy to sell and buy great experience | Great love the app. Easy to follow | Keeps going in French language | Everything is OK | Fab service | My account was blocked and I didn't even do anything except make an account | Excellent | Love vinted. Had some lovely things at a bargain price. 😊 | First time user...great experience! | Love this app. Easy to use. Hassle free - postage fees all sorted for you. Great | No support at all after being scammed, bye money. Never using this platform again, terrible company. | I got my order promptly. Vinted is cool | Brilliant so easy, better than Ebay 🤠👍 | Verygood | Superb | Love it! Such a great way to make a bit of pocket money from clothes and other items I no longer need. App works perfectly well and is easy to use. | Very happy | Poor UX, always crashing, no history of orders. Also, cheating seller took our money and support didn't even ban seller or provided any help, only sorry we will improve bla bla bla. Facebook market is much better. | I adore Vinted,I think is great. | Allows counterfeit goods to be sold with no real buyer protection, it's just money they're skimming off the top of each sale. Scammers delight in taking money knowing it's unlikely Vinted will decide in the buyers favour. Disgusting profiteering. Avoid | All good love this site 😍 | No problem collecting my order | I really like Vinted. There is a nice mix of used & new. There is a wide range & can be filtered to suit your needs. It is easy to use, which I like as I am not tech savvy by any means. Very good app. | As described, packaged lovely. Thank you | This app is a total fraud. They will cut money on every sell and makes people fool. If you have any problem with your transection you will never get an answer as there's no help line and an automatic msg will entertain you all the time. Really disappointed with this app and lost money. Please don't use it and tell your loved ones to stay away from vinted unless they want stress or loose money. | Great | So simple ...its my new go to | Easy to use and no fees. I have been selling things on and off for years and its nice to see a marketplace which thinks about its sellers | Very good | They always take the buyers side every time I sell something and they scam me. Ridiculous. | 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ quick delivery very satisfied thanks 🙂 | All 5 stars | Always have bargains...perfect! | Lovely sellers, can communicate to the sellers easily, reasonable price and lots to choose from. Easy to use app | Easy app to use | Good honest service | At this time good | Very smooth transaction. Item ax advertised. | Super | Brilliant love this app | Deducted 250£ and did not refund. SCAM | All worked really well! | najlepsza aplikacja do kupowania i sprzedawania wszystkiego | quick delivery and the item i ordered was in excellent condition | Absolutely gorgeous clutch bag in mint condition. Love it, thank you. | Brilliant | Very good | Suddenly permabanned for ""fraud"" when I ain't even done anything. In fact, i bought clothes the other day and was about to leave a good review. Will change my review when the moderators decide to stop punishing users for no reason on a Friday morning! | I've sold an item through Vinted which says it was delivered to the buyer on the tracking code of the transportation company. The app has a bug that say that the item was returned on March 18th while in the official website of the transportation company it says delivered on March 19th. I've contacted the support but they aren't doing anything and actually canceled the order when I gave them the tracking code... Vinted was cool but now they owe me 40€, ridiculous... | I get to rock designer outfits on budget. Thanks to vinted. | Brilliant platform | So quick and easy to sell | The app works amazingly well. A couple sellers do take a while to post items, though | Lots of people trying to scam people what is a shame. Other than that it's a great app | Good start | It's almost impossible to shop from here with all the scammers posting , everyday theres like 50 scam accounts posting specific items (which always tend to be lego,funko pops or mh dolls). finding something u like then seeing its from an acc with 0 reviews is so annoying and reporting usually does nothing. Vinted really needs to do something about this. | Tudo funciona perfeitamente, gosto de disponibilidade dos funcionários, respostas rápidas e claras☝️ | I seriously love the app. I just love the idea of second hand items sold or bough. Planet is overflowing with clothes and tons are being thrown to the landfill. I've got so many baby clothes, toys, books and so for price that doesn't ruin my finances. Now I have to get to the selling part (no experience in that part). | Happye | Good | Truffato da un acquirente, Vinted non aiuta minimamente il venditore. Pessima esperienza. | Good app, easy to use, BUT.. why the hell, as a buyer who paid for an item and then the seller not log in for a week so I cancelled the order, do I WHO PAID get the negative review?! Bit backwards tbh, it's the seller that should get the negative! | First time here. Very happy with the purchase and the whole experience. Many thanks. | Ive removed the app since it starting bombarding users with ads.","{""1"":97952,""2"":19309,""3"":27327,""4"":78642,""5"":1167474}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Vinted","Vinted","feedback@vinted.fr","http://www.vinted.com",,"https://www.vinted.fr/privacy-policy","Vinted","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Hs8pq7sF8ihEfencKzLZZh7w6A4jDF5CsALfnccHffE3P6rccKXULHXsdi6QrwuayDI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gy9k7LqOR6oV7FcqjTExGibr_A3Agr3U3TS-SBEU0UXSCUNhIQZMNHNYStB6r93tWmUT","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2AKblPA0g4YbYpEH0C_3PsXzAXpJeLDgDQ_4lKttwtCyfCJYoRiCoizMtBWiQAWklPg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zhSmO1CfnWpKzDYnns6QXZuG0w3vp-hqMsJ_Tc9xVejS2I8o48ZufkItrxWD9fKRenc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/z7Et-Sz7TgKZlBkd8-ZOWORXZRQzyypnEBoLvUYAipWvXOQie84KZSikH83l_8DcOYU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Knsqo1pAe-mgWIErNUPqvKPXheFknHtHmBYMJma-MTkYwbZWxttaNnSsFZfF6e1jDRc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qarksEqY6TFSbflDrFL86uc03iFv20ML93T3YFycpcmNOppZCTAcmtie0GrWoq_LGYU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5oLph2_l2ILQhPfVKWZ9KJTBFBAmXGvF7Jy3A4IsH9j257rpnmtmjmYdGbyLt18J8KLo""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqjQx3frm70?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gy9k7LqOR6oV7FcqjTExGibr_A3Agr3U3TS-SBEU0UXSCUNhIQZMNHNYStB6r93tWmUT",,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",true,"Apr 12, 2013",1711376082000,"24.11.3","A stitch in time saves nine.

And, I find, very friendly users and great customer support!"",""I use this app a lot, and it has been no problem with selling or buying. But the app is crashin all the time, I can't open it even if I uninstall and install it again. it's not working for a few days !

Aber die Verbindung zwischen Tchibo-Konto und Tchibo-Mobil-Konto ist zumindest hakelig. Und es ist soooo nervig, dass man sich so ziemlich jedes Mal neu anmelden muss, wenn man die App öffnet, entweder für Tchibo-Mobil oder den Shop. Und die App merkt sich auch die Zugangsdaten nicht, um sie wenigstens vorzuschlagen. Man muss sie immer umständlich suchen und händisch eingeben, oder von anderswo kopieren. Würden sie doch wenigstens ein Login-Token nutzen... | Cumbersome | It doesnt work anymore | Ürünlerin gezip sepete atmak mümkün ancak ödemeyi hep başka platformlardan yapmak zorunda kalıyorum Kredi kartı bilgilerinin girilmesi gereken tuş takımı vs görseli çıkmıyor uygulamada BKM kullanımında da seçilecek metin yerine beyaz bir boşluk oluyor sadece Sırf bu yüzden app indirimlerini kullanamıyorum | Das App ist toll aber die Verhalten zum Kunden nicht so.

I can't speak for anyone else, but my app is in a terrible state. Photos don't open right; more than halfway cut-off on the screen, EVERYTHING is freezing, closing the app is the only thing that ""resets"" things -- but that's only sometimes, and the app will up and crash on me. Galaxy S23+ user. My phone is brand new, so I don't see how it's on my end unless I was given a faulty phone. Craving old Discord. 😩 | Is anyone having an issue that when you streamming your phone screen and all your friends can see is haft of the screen? like the screen is being pull down? | It freezes every other click. Worst app | Discord never once dissapointed me I would just love to share that when discord security was upgraded it was safer, and I love how people can't send me inappropriate images anymore. | It auto updated the app! Is laggy and the UI is ugly af! Revert back the previous version! I DID NOT choose to update it! | it breaks an annoying amount and has weird flaws. Discord Nitro is absolutely stupid and not worth your money. Otherwise, it works well as a messenger app and is faster than a lot of others when it's good | Glitchy, laggy, buggy | Tech companies and introducing new UI/UX that no one asked for that makes the app objectively worse, name a better duo Whoever your UI/UX design lead is, tell him he's doing a super good job removing swipe gestures that people have used for years. It's also an extremely buggy app, and only been made worse by pushing half-baked features that no one uses. | When are yall gonna expand the group chat capacity,10 is still not enough please do expand it thank you | okay ig | The last couple updates completely broke the usability in phones. Instead of scaling down images in the channels or opening them in fullscreen as before, now there's a horizontal scroll that won't show the full picture and when you open it, instead of showing the whole image, we get a popup of the partial image that doesn't even move the image around properly. I go through tens of images a day, and now I need to do this weird scroll for every single one and can't ever see them whole. Terrible | It is a good chatting and talking app. | Click bait credit card scam. | It's kick me out | Crashes every single time I need to use it. Cannot recommend at this time | Last update made this app practically unusable.. why fix what's not broken? | It was good, I was going on my original account, which was called AcornSploinkle, and then, the next day when I log back into my account, it says I need to reset my password, even though it never done this on any of my other accounts! So I had to make a new one. Discord, please let me back into my account. I was using a different gmail, and if I could change it, I would reset my password then and there. I don't want to delete Discord, so please let me back into my account. | New updates to phone app make it frustrating to use. Every action you try to take now requires you to wait 5 to 10 seconds for the UI to catch up. Go to type a message,you have to wait to see the textbox, then the keyboard, and then for the send button to become available. Go to send a file, same delay with file browser appearing and then send button. And forget switching from messages to servers or from one channel to another or one server to another. If you can't fix it, roll it back. | Edit: The mobile app is really buggy after the big update. My DMs often crash a bit and my keyboard glitches up and I always have to restart the app to get them to work. It didn't start doing this until after the update. It still works fine, but the bugs are annoying | Not a great app for tablets, due to crashing, And screens freezing for about 2 to 3 seconds every time you use emoji's. | Good app, but been having issues lately when my headphones are plugged in and the sound continues to come out thru phone speakers. Tried with blue tooth and head phonewire just to test out what could be the problem. Uninstalled and restarted my phone seperate times, still happens. This has happened with multiple different headsets and earbuds over the years lol | I love my bf 😻 | It says to verify im human and when i click yes, it doesnt let me enter. This app is so bad... | Every time I try and log in, it says my email does not exist and it does | App used to work great about a year ago, and then they changed everything. Now, it's all complicated to navigate and continuously freezes to the point where it's not even worth trying to use. | Yet another update where the app looks shittier than the last. How do you do it? How do you make your app look worse with each new iteration? | This app has become absolutely useless to server moderators with the last UI change. Unless I'm blind, there is no option to delete messages, or ban accounts. Very helpful when you get a bot account spamming a pr0n server into every channel and you just have to let it sit there until you can get to a PC. | I can't login with my correct password whats the problem???? | Login Nahin ho raha hai ID kitne time try Kiya forgot kya password Sab Kuchh Kiya Koi Mera login OTP are verification ka bhi option A raha hai OTP Dal raha hun OTP work Nahin ho Raha 😡😡 | Addicted to it. Don't download if you want to focus of study or work. | none of the animated profiles or bios actually animate for me anymore so it feels like I'm not getting my full moneys worth with nitro most of the time | App is progressively getting worse. Less and less intuitive, slow responding and overwhelmingly poor performing. | Very laggy and clunky UI, can't hear custom uploaded soundboard effects (default are fine) and if someone has their camera on during a VC it freezes randomly on my side often. But app is functional i guess | File limit, for nitro only, seriously? Can't even send 1 single picture, especially not videos. Useless | It thinks I'm a bot and can't message anyone | It's not good don't download it!! | Updates suck | 1 star till bad mic quality is fixed for samsung users. My mic works fine in every app and phonecall but specifically discord is muffled beyond all means.... Considering its kinda the whole point of discord it would be nice to have that fixed....But I know it wont be because I am finding threads 2 years old complaining... Desktop and apple work properly but andoid users suffer in literal silence.... I swear if their reply bot says to reset wifi again. Its not the wifi. Its your broken app. | Cool | It's so hard to log in after you've logged out once and im sure my password is 100% right but still it says invalid and then when I do forgot password and they send otp it NEVER WORKS it's always invalid. | Ok | It doesn't let my email work so I can't get in | love it! best app to text friends and it's so safe! | I have to write another bad review these updates are getting out off hand its not even optional anymore everything is getting worst each update. Discord was so much better a few years ago it feels like a rip off version of discord now if someone makes an app similar to Discord you guys are gonna lose your community. Edit why don't yall got 4k quality on gifs and and videos i can count the pixels discord is so trash sometimes with millions of people buying subscriptions yall should put it into dc | It works on my old damaged phone. And does it work at all on my new phone. Make it make sense to make your app work consistently It shouldn't function less on a new phone. | I can't join server that i am banned from plz help | Good app | The search function is much more difficult and limited compared to before. Edit: switching to 1 star because of different annoying experiences. One of which is the conversation summaries. There's no option to turn it off and the notifications are annoying. The summary by the AI is wrong too sometimes. | Ever since they changed the UI, i've had nothing but problems. I video call a lot on mobile, and its a huge problem when I constantly am experiencing screen freezing, the sound lags, and I have to tap the screen multiple times if I want to even bring up the buttons or make the preview of who I am talking to larger. Discord please get this fixed, it is a huge problem! | Hey discord team, I was wondering if you could fix the bugs on Discord also have a question of yall because when I put my connections app to my profile it shows an error I don't know if it's the mobile data or WI-FI it was perfectly fine when I put it but it keep showing me an error that hasn't connect to it so maybe you could be that the problem of it cause I was having issues into my profile with connection apps. Just letting yall know that it was an issue okay keep hard work Discord team's | I cant open favorite gifs but other than that I actually am starting to like the UI update | ကုတ်မကြလိူ့ကူညီပါဦး | Unfortunately the app is just broken for mobile, the video is always upside down!! | The last updates broke the app. My video on mobile is constantly flipped upside down, and gets delayed. Everyone I know is facing this issue on mobile | The new update made discord so damn laggy cant call or text anyone anymore without crashinf | enshitification is a curse that comes for us all | The app is great, I had this app since 2021 and I really didn't have that many problems, but this recent update has messed my stuff up. My mic isn't working, and I can't hear my friends. I asked them and they said it's just ME. I tried everything and it still doesn't work. | This app is useless I can't get back in it | It's a great app but it gave me a warning for ""child safety"" but they never showed me how i broke that guideline? | Great | New UI is terrible, it is very clear to everyone that you are forcing it in order to make navigation take more steps so that you have more opportunities to show Nitro advertisements. I've been a long time Nitro subscriber. I'm unsubbing from Nitro due to having the old UI revoked, and due to new aggressive marketing approaches. If you are seeking infinite growth then you'd better start selling, because your IPO isn't going to be successful with messes like this. EDIT: accuracy & another typo fix | Can't seem to login due to ""login or password being incorrect"" despite the fact that I've gotten everything correct AND I've changed my password multiple times. | I accidentally unistalled the app and for the life of me I cannot get it to redownload. Edit: That article didn't help at all... | I need to verify my number but I don't have one! I'm only ten pls remove it | Fantastic | Hello, Discord. Can you help me retrieve my account? I can't use it because my account needs to have an email to work, but I made my account with my number.

But Discord ruined Discord Mobile. | new UI SUCKS maybe ask the comunity first?(last review 3+star review=1year) like 2 people likr it BUT PLEASE ADD A BUTTON TO CHANGE IT BACK... what??? YOU ALSO MADE THE SEARCH FEATURE USELESS????? MIGHT ASWELL REMOVE IT THEN it does nothing.

When I open picture only blank screen opens up. I don't know what's problem with pictures only suddenly... It was working fine years ago. | DISCORD I LOGGED OUT AND I FORGOT MY PASSWORD AND ITS SAYING SOMETHING WENT WRONG THIS HAS HAPPENED 16 TIME AND I HAD TO MAKE DIFFERENT ACCOUNT PLEASE STOP THIS. | suara patah patah kdng hilang, apalah | Give us back the old ui | Very good | tolol banget anjay gw chat pacar gw ga di bales² ampe skrg, tlg perbaikannya min spy pacar saya chat sy lgi | If using phone number verification it doesn't work so it's useless app | Discord is a good app but sucks at the same time. I did some research about my problem and realized I am not the only one suffering to this kind of bug. It says my password is incorrect but it is really correct. I asked someone who experienced this and they said nothing happens and they all end up creating a new account or deleting the app. I asked for assistance in discord support but they keep suggesting things that doesn't work. I hope you can fix this kind of bug in ""verification required"" | Nice app, recommend for everyone | I can't press the message section because of this new layout update. | Good 😊 | The most recent update on this app has made it very unstable and glitchy while using the app. Please review and update | I hate it I tried to log in but still showing email Change it won't even gonna let me in just still showing it for a month and never ganna talk about my friends for just being show-oof email | amazing 😍 | When I put my old account and log in, it would let me | New layout sucks. I just now got the new update and i have no idea what im doing and i HATE layout changes in apps. I might actually quit and uninstall discord because of this unless we get the previous layout back. Discord thinks theyre ""fixing"" and ""improving"" the app but theyre ruining it. Discord has become so money hungry and sucky and this is my final straw. Go back to the previous layout or i and many other people ive talked to about this will instantly uninstall, mark my words. | I have been using Discord since 2020, primarily on PC and there I have no real complaints. My issue is that the mobile app is REALLY slow and requires and requires a powerful phone to use comfortably. | When I want to watch a video in discord from another my screen will freeze | Niceeeeeeeeeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍 | One of tbe worst app ever . U cant navigate hrough app . | This is not working app no click on button 😤💩💩👎 | It is a good app but why not allow 10 years old people? | I have come from moon valley website but this app have too much issue during run. | Keyboard does not work. | The only issue is that whenever someone sent me an invitation to a server, it keeps saying Invalid invite | Can you please fix the bug of the camera being upside down when you turn your phone horizontal. This is a problem for all of my friends who have also downloaded the latest update. | Its beautiful how this app is becoming worst update after update. One word for describe it: garbage. pc and phone. Discord team dont want to hear anything about it. They know what's need to be done but they are doing nothing. Give one star is a gift lol To discord employee: STOP RESPONDING TO MY REVIEW. STOP SAYING THAT I NEED TO BE UP TO DATE, IT IS OTHERWISE THE APP CANT START! FIX IT! | Awesome, Also it's not letting me log back in into my account | It used to be good, but now it's going down the hill and has a whole lotta bugs. Sometimes i can't open any discussion or chat, need to reopen discord, last week i wanted to call my friend, but i couldn't because it said we weren't friends, i tried adding him and it said we are already friends, and reopening it didn't help. Also sometimes nothing at all works, I can't even press any buttons, and very often pictures and videos don't load. Don't let the app get in public before it's ready please. | Amazing! This has so many settings to make it however ur comfortable with | This app is getting more disappointing the more they update it. I wish we can switch back to the old UI whenever I video call my wife, or friends their camera always freezes it never did this till the new update happened. I have to exit out of full screen to mini screen to make it unfreeze but it's not 100% guaranteed to work. Let us revert back. | This is op because iplay the games with my friends by the help of this app | Saishree | Clearly everyday it's getting worse even tho the app is up to date. The GIF/emote menu half of the time just covers half of the screen when I'm trying to type something,when I tryna watch a video the sound doesn't work when it's on fullscreen, texts are buggy and are not showing up correctly, basically I restart Discord almost every 30 minutes because it became so buggy and clearly it's pissing me off. Should've stayed to the old design, at least it was functional. | Keep making the app worse! Please!!! I just love it when you guys make the app worse and worse with each update!! My video is always upside down in horizontal mode! Call videos keep freezing and I have to restart the app every time! Man I love the broken image/video sending menu so much! | The new layout is trash just remove it and go back to the old one honestly now I think WhatsApp is better. Thanks for ruining Discord Mobile🥀 | It is good for all things that people would like, but it kicked me out of my account, and now, after I put my information in it and it gives me the code it says code invalid and when I create a new account it says to verify my password and number just to add friends from my contacts then after I do that it asks me if I'm a robot then when I finally finish it's test it gives me another code and when I put it in it says code invalid or verify number. | I can't ever create account | Nice bro I like it ☺️ | Why is the app zoomed in? Like I can't see the people in the server on the right like desktop. This app was better before. | This is the app where I met some precious peoples in my life | I can't create an account plsss fix it | Awesome | out of all the apps, this one has the biggest piece of dogshit security. | Not working this app. | Bro it's said they can make an acc for me this app deserve 1 star if you guys fixed it it's good | Very Bad | I like this app | Man discord pls fix this issue I am trying dm anyone it's but it's showing we have to verify that your human, I am human and speak in dm with everyone how can i be a bot I have waiting for 2 days and open after 2 days still the same issue | New mobile UI is absolutely horrid and unreliable. Notifications don't send me to where I want to go, images always load zoomed in and in landscape upon first loading the app and I either have to rotate my screen twice to fix it or reload the app completely. Same goes for uploading images. You guys made the mobile app worse in every way possible, hands down, can't think of anything good that came from this change. Would it hurt that much to even give us the option to change back to the old UI? | The app completely breaks when the shape of the acreen changes. It becomes impossible to open new screens in some cases. Sometimes part of the user interface is cropped with no way to fix it. | Please for the love of name, change the format back. This new update is horrendous. | I delete this app for a while cuzz of my storage space,and I wanted to reinstall and log in but it says invalid email and password even tho there are from my account | Why discord log in with QR code doesn't login when trying to scan with mobile | I love it | I can't even verify even if I keep pressing verify I can't log on can create an account and ton more man it just suck | I can't even dm someone I haven't talked to before even if we have servers in common | I hate the new layout on calls. Like it's Knott's user-friendly. Can you moved everything around. It's way more annoying in evey way now | The updates are absolute garbage, it makes my Discord slower and won't even load videos that people send. It even takes forever to pull up my keyboard just to type a message. | Awesome app. | I am staying away from this app for a long time Don't use this app it's not safe for kids | I honestly don't understand how the app requires you to restart it for it to be functional. I literally cannot join any voice chats when I was previously in it seconds prior on desktop. Seriously this app is completely terrible and awful to use on the phone. Why has this experience been changed from it's core identity? To tailor to the masses for a *user friendly* UI to streamline messaging? | Amn app | Every update this keeps getting worse and worse | Minecraft | Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh | VERY BAD when I tried to register my account I firstly tried from the phone number one so than I putted my account number it said that an sms was send to my number I like waited for like a half and a hour code was not sended then I tried from the email one I put email my display name password did 'are you a human' thing and then it said that my email was already registered it was the first time I was using it so please fix this🙃🙃 | Noce | Now is trash | I can't upload image and video!!! | It won't accept my email anymore it logged me out completely | Nice | 🤮 | Op app and I talk super I give 5 stras | terrible, can't even delete all dm message at once | Bro is so laggy, calls barely work, messages and groups are now at different tabs, you can't just swipe to the side to get rid of the message tab, it breaks to easily, it takes forever to send things | Good and great, but if I'm new, why can't i just join a sever | recent updates make this app complete garbage. you can't always load an image. they moved everything around making menus and things harder to access. to look at members of a channel you need to click instead of swipe making it impossible if you have a bigger screen. this app is trash. I hope they revert it back | Sense the new update my mic can't be picked up and I can't hear my friends either dispite multiple attempts to fix it but I can hear myself on voice notes fix your app discord | Nice PJ | I love | Got used to the new layout, so it's fiiiine. But sometimes, the categories of servers are open and when I close them and reopen Discord another time, it's open again. I have them closed for a reason, so there isn't a large amount of channels on my screen, but it's really annoying when Discord keeps reopening them when I get back on. Can there be a fix to this, please? Then maybe it'll be a 5-Star Edit: They fixed it, 5-Star deserved | Latifat | The very second I uninstalled this app, I lost 300 pounds, made many new friends, improved my relationship with my parents, got a job, and got a girlfriend. | It was working fine before but since the upgrade, it's extremely slow to switch between channels, server's and even direct messages. It's a bug please fix this ASAPP cus it's really frustrating 😪 | When i rotate my phone horizontal mode my camera is upside down, so annoying. | Really cool app, let's me talk with friends and other gamers like myself which I love about Discord. | Bad app 👎 | It is good to text and all but I forgot my passwords and all of the passwords I want are already used and I can't think anymore and I couldn't think anything this app isn't great wouldn't recommend. | Waste app | The app keeps closing I'm sick of it | Trash ui in new update | It burns when I pee | I keep getting scammed when I try and buy nitro | It's a great app for even phoning ma mate top teir | Very good | Ridiculous app, they asked for too much information to verify your account, Google forms and stuff | I can't video chat without the other person's camera freezing. Have no clue why. | Buggy at times. I think it's having trouble with my phone screen size | The new ui is awful | It not as good as it when COVID was around | I like it | nice | EDIT: The app is getting...WORSE. Discord devs. I understand your job isnt easy. GIFs don't load, video calls are off screen, it takes WAY too long to switch channels, servers, etc. AWFUL The new mobile app is atrocious.The servers I frequent have options to follow certain channels and my choices don't stick. Hell, the channels I mute don't stay muted either, so my phone is constantly buzzing with new posts. It's irritating. Especially since discord is where I socialize throughout my whole day. | i use it almost everyday and i have no problems | Sorry to say but I think Discord need a few updates. Honest saying, this app is kinda mess. Sorry. And the verification code send is... I don't know! Kinda drag for me. The time required always end faster. Then, it caused me to verify the code many times. ..... Fine, I slowly getting used with this app and I say good job team! But, my code problem... I don't know about the latest one, how it going. | First of all, the app feels terrifyingly heavy. It's laggy, it's bad. It's not a great experience for a texting app. And sending voice messages is also laggy. It's useless if its basic functionalities are obsolete. Second of all, it's a buggy mess. Every time I open the app, it shows my status as Online even though I always have it set to Invisible. Third of all, I have not much else to say. I just wanted to make it three. Uninstalling. Not worth the annoyance it gives me. | It's nice. Though, my nitro subscription ran out. So, my friend tried to gift me nitro again, but it goes to credit, even though I don't have nitro. Even when I cancel the subscription, it still says I have nitro. Yet, I don't have it. | Since 2019 I've been using discord and it was never this back until now. The constant delays when I try to press something. I have to constantly tap things for them to start working even if I close the app and restart it, phone calls are fully trashed. I've never lagged before with the old version of discord but now it's a constant lag, it takes me forever to look in a server or to join a call on mobile, just use pc. They 'fixed' mobile though there was nothing to fix bring back the old version. | On my discord the updated on 5th March But on play store updated 18 march. why? | discord ruins you | At any single click this app will first verify if I'm human and that is so frustrating and annoying, like I can't even navigate through the app for five minutes without verifying if I'm human for more than ten times. | جميل | Nice | Trash UI/UX, limited information and removed features. I will not raise this rating until old UI/features returns | As useful as this app has been in the past few years, it seems that every update that involves the ui only works to harm the experience. Things have only gotten more complicated and more inaccessible with each update. | I HATE THIS UPDATE!!!! PLEASE SWITCH IT BACK I BEG OF YOU PLEASE DON'T DO WHAT INSTAGRAM DO AND IGNORE PEOPLE AND THINK THE UPDATE IS BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT'S NOT | pretty good, not mind blowing amazing, but it's better than others I've seen. I don't like the nitro thing, thats really annoying at some points, but it's decently easy to get around sometimes | This app destroys mentalitys and it's making kids too weak for the real world or just making them kill themselves discord is something I wouldn't recommend it to someone under 15 | STOP BREAKING TUPPERBOX | Updated review: See review history for my previous reviews. Not only is it taking far longer to fix the UI (i know people who have the old UI again), but there are bugs appearing out of literally nowhere. No updates, yet new bugs are just randomly appearing. Foolish to think Discord even gave a speck of a care for their app. | It sucks | Super swag | It's a good app | Gifs section is laggy on my OnePlus Nord.

It is late and 2. It isn't really helpful."",""Great app! Can we start putting accessibility options in all the apps! If I could make the fonts 1.5 bigger inside every app, it would be great. Coz the phone is not gonna have the suitable size as required inside the app. It's mostly gonna be ridiculously too big or something like that. Kind of like a tweek for lower vision people. And maybe have the couloir of the dates not white on white with a light black outline... that is super crazy... then on top of that, it's small too! Honestly honest!"",""Your app is a very nice app. Easy to navigate and good UI. But I think your app isn't a live football app because tell me why during the match, a formation change will be made by a team and it will be updated in other football match apps but your will not be updated to the recent forma tion change that has been changed. Work on it please, that's why it's called a live football match app to get information on what's happening in the match at that moment. Thank you"",""One of the best football app, but recently there is an issue that the app doesn't show odds in the list of games even when in settings it's put as to be showing... sometimes it suddenly start showing and later it's gone again,very irritating sometimes, could be the reason for that a location if i travel to different countries? I will change it to 5 stars"",""Been using it for at least 8-10 years. For me it's like the Facebook of football apps. I would like you to add more info to the head to head section. Other simmilar apps have this, like team streaks on different stats like corners, cards, over & under, etc. I keep those apps just for that.

I can't see the promotion and sales any more. On the official site of Lidl Hellas, gives me some other application which is not available for my country !? 🤔 | The app stopped working and it not able to show anything i try to open | Information is great , good bargains | Képtelenség megnézni az aktuális akciós újságokat, nagyon lassan vagy egyáltalán nem tölti be. Az újság alatti terméklista sem használható könnyen, random módon ugrál görgetés helyett | Antes mostrava a lista de produtos. Era a razão pela qual tinha a app e aquilo que faltava na app nova.

I've unistalled and downloaded again neither this or the plus are working with same stating issue! My Samsinf works very fine... Please do something! Thanks 🙏 | Useless app. No stock tracking, no loyalty program, no onsite shopping assistance. | This app is only for native speakers.....if you don't know the language of specific country....just forget to use the app..... developer must look on this issue. | App won't update continuously saying problems. | It easy when u hav been shown it x | Usava a APP com regularidade para procurar certos produtos, o que fazia em poucos toques no ecrã agora sou obrigado a fazer o triplo de toques no ecrã. Honestamente, a vontade de pesquisar os produtos na APP diminui imenso e consequentemente as minhas visitas à loja. | It is a fraud. Since I have downloaded there is a bug popping up | Region restrictions makes it impossible to me, living in Spain, to install this app. | Uma pena estarem abandonar a forma de ver produtos antiga e a passearem para catálogo como na app nova. Muito menos prática. | Cannot change the lang | Satisfaction 100% | So this app is to be discontinued? The Lidl Plus is extremely unfriendly, when it comes to checking out the current offers, so please do not discontinue! | They're going to remove this app which has a better wishlist than the plus app, that doesn't show any pictures preview on its wishlist | Excellent | Great 👍🏻 👌 l love the deals on the staff | Work very well.

Please adjust your drop down menu. Its insulting to have this place called a country and its very insulting to have a Loyalist flag emblem representing the majority of people here in the North of Ireland which has now a Nationalist majority. | Great. | Beware it's a massive battery drainer.

En concreto la función de búsqueda (la más útil a mi parecer) no carga y vuelve a la página anterio. | The app has been very slow lately. The product images are not loading at all. | Unfortunately keeps crashing | I temporarily residing in hungary now and don't know hungarian language. This app doesn't have english. If i change country as english speaking country, it will show products which are for that country. So i cannot give good review for this app. And also the people who are working in lidl shops are also do not speak english. | Good service | Gresy | Ovo je sramota od kompanije! Da ima 0 dao bi nulu!

Really?? | I could not find the location for lidl nearest to my from where i am purchasing everytime | Nice | Very slow loading after last update. | No se pueden comprar articulos de alimentación | Great! | A shop that has every thing that I want and more | all good | No pictures, just empty boxes and no visual imigary of the brochure | App not loading images at all | Guys, tell your developers that they f..ed up the app loading. Not possible to take minutes and minutes to load a few thumbnails. This was loading instantly before some updates. | It takes 2 hours to install it!? | The superior Lidl app, lacks nothing in my opinion other than the Lidl Plus discount. | Could be designed to have a better ui and make for ordinary people to use | Pretty useless app. Rarely have offers on the advertised day. Most disappointed considering it is supposed to be a European Supermarket! | Barely usable after the last update,very dissapointed. | Letztes Update hat Virus Überraschung. Was soll das? App hat ständiges Problem fließend zu laufen, überlanden mit Graphik Unsinn und jetzt Virus. | Horrible after the latest updates, barely usable. Not loading and jus outright freezing. Avoid | Have sent.email but no luck .asking.why I can't get carbenara sorce anymore from garston shop it's mean months now. | not for me sorry | Didn't know how to use it | You tell us to register on your app, and I can't find anywhere to register??? | Aktuálne je extrémne skomplikovaná možnosť pridať letakové produkty do nákupného zoznamu. Vyhľadávanie nefunguje... Prečo nie je všetka funkcionalita v jednej aplikácii Lidl, ale máte dve aplikácie, kupóny v jednej nákupný zoznam v druhej (letáky sú v oboch). Nákupný zoznam aj po prihlásení na viacerých zariadeniach nie je synchronizovaný, inšpirujte sa sesterským Kauflandom kde je zoznam aj karta s kupónmi v jednej aplikácii a po prihlásení jedným účtom sa synchronizuje medzi zariadeniami. | The last couple of updates has made the app very slow to open pages | Broken | Love this shop. Great stuff and staff are good | would love to to be able to access food | Quick way to check what is awailable. | Very nice | CANT LOAD LIDL PLUS! | It is really bad after last update | No english support, no groceries list. | Good product good price | What happened to lidl plus | lidl on a parr with Aldi | No Thanks | Fab service and great prices | My phone is incompatible with this app.😢😢 | Convenient | Prices don't have decimal point and display is used poorly, icons too big | Can't select my nearest store! | Its nice be good thank for the love | 3/5 Overall useful app. But using some cheap ways of generating traffic to the physical stores. Too often items on promo are missing in the store. The shelf is empty. Also in BG version of the app you name an offer section for fruits&vegetables ex: ""...starting 09.10"" usually monday. You open the section and half of the items discount starts later that week. If you name it that way, you should place all the items from that day, the rest is just cheating, sorry. | Good | Very good for shopping | I like the store I always shop at Lidl they have good quality veggies so meat and everything it's fresh. Keep us happy with your quality. Good luck | Absolutely rubbish | Good but could be better | 👍 good | Always cheaper on lots of food .alcohol etc | Ich habe ab dem 08.08.2023 den Kauf von Kleidung für das Kind angeordnet und diese über mein Bankkonto bezahlt. Ich habe die Kleidung, für die ich bezahlt habe, erst an diesem Tag erhalten und möchte Sie darüber informieren Eine Verzögerung von sieben Tagen wird sich auf meine zukünftigen Einkäufe und mein Vertrauen in Ihr Unternehmen auswirken, da sich die Lieferung nach vollständiger Zahlung des erforderlichen Betrags verzögert. | Gut | Ne radi opcija za odabir podrazumeva ne prodavnice | No Lidl plus available | Good app | Rubbish. | Zaw. S jo z. D.. Zn😅🐱🐱. Zx😄❤️🤣😐❤️😄😜🐃😚😚😥😂 | The best shopping stores 🤩👍 | Unfortunately the app will not let me select a store | Used to work better before the last update, if you choose another country, it's now only in local language can't see how to change to English language. | It's not to choose the language option | Don't want | Excellent quality 👌 👏 👍 | Fantastic and no plastic card | If you are in Greece you can see offers only in greek language which is stupid since there are many tourists that doesn't understand greek. It would be nice to have option for english language. | Good Service | Pointless | You cant even search a product(they have it in stock) in this app, so funny.... | Will not show on my device | Not good enough | Home page suddenly stopped working today. | Lidl need a geography lesson. UK seems to basically be England, Scotland and Wales. Maybe Lidl has insight to the future and there's going to be a united Ireland.....why they've no NORTHERN IRELAND on any of their apps ... | Very hard to get it to do what you want. | No one find some of the things on the shelves that they are on leaflets. Some of the things do not have the price or the wrong price. | Great app | Very good | How can i translate to english in apps, i cant understand czech languange? Im search for the automatic translate in apps the only choice is change country not the words, thank you | Since the last update, you can't see anymore the date the products enter the offer. I can add product for my shopping list only to discover in the store that the product only appears a couple of days later | Ultimamente,ad ogni aggiornamento TOGLIETE qualcosa.2 o 3 aggiornamenti fa avete tolto la sezione pollice verde che era IMPORTANTISSIMA per me. Dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento,non si vedono più i prodotti non food della settimana prossima. nonVedo soltanto dei prodotti delle altre settimane, anzi NON li vedo. Dite alla bidella che faccia una nuova applicazione perché questa FA SCHIFO egregiamente. | Good 4 shopping | Brilliant well described items.just wish you could click and collect or courier order on large items | Great | I live in Lithuania but I'm a foreigner. The app here has no English language as an option, only Lithuanian. | Their offers for spending over certain amounts are ok when they work but very frustrating when you can't activate. 'Incomplete with nuts' I've not added nuts! Yes I'm connected to the internet and yes I'm fully registered as I've used it for months but it keeps failing now and I'm not sure it's worth the hassle any more. | Абсолютно малоумно приложение | Perfectly explained 😄 so easy to use. | Used to work better but now I can no longer see all the categories of products that are arriving in the coming days. For example, I buy a lot of plants for my garden from Lidl, but there isn't a link from the home page to see the selection of plants any more. They do eventually appear if you scroll down through all the products, but why would they have taken away the useful direct link? | No update information from the developer, sounds sinister to me??? | The app on my phone does not always work in store. A card would be much better, to get the savings and coupons. | Rubbish site can't log into it | Great | Where has the barcode gone? | Good | Continually asks for an update even after update is I stalled | Lies, lies, and more lies Any products advertised on here may or may not appear in the store you select. And the prices shown may or may not be what is charged in store. Today, I went to buy some plants advertised on the app at 1.69€ each, but the price in store was 9.99€. Clearly, they are just placing the products on the app to entice you into the stores. | When I try to install Lidl Plus,it says,""This item is not available in your country,"" meaning in Switzerland! Is Lidl Plus unavailable for people in Switzerland? | Disappointed from last update. You can't see all offers anymore by just scrolling. You have to click every category ... Scroll.... Go back.. select another category.. scroll again, go back... Why would you make something like this? | Worse and worse after each update. The layout now is not nice at all. I remember a time when by just scrolling down the list of products I knew exactly if a price was per kilo or per package nd also the packages weight/unit, there was no need to click on a product just to know this elementary and necessary information. I dont understand why you need to completely ruin the app | More difficult to update than other apps | Good for offers usually find in store only get 6 days to use the offers | The app have many bugs and doesn't work and freeze multiple times. It's doesn't uploaded the pages | I type food in the search bar and ot showse tools! I type honey and It shows me ketchup! | That the app needs access to your location and no means to do it manually, made me uninstall instantly | I xan not update!!!! | Sadly the app is quite useless. I expected to see all the (food) products that Lidl sells but there isn't even a dedicated food section in the app. All the food items should be photographed (including the back side with the food values like calories & proteins, which isnt the case now). Take a look at Mercadona's app, you should copy it!!! | Can't add the weekly offers to my shopping list!! - even though it should be straight forward! - open the weekly offers and tap on the ones that you want on your shopping list. Can't get an answer in the help section either - I'm uninstalling the app. Perhaps they should take a look at the awesome Rewe app | My app has problem, I open it but suddenly it is closed, I Uninstall y reinstall but still it has the same problem | bruikbaar en nuttig | Not informative enough. | Useful app, up to a point. Dates of fresh offers are a let down as they are not in date order, mixed in with earlier ones. Very messy | Sometimes it's dose not work.. | I find your lid I plus offers complicated and not even having on my phone buy 3 cakes and get your 4th one free you are giving nothing away so I would give 0 out of 10 | My experience with lidi is very good but sometimes when I go for something it isn't there that's the only thing wrong and the service is very good | Fabulous! Can Save Your Shopping 🛒 List Yay! 🤸🏼‍♂️ | Too comkplicated | Good | Good | The app has a problem that I've been seeing for at least a year. I've saved certain products in my account, and when I log in through a computer, I can't find them. It's like going into two different profiles, but I'm not. I also noticed that the prices of the products are different from those in the application, and directly on the site through a computer. I'm sorry, but it's not right to offer the same product at a different price, at the same time. But the products are of high quality mostly. | This place is good for all your food shopping and is very good on price as well so go and try it | App was not working | Great | Σταματήστε να κάνετε τόσο συχνά update έλεος κάθε 3 μέρες ένα update για να δω προσφορές","{""1"":135587,""2"":20975,""3"":34591,""4"":52107,""5"":203171}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Lidl","7666509303365930182","app-support@lidl.com","https://www.info.lidl/","Lidl Digital Trading GmbH & Co.

Ale to jsem právě dělal. Tak že super smyčka, ze které není cesty ven. Jedna velká katastrofa a amatérismus.

I just pulled it out of the box. Total rubbish. Why is it your concern what I do with MY phone? I'd have an easier time actually rooting the phone and hiding the root from this stupid app. EDIT: Please, stop bullshitting. PSD2 does NOT mandate consumer device scanning in any way. SCA requires MFA without providing too many implementation details. CSC talks only about secure transmission. Your colleagues on the customer line told me to unroot my phone... | Only usable if you're paying on other device cuz when I try to pay on same device this fing app will open it self fully and the app I'm paying in will ""close"" so even after 6th attempt to approve payment I still have to approve again and again and nothing happens and the fix is so easy just make it approvable thru notification only and make simple pop-up biometric window no need for fully opening the app why | Neustále cpe aktualizaci, přitom aktualizace neproběhne bez jasného označení důvodu.

Since reporting the issue to the helpdesk (more than 1 week ago), no-one has proactivly gotten in touch with me to let me know what is wrong. I would also expect that helpdesk colleagues can find the entry in helpdesk system so I would not need to explain what is wrong every time I call to find out what is the state of the issue. Edit: I haven't received any incident NR | Unfortunately, the ""upgrade to smart key+"" fails on Android 14 with all-saying ""something went wrong"" message. | An app from a thoroughly corrupt bank. Avoid this bank. | Nesnáším tuhletu aplikaci! Nemůžu se dostat ke svým penězům, k identitě občana, k ničemu! Nedá se to vzájemně napárovat s tou ""Smart"" appkou | Po aktualizaci na android 14 nefunkční | Dobrý den, proč má ta aplikace 110 MB kdyz je to jen ověřovací klíč? Celá hlavní appka KB má 147 MB, jejich klíč 51 MB. Celá appka Hello ma 32MB a mBank 116 MB. | Po kliknutí na notifikaci při nové platbě trvá dlouho než se otevře, pak už pracuje ok. Ale možná to je jen mým starým telefonem... | Remember,this app is also used by seniors who do not fol|ow your developers way of thinking. | Otřesná aplikace jejíž smysl mi zcela uniká... Zakázali mi online bankovnictví vnutili mi Smart banking aplikaci... To teď už taky nestačí, nově je třeba další aplikace nyní Smart key... Nevím proč by měly dvě aplikace být bezpečnější než jedna... ČSOB bankovnictví je všechno jen ne Smart, v UniCredit jde všechno, i posílání plateb v jedné aplikaci, účet u ČSOB jsem si nechával jen kvůli stavebku a nejspíš bych byl poté líný si ho zrušit,ale když nemůžu normálně posílat platby,tak je mi k ničemu | Bohužel, stále není možné potvrzovat platby na stejném telefonu, ze kterého platím. Po posledním updateu je to ještě horší, než to bylo... | strasny, hrozny, priserny, vlezly | Vynucená instalace aplikace, která technicky není potřeba. Namísto využívání existujících ověřených a otevřených řešení. Navíc není implementované přihlášení ani jako proper 2FA. Do správy identity se lze dostat i bez původního silného hesla. | Dnes další výpadek smart klíče. Navíc nedávno byla celodenní plánovaná odstávka bankovnictví! Rozhodně nedoporučuji! Nechápu, proč musí mít tato stupidní banka separátní aplikace na bankovnictví a na potvrzování. Kvůli zbytečné složitosti a nespolehlivosti aplikací jsem přešel k jiné bance, kde jsem naprosto spokojen. | Fajn apka | Impossible to approve payments, switching between other app and Smart Klic cancels the payment verification. Basically I need 2 phones now to create and approve payments in 2023. Android 10, no workarounds found. As a client since 2007 I am very unhappy with this. | The prompt to verify a payment is always in Czech, so we are asked to verify something we don't understand. Big violation of security principles. (P.S. I work in cybersecurity, at Fortinet). | Po potvrzení platby přijde druhá žádost o potvrzení jako notifikace. Nepochopitelné. | Good | Does not work on rooted phones, using the excuse of ""regulations"". However, applications of other Czech banks work perfectly on rooted phones. | Nepochopil jsem, proč musím mít další aplikaci sloužící jen pro ověřování mých akcí jako je přihlášení do internetového bankovnictví či potvrzení odchozí platby, atd 🤦‍♂️. Ostatní banky, jmenovitě Air bank či Fio, mají vše zabudované v jedné aplikaci mobilního bankovnictví a je to tedy značně pohodlnější. Také nechápu proč Smart Key sbírá data o mých nainstalovaných aplikaci 🧐 s cílem mne ochránit, když tuto funkci již zastává nativní funkce Play Protect od Googlu 🤨. | Nastavit outage na celý den a nevypnout nutnost ověření, nebo to neprepnout na SMS, to je vážně super. | not easy to use | Not working for the activation keys , keep popping out Errors | Vše funguje skvěle, žádné problémy jsem nikdy nezaznamenal. | Nesmyslná aplikace, která pouze zabírá prostor a prostředky! Ale ČSOB ji vyžaduje pro kšefty s osobními údaji. | Šílenost. Proč další aplikace? Takhle to už nikdo neřeší, končím s ČSOB, když není schopná udělat normální internetové bankovnictví do mobilu. Nedoporučuji a varuji před tímto nebezpečným sledovacím softwarem. | Works (so far). Utterly lacking in security, even though you are forced to use it. You can choose to login with biometrics, which is laughably easy to misuse by a malicious party gaining possession of your phone, or a five(!) digit PIN. Five digits exactly, mind you, you can't even pick something longer and thus at least marginally more secure. The idea that all someone needs to steal my money is either a finger, or a simple five digit code is frankly terrifying. | Terrible product, really! Go back to Brussels! Hlavatý , | I will never use this app, please implement it into mobile banking in some nice way (e.g as AB has it), untill then I will pay with cards from other banks. Too low rating for banking app. Edit: should I consider CSOB Smart to be security risk just because it offers aroud 20 features which I do not want? (and does not contain one which I need) | Tak tahle aplikace je vážně největší zbytečnost pod sluncem. Proč to sakra nemáte v hlavní aplikace, ale musíte mit 2 aplikace? Totální komplikující nesmysl. Zlatá Moneta. k odpovědi: Rozhodně není jednodušší mít 2 aplikace než jednu. Pro nikoho, nikdy. | Funguje, dělá i schvalování karetních transakcí. Ale i na SGS9 je to neuvěřitelně líná aplikace, což pro pouhé push notifikace a potvrzení akce nechápu. | Minimalistická. Funguje bezchybně. Oceňuji, že je oddělená od aplikace pro Smart Banking, kterou tak není nutné instalovat, pokud člověk mobilní bankovnictví nevyužívá a chce jen komfortně potvrzovat platby kartou a přihlášení a transakce z internetového bankovnictví. | just works as expected. reliability is the most important for such app | Haven't had any problems so far | Simply works | Aplikace je svižnější, než bývalá, i když stále otevření stálé chvíli trvá. Pět hvězd by si zasloužila, pokud by bylo možné potvrzovat z notifikace přes hodinky. | Urychluje přihlášení i platby 🙂 | Fixed problem with ""rooted device"" by uninstalling ""offending"" applications (IDK why this app dares to scan the phone for any applications. Is that not a violation of GDPR?). Approving works. But, after last transacion approval, it asked me whether I like the app - I don't hate it, but I answered No and then it wanted me to tell why, which just redirected me to choose from a set of messaging apps - this is confusing, because I can choose WhatsApp (or such), which I guess you don't have. Shame | Super, quick and safe service | Stopped working, complaining that my device is rooted, which is NOT. | Tvl, to si z lidi snad delaj srandu, co je to za silenou aktivaci, a proc neni jedna appka na vsechno, jako to maj normalni banky?!? To je fakt 100 let za vopicema 😵‍💫 | Makes you jump through a million hoops, telling you you've failed to authenticate at every turn. | Dobrá aplikace. A konečně ověřuje integritu systému pomocí SafetyNetu a ne otravného ""su"". Stačilo na to upozorňovat něco málo pod rok. | Does not work with rooted device, this is how you lose clients. | I dont need 3 apps to do 1 thing | doesn't work on rooted phone | Worked well until last update. Since then it doesn't work allegedly because my phone is rooted, which it is not. This means I cannot make any online payment, which sucks | Latest update stopped working on non-rooted official LineageOS. Which means I am going away from the Smart Key back to SMS codes. It's a shame. | It's imposible to pay online for first time. Lots of errors and decline transactions. Autorisation takes a lot of time. Unfriendly experience. Please, improve it. | It works perfect! | Vůbec nefunguje na Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite (tablet), zatímco na jiných zařízeních funguje. Aplikace při přihlášení, po požadavku na potvrzení (zadání pinu) přesměruje na nějakou www ČSOB namísto toho, aby fungovala standardně jako například na Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. Jsem zklamán. | App and login error all the time, can't use it normally, absolutely tired of it. | No possibility to confirm any internet banking transactions for 6 hours on a Saturday in the summer? I wish you had sent a notification. Disaster. | ""On break due to maintenance"" is horrible thing to see when you are trying to complete a purchase of items that are quick to sell out. Maybe including some notification that there is going to be a scheduled maintenance and when? | To je zase výmysl, jak mi zrušit přístup k mým financím, aniž bych mohla že zahraničí něco ovlivnit. Hlavně, že kvůli téhle aplikaci mám stále české číslo, abych si mohla potvrdit transakce, teď už to neplatí a protože tahle aplikace selhala s první aktivací, teď nemám možnost jak se dostat ke svým prostředkům. Nemůžu najít kartu, takže si musím místo toho požádat o vydání nové karty. Určitě nedoporučuji, pokud jste v zahraničí a potřebujete podporu. | It says ""Activation failed"" and ""Check the connection"" when attempting to activate. Tried factory reset, activation through ATM and Internet Banking options, still the same result. | This app crashes very frequnelty. Please fix! | couldn't open this app for 4 days straight | No je opravdu výbornej nápad mít 2 aplikace, při vstupu do čsob smart musim zadávat pin do druhý aplikace, která je jenom na psaní pinu? Trvale odcházím od čsob k jiný bance, páč tady nic nefunguje, ani lidi ani software, čus | negunguje. trvalo to 30 minut a nefunguje to | doesn't work | great | How can a provider switch off payment request approval for like 4-5 hrs?? CSOB promissed this app would be better than the former sms code approval, but Smart Key simply isn't. It's not even close and I don't want it. Why doesn't it have any history of approved reques? Not being able to pay online??? it's such a poor experience that i am strongly considering moving to a different bank!!! BRING BACK STABLE SERVICE!! It I don't care about maintenance downtime whether it's planned or not. | Everything installed and updated but show error, service de pire en pire.. beaucoup de complications pour rien... | Dílo Kristovo. Když už funguje, je to ok. Ale rozchodit ho, to je masakr. A nedejbože změnit telefon, nebo jen otisk prstu. A máte na celý den o zábavu postaráno. | nelze skoro vubec platit pres mobil kartou, vzdy kdyz se otevre nove okno pro smart klic a zavre stranka prodejce tak to spadne a platba neprobehne | Pořád se vnucuje, ale nastavit jí prostě nejde. Kódy které dostávám v ČSOB ""Smart"" nesouhlasí. Nechápu | Velmi stupidni prechod z jedne CSOB applikace na 2 dalsi ... Za posledni dekadu asi nejdebilnejsi napad jak ""zabezpecit login"" ... Teda kdo todle vymyslel ... | Doesn't work | ČSOB Smart klíč? V čem je smart, když stojí maximálně tak za změnu banky. K čemu ta rozbitá aplikace vůbec je, když sakra nefunguje tak jak má? Buď to opravte nebo nám vraťte staré ověřování, které nestálo za vyližprdel. Jak mám provádět platby a celkově se dostat na bankovnictví, když mě Váš k hovnu ""sMarT"" klíč nepustí, 10x crashne a nedovolí mi vetšinou dostat se zpět do aplikace ve které tu platbu musím ještě dokončit. Good job ČSOB, Cirkus. | najprv mi vypisuje chybu, ze sa neco nezdarilo. po restarte uz zrazu neplati aktivacny kod ale nemozem si ho zistit lebo do smartbankingu resp. internet bankingu treba overit prihlasenie v csob smart key (ktory ale nemam aktivovany kvoli nejakej chybe aplikacie a chcem si zistit aktivacny kod)....cele zle | Aplikace je zcela zbytečná. Navíc teď jsem si koupil nový telefon a nainstalovat a nastavit tuto hrůzu společně s ČSOB Smart mobilním bankovnictvím je opravdu za trest. Celý telefon jsem měl zkopírovaný z původního a nastavený za zlomek času, co mi zabralo nainstalovat a spustit tyto dvě ČSOB aplikace. Musel jsem je obě 2x přeinstalovat než to vůbec začalo fungovat. To už by snad bylo jednodušší přejít k jiné bance a nastavit si vše od nuly. Už jsem naštvaný a to jsem ještě neotevřel ČSOB Smart | Naprosto zbytecna aplikace, ktera ani nefunguje tak, jak ma. Jestlize mam potvrzovat vsechny platby, proc nektere projdou aniz by to smart key zaregistroval? Kde je tedy to extra zabezpeceni? Nemluve o tom, ze proces instalace a aktivace mi zabral hodinu. Jak si tohle ma zaridit nekdo, kdo uz mel predtim problemy s temito ""chytrymi"" aplikacemi? Uzivatelsky naprosto unfriendly, neprehledna aplikace, ktera akorat zabira prostor v ulozisti. | I had to install this for CSOB smart banking app to start. This is its only purpose. Waste of space in my phone. Makes me angry every time I need to access my CSOB bank account from my phone. Living example of how not to do UX. | Pro spárování se musím přihlásit do bankovnictví (ne do aplikace, do desktop verze), jen aby mi aplikace napsala, že aktivace nebyla dokončena (i když jsem ji dokončovala) a abych kontaktovala helpdesk. Naprosto k ničemu. | nefungují | Ďalšia posraná aplikácia od ČSOB... vráťte autorizáciu SMS! | Should probably autoclose after confirming a payment, otherwise simple and effective app. 1* reviews are likely user imbecility. | Zbytečně komplikované. Zlatá Air Bank. | Hrozná aplikácia. Nič nepotvrdí aj keď sa tvári, že áno. Ak si ju už raz nainštalujete, už bez nej čsob apku neotvoríte. | Nefunkčná aplikácia. | This app is not working for my phone at all. Immediately when I try to approve any kind of a request I get an error, that my request expired. I can't pay via card online. The only possibilty on the internet is good old money transfer, which I must do with 'offline authorisation' only. Helpdesks advice was typical 'Have you try to reinstall it?' Yes I have, didn't help. My phone (realme) has Android (not some modification or anything) and should be compatible. | Podařilo se mi to zprovoznit a beztak se to v některý den rozhodne nefungovat, s příštím obnovením ať po nás chtějí abychom házeli kostkou, zda budeme moci něco koupit v internetu. | Absolutni fail ze vsech ceskych bank, hodne stesti kdyz se vam to uz jednou podari nahodou zprovoznit a pak se vam rozbije mobil | Aplikace jen v angličtině a po ukončení absolutně nepřehledné. Nechápu, proč ČSOB nemůže mít jen jednu chytrou aplikaci, jako to mají jiné banky, se kterou může klient pohodlně sledovat jak pohyby na svém kontu, tak s ní i potvrzovat platební transakce. Smart Key funguje jen pro potrzení indentity klienta, v ostatních sekcích tohoto appu se zobrazují jen černá pole. Vícestranou funkčnost bohužel postrádám. | Zapnout to je fakt bolest | Terrible application | Awful user experience trying to sign in | Great | Totaly useless. Been throu second time and couldnt get it into working! Stoopid. Im deff going to change the bank tommorow! | Po posledni aktualizaci aplikace pada, po reinstalovani chce povoleni z internet banking, prihlaseni vyzaduje potvrzeni v smart klic. Smart vyzaduje povoleni z internet bankingu. Zlaty potvrzovani sms klicem | Proč potřebuji tohle a není to ve smartbankingu? Máte vyloženě 9 aplikací a každá dělá to stejné, ale zároveň jinak. Doporučil bych vyvíjet jen JEDNU aplikaci ať si my, zákazníci, nemusíme stahovat takové šílené množství zbyečných aplikací...(Smartbanking je v nejlepším stavu, i když tam chybí mnoho věcí, jako jsou jednoduché push notifikace při transakcích, takže toho bych se držel a postupně vyvíjel) | The app is working fine but notifications are displayed too late...even after I have already confirmed the transaction. | Aplikácia padá, nedá sa spustiť. Pred pár týždňami fungovalo všetko normálne. Nemôžem potvrdzovať platby, najhoršia aplikácia medzi bankami | Aplikace se rozbila po aktualizaci, jediný způsob jak znovu nastavit smartklíč a zrušit starý je přes zavolání do banky nebo cesta na bankomat/pobočku. Příšerný systém v době kdy každá 2fA služba má způsob jak v takové situaci zrušit aktuální zabezpečení. Jak se může vůbec stát že projde aktualizace co zablokuje tolika lidem přístup k internetovému bankovnictví. No katastrofa. | Otisk nefunguje spolehlivě. Přihlášení do telefonu misto pin funguje skvěle, ale v aplikaci otisk nefunguje. (Přihlášení trvá dlouho.. cca na potřetí vezme otisk) | Při potvrzení se objeví ""potvrzování"" aplikace spadne a platba neproběhne | Proč chce aplikace SU oprávnění, zvlášť když je podle ní root zařízení tak nebezpečný? | Dobrá, jednoduchá aplikace | Poprvé jsem potřeboval použít offline generování kódu a ani jednou mi jej to nevygenerovalo, aplikace se zasekne. K čemu něco, co neumí ani tak elementární funkce? Proč je aplikace tak těžkopádná a proč není integrovaná ve Smartbankingu? Vážně přemýšlím o přechodu k jiné bance čistě z důvodu uživatelského komfortu. | It keeps rejecting my payment. Retarded system compared to the SMS system they used to have. | Unable to pair it with app or internet banking without personal visit of ATM or local bank. Of course unable to log into internet banking without smart key... Very anoying loop... | MUCH more secure, than SMS and you never have to enter your bank credentials to pair this app. As someone with some experience with information security, I say ""get it"". | Už asi 5. pokus nainstalovat a po „stažení” píše chybu že musím zkusit aplikaci nainstalovat znova.. | Aplikace na nekolika zarizenich hlasi, ze je offline a aktivaci nelze provest, prestoze wifi funguje, jak ma... | Aplikace nefunguje, a to i přesto, že mám Android 8. Jen se zobrazí logo ČSOB a poté celý mobil zamrzne. Díky nynější povinnosti tuto aplikaci používat je pro mě teď nemožné platit na internetu. | This app should be part of the mobile banking app. Why are there two? The map based feature for finding atms is obsolete - other very basic apps do it better. Please don't add features just because you can. I rly feel like this app is just wasting my mobile phone space 😕 | Fast, secure and convenient. | Why do we need two apps! It's utter rubbish. | Why does this app request root access every 10 seconds ❓❓❓ | Quick and easy to use. | Works as expected, no hiccups. | very easy to use and secure | Appka docela v pohodě, ale nechápu proč to není integrované do jedné aplikace (smart banking) jako to má třeba Airbank. | why is this separate app to smart banking? poor design laggy and another useless aplication that should be included in main app | Keeps crashing when settings tab is opened! Peace of junk! | Aplikace padá. Aktivovala jsem, založila, spadla. Volala do ČSOB, obnovila jsem znovu klíč, zase spadla. Můžete mi poradit co s tím? Nebudu pořád obnovovat klíč, každou hodinu? Kdy bude nějaký fix? :( | Aplikace úplně k hovnu.. Mohlo být součástí normálního smartbankingu jako to má třeba airbank. Navíc když jsem si potřeboval změnit heslo... musel jsem přejít zpět na smsky neboť s touhle kravinou to nešlo. | Hooray! Finally I can confirm the card payments on the internet without hassle with sms 💪 | 120MB aplikace na potvrzování SMS kódů. 🙄 Prosím, dělejte s tím něco. | It worked well in the beginning. But soon an update came. To update I had to remove some other applications, but SKey still needed 48 mb for update. I had only 36 mb, so could not get to my bank account, now I have to change Smart Key for better way of operating my account. Very bad experience. | Prečo je potrebná ďalšia aplikácia a nie je možné potvrdzovať prostredníctvom hlavnej smartbanking aplikácie? K čomu to je, keď na zmenu limitu v IB mi na potvrdenie dôjde SMS? | Pouze 5 mistni PIN beru jako velkou nevyhodu, vzhledem k faktu ze vetsina aplikaci vyzaduje bud 4 nebo 6 mistni PIN | Lepší než SMS, ale nechápu proč to musí být jiná aplikace než co už mám pro bankovnictví. Další věc je že čekám na nějakou notifikaci, upozornění když dělám platbu ale ono ho..o. Musite aplikaci otevrit aby se vůbec něco objevilo. Přihlášení do webového bankovnictví to stejné... Překlady obecně v ČSOB dělá někdo na koleně nebo za trest možná Google translate by bylo lepší a přesnější... | Nefunguje, nemožné použiť na prihlásenie sa. Na aktiváciu treba prihlásenie do IB, ale na prihlásenie do IB treba kľúč, demo verzia nefunguje, vypisuje správy o platbách v roku, keď som ani nemala účet a podobne. | Ta aktualizace je nezvladnuta. Dneska jsem nebyl schopen zaplatit jidlo u otesanek,eu, i kdyz jsem platbu pres smaratklic zdarne provedl. System u GoPay hlasil, ze transakce neprobehla... Zakaznik je totalne znejisten, kde je chyba, aktualizace klice, nebo GoPay vypadl, co bude priste.... Ne kazdy zakaznik ma cas na takoveto ""sluzby"". :-( | Not good | Donedávna funkční s potvrzením otiskem. Najednou chce jakýsi pin, který neznám. Takže znova aktivovat do bankomatu nebo na pobočku. A manuálně smazat data, protože UI to neumí. Jediná app, co děla takové zhovadilosti ve jménu ""bezpečnosti"". Příklad InfoSec hysterie. Mam sakra heslo, tohle je jen druhý faktor! Nejaký SMS fallback taky nic, co? Banka, kdy se jen kvůli aktualizace nedostanu do IB je výsměh! Ještě že mám root a obnova ze šifrované zálohy pomohla. Užijte si davy volání na podporu !! | Člověk musí mít extra aplikaci a ta po update nefunguje, chce to PIN kvůli nějaké migraci, ale po zadání to napíše, že error. Takže do bankovnictví se nedostanu, paráda. Přitom u Airbank, kde mám druhý účet, mi stačí jedna aplikace a nikdy se nestalo, že by nefungovala. | Qr code engine je rozbitej, dík že se nemůžu přihlásit | Po aktualizaci nefunguje. Takže se kvůli tomu nedostanu do internetového bankovnictví. Celkem na prd. Ale u ČSOB aplikací žádná novinka. Bohužel. edit jako odpověď na odpověď: dobre vedet, ze si muzu Smart Klíč znovu aktivovat v ban(K)omatu ČSOB. Akorat jsou vase instrukce trochu nejasne (nemusi se nejdriv smartklic deaktivovat? v IB, kam se momentalne nedostanu? Smart klíč se mi totiž jen načítá, načítá, ale před načtením appka crashne. takže ani nevím, jak bych v bankomatu novou aktivaci provedl. kazdopadne mi to pripomina dodgy a nečekané aktualizace za časů plateb aplikací NaNákupy... člověk vyrazil bez fyzických karet, a při placení mobilem na benzínce zjistil, že NaNákupy prošlo aktualizací a před dalším použitím je nutné stavit se u bankomatu čsob a provést opětovnou aktualizaci.... | Po updatu stale pada. U aplikaci CSOB celkem bezne. Nejen ze musite mit 3 aplikace misto jedne, nabic ani poradne nefunguji. U jine banky jsem takovehle diletantstvi fakt nezazil. EDIT: Hledat nekde bankomat kvuli reaktivaci zmrsene a v podstate zbytecne aplikace kterou vam banka v podstate vnuti, to je fakt super... Ani nepocitam kolikaty problem s nekterou z aplikaci CSOB to je... S touhle bankou koncim. Jinde mi staci jedna apka a funguje bez problemu a nemusim porad neco resit. | Never works, always crashes. | nedoporucuji. system funguje jak ma. ale nakonec to budete pouzivat jen na prihlaseni. stejne budete radsi psat sms. a pak jeste kdyby jste nahodou se dostali do situace, kde vam ukradli penezenku(s doklady) a mobil a mate novy mobil. tak SE NEDOSTANETE DO SMARTBANKINGU,PROTOZE SMARTKEY JE JEDINA MOZNOST JAK SE TAM DOSTAT! A SMARTKEY SI MUZETE UDELAT JEN PRES SMARBANKING ALE TAM SE NEDOSTANETE PROTOZE POTREBUJETE KOD A K TOMU NEMATE DOKLADY A K TOMU JE VIKEND. Budete se citit hrozne. nedoporucuji | why you don't use Google Authenticator? | Aplikace je jen k jedne veci - pro prihlasovani do bankovnictvi a veci 
okolo bankovnictvi. Vyvojari ale opomenuli fakt, ze pro potvrzeni 
internetovych plateb chodi taky potvrzovaci kody a musite opisovat 
nesmyslne dlouhe a slozite kody ze sms. Takze resi veci opet jen na pul. | Naprosto famozni! Zvlast po posledni aktualizaci. Skvela prace. Tohle mi strasne chybi u konkurence. Opisovat SMS kody je desna otrava.   Pouziva to hw-backed storage, takze zaloha /data oddilu nestaci. Nicmene aktivace pres bankomat je bezproblemova a rychla! Hodne dobre vymysleno.  EDIT: diky za podporu otisku  Dalsi kroky: pouziti aplikace v 3dsecure (platby kartou). | Quick, easy and working | Tankyou | Great app | Geniální. Po upgradu se mi aplikace deaktivovala a jelikož se teď nepřihlásím o internetového bankovnictví, můžu běžet na pobočku nebo do bankomatu (s kreditkou, ze které nevybírám)... | 1. Pozadavek na pin se neshoduje s pozadavky pro generovani pinu v bance. Nemuzu pouzit stejny pin, jakym se hlasim do bankovnictvi.  2. Nelze nastavit jazyk nezavisle na prostredi.  3. Nelze autentifikovat pomoci otisku prstu. | Pěkná aplikace, ale má několik chyb: 1. Nelze nijak pohodlně obnovit klíč, když třeba smažete data k aplikaci. Vzhledem k tomu, že mi stále stačí SMS k tomu, abych se dostal do mobilního Smartbankingu, nevidím důvod, proč by to nešlo obnovit pomocí SMS.  2. Naprosto chybí nastavení, především jazyka. Na anglickém systému z toho vyleze ošklivá míchanice jazyků. Ne, nebudu měnit jazyk telefonu, tohle patří ke standardním funkcím aplikací.  3. Na Androidu 7.1.2 není dostupná nová verze. | Chybí možnost změny jazyka...podobne jako u na nákupy... Docela elementární věc, ale stále s tím problémy :/ Ad odpověď: ano, to jsem pochopil. A to je snad důvod, aby to nebylo uživatelsky měnítelné? Telefon stejně jako PC používám v En, ale u aplikace české banky, kde celou dobu vše mám v češtině bych uvítal toto. | Po přešlapu zrušením několika funkcí webu přechodem na nové ""moderní"" stránky, pozitivní krok. Zejména možnost využití i v offline módu.   Dotaz: je možné rozšířit i na platby kartou (tzn přes bránu a SMS kód)? Update: -1 bod za chybějící​ fingerprint | Funguje, ale zatím nepodporuje otisk prstu. | A lot more convenient than SMS key. | QR code scanning doesn't work | can't even return on the previous step during registration. usability disaster :( | Bohužel funguje jenom pro transakce v rámci ČSOB Bankingu, čili když platíte kartou online u obchodníků (což dělám nejčastěji) tak dále opisujete SMS kódy a nic se nemění ... | Oveľa pohodlnejšie ako opisovanie SMS :)","{""1"":4144,""2"":384,""3"":599,""4"":1156,""5"":6148}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Československá obchodní banka, a.s.","7482510484480153842","helpdeskeb@csob.cz","http://www.csob.cz/smartklic","Radlická 333/150, 15018 Praha 5","https://www.csob.cz/portal/csob/ochrana-osobnich-udaju","7482510484480153842","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JXN_4PvcR4KHZ_5ONqC9BP4NCyxihV08Z1MiWBzee9XrnDyF3VxnybjrHVIu8BHMeA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hfkAhjFJbR6GVT-fLkBlME_lR58sUfAMfPdwEgyT9D-S4GXfIVsg2OPKHoiY7v7dIz7A","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SUxJ1SRyhVdFmoZi7cn7pQbf_9g1LApeQCuxcvJHsipOFFsPSvGQUSR66OfCjVcM0r0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H8ZDG0ZonbluLLE99r6vU-JUdP6R0at_wHfFRB40W4YMWjmLqm0sxFr3ZTiEGAv7cL3f"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sxuh1QY0t8jIMHK95E3DksmWHz5b4l9HOfEyzuIqFI69ga3NPo4BR-PQJL__b2qSTAI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PzKYw_jdkH1y7QURj65O3zpurxovtNx5qEgplXjO5pbB9KgsPTtvgyDSRMoBFSZkk3U"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a2JrkWc3df7CEPY5qSIMJXiMB5FiNW5r1pvVlm7GUNtyQuo7a48OO0cK0roL7TxW0zk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KBnPrYF-EX4FFsEwVJIEb6LeopHWgi4EhdCQF4jLySMkPurdwQ-pIuy37MYWNQOvXQ""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Aug 10, 2015",1705494068000,"VARY","Thanks for using ČSOB Smart Key!<br> <br>What&#39;s new in this release?<br>•  Small improvements<br>• Bugs fixes and stabilization<br><br>*** Do you like our free app?

Not forcing you to, I'm just asking. | So cute and we are in the living room | Me and my family love to play this game together. | Fun | Good game | Os good amazing | Cool | I made stupid stuff so I rate this game a five star | Cool App, but there are too many ads. Every 3 seconds an add comes that takes up half the screen. I'm giving it three stars though because of it's features. If the adds decrease, I'll maybe install it again.

Always black bars on every other app, sometimes where the camera is and even on hbo there are black bars on the long end of the phone. For what reason I do not know, is it really that hard to fix, even on a Google Pixel no one can do it right.... Should I switch to iPhone? | Honestly the worst app ever made, can't believe im paying for this garbage. I can't watch anything on my phone for 3 days now. Frozen black screen, audio is working. | I would like to share my experience. HBO was stealing my money. They first got to me ""free"" through my mobile operator. When I wanted to start normal usage without operator involvement hbo said it was not possible. They said I have to use another email so I created another account. I did not have the opportunity to log in to the old account, I even contacted US HBO Support with no success. After a year they were using the same card quietly taking 2x the amount they offered me kindly 1 MONTH rfnd | The only streaming service that buffers, cuts off, lags. Hbo, please fix your app, it's the only app that messes up my Samsung TV. | i like the app | Great content, awful app though. So the bad rate goes all the way for this bugging app, that doesn't even start quite often, lagging, etc. | Had many troubles with downloads not able to play offline. But last 2 months it have given me no trouble. Sooo I will go from 2 stars to 4. It's broken again, so back to 1 star 🤬 | Like all the rest and | Good | I'm changing my review and keeping it the same just because recently the platform changed AGAIN and suddenly it's not available to download at all on my country, which makes no sense because I can still use my laptop but not my TV!? Basically just giving free money the past month. | The best! | Please make other subtitles accessible too, not only the regional ones. I'm hungarian living in Slovakia and I'd like to watch the movies with hungarian subtitles and with slovakian. Otherwise I'm satisfied. Update: I hope the new max will have other subtitles too, not only czech and slovak. | Teleurstellend binnenkort einde van de ‘levenslange’ korting op HBO Max | Z z. Nig,e mm nn mm n n. T zz c not x | app keeps saying something went wrong. all other apps work smoothly | Compared to netflix, showtime or prime the app is bad. I'm not saying the movies HBO has are bad, just that the app works rough. | I understand that most people watch it on TV, but mobile UX is just terrible | Because 0 is bot an option. Why does it keep kicking me off my account? Piece of junk. | I've cancelled my sister subscription and uninstalled this app 100 times, why for does it keep returning | Sensational | Terrible app, just doesn't work. For example I start a show, and there is no sounds, it's laggy, slow and the user interface is awful. Make it better, now ! | Constant stuttering ruining the experience | Your 5th 2nd is 5th and 10th to ⚄ | Cannot register and payment failed | How can such a massive company with so much money make such a dogshit app. Just trying to cast 1 episode of something to a chromecast needs at least 1 app restart because the cast button bugs out. Then 4 minutes of loading time between every press. On almost every other app it's a flawless 10 second process. | When every streaming service have the ability to run in the corner of your screen as a overlay while you play games or do other things but HBO max don't. | Best app ever always something to watch. | Go away! | wanted in red d | Dear HBO Max Team, I'm writing to express my strong desire for the expansion of HBO Max services to all countries. As a fan of your content, it's frustrating to see geographical limitations hindering access to your platform. By making HBO Max available globally, you would not only satisfy existing fans but also tap into new markets eager for your premium entertainment offerings. I urge you to consider this expansion to ensure that audience worldwide enjor the content that hbo max has to offer. | How bad can an app be in 2024? A shame to humanity | Waste of space and time | Worst of all | Doesn't even start, saying 'no connection'. | Lousy | Goog | My subscription was cancelled, where are my money back ? | Why is it still on the App Store? | Terrible app, it crashes all the time in multiple different devices | Warner sunsetted Hbo Max in the Caribbean and sent messages saying that the same service was available with Max. However, I can no longer use this app and the Max app is not available in my country, eventhough I am paying the subscription and should have access through my provider. I have reached out to them on their website and e-mailed. Hopefully this is just a glitch due to the transition. | The worst app ever. To connect it with Chromecast just miracle. But if you did, don't expect that it's gonna work how you expect. Sometimes app won't play movie, or can't change some movie settings. And company still didn't fix it. Shame. | U m. m. | Si lo e usado | Tak e it away | Cast icon not showing. Super annoying. | the app experience on my phone is horrible | App is buggy and slow. | Learn to Philadelphia | I can't put subtitles and app fails many times to share with Chromecast | Casting don't work from my Android phone. No problems with other streaming apps. | Je | No HDR content :( | The worst app ever! Subtitles can be added, but sometimes. You have to restart app several times until subtitle applies. Slow, buggy and unstable. A waste of time and money | hbo mazx Aewsome I love it | Excellent job | The catalogue is great, but the app is the worst! Always crashing, having subtitle issues, the image sometimes just won't appear in the casting (just the sound) are some exemples of how bad it is, they surely need to work on making it better, but apparently it's not a big priority | Could be a lot better. | Hella good | What's New in each version of your app?. | I have moved to a location where the service is not available, I can't access any form of support/help or login to the account. So it means that when travelling the service can't be used. I advise everybody who is moving around a lot to think twice when subscribing/using this service. There is no customer support either. Can't watch it in amazon fire tv either. It seems that Hbo Max is planning to go down soon with such a service! | I have had nothing but problems with this new app, but I had problems before, but this is worse than HBO MAX. After watching a episode of a series, I cannot scroll to see other options. It freezes up. I sent a video, got a reply email, but I have decided that I will try to watch another month and not renew. You would think, Time Warner could remedy issues quickly, but I have used two other movie apps and not had issues. I thought this app on my computer would be worth the money, but wrong. | Good App!! | Great app | Bad for years | I purchased the subscription some time ago in Europe. In May 2023 I moved to South America. In December 2023 my subscription stopped working and I was told that because I had moved I had to purchase a new subscription. I did this via the google play store with the country set correctly to the new country I was in. I paid in the local currency. Recently, due to the change from HBO Max to Max, it stopped working and I was told that my 12 month subs is no longer valid and I have to get a new one. | lol they scam me 😂 | Despite my active subscription I am getting a message saying this app is no longer available in my country. I will be seeking a refund. | Casting to Chromecast is a pain in the *** | Reflects badly on hbo. Full of bugs. Download management doesn't work. Film selection was much more disappointing than expected. Difficult to navigate ie. Browse an episode list of a show I'm currently watching. Often disconnects whilst I'm still casting. Parental controls won't stop a child watching restricted content unless it is already on the child account. | Easy to use | App often closes when changing apps/multitasking. Doesn't want to change between portrait/landscape when in fullscreen. Technically the worst app when considering the big streaming suppliers. Update: Now also with stuttering! | It's slowest app possible, website is slow as well......... Just optimise it man, impossible to use it | After changed to max it stopped to work in Portugal, the same issue is happening in the Samsung tv apps. | Great movie's | HBOmax was available in my region and I have a subscription. Now the change to Max, I try to download and it's telling me not available in my region/country. And it said available in the Caribbean when I checked the website. So disappointing. I don't even know what happened to my subscription with HBOmax . I don't know how to cancel. | So many issues with no subtitles, incorrect audio tracks, slow casting etc. | Cea mai slaba aplicatie de streaming dintre toate | Awful | I think that the movie selection is getting rather poor. It is difficult to find a movie worth watching on this platform, and when I finally do the app is frequently interrupting my video streaming as it's force stopping for no obvious reason. I'll probably cancel my subscription very soon. | This app has migrated to max and is no longer functional | Veeery slow and laggy UI. Very oftenly just throws No connection error when wifi works fine. Overall UX very poor, you should learn how to make streaming app from Netflix, Disney or SkyShowtime | Ok 👍 👌 9 | La app dejó de funcionar hasta que la nueva ""Max"" esté disponible. No hay razón para el cambio y ahora no tengo acceso al contenido | Was good but now I can't log, it says that I need to install Max app and it's not available in Slovenija, only HBO Max it's available,big lol | Cuando entro a ver un contenido me aparece un mensaje que dice ""Algo ha ido mal"". He probado por WiFi y datos, cerrando la app, borrandola... y nada | I'm paying for a service I can no longer use apparently HBO MAX and MAX are now one I was automatically logged out of my account saying to install the MAX app however it is not available in my country? I would like yo discontinue my subscription | A couple of things have improved over time. But overall it's just a terrible streaming experience. The app is completely unresponsive when trying to cast to Chromecast. I usually connect, disconnect and restart the app a few times every time I want to cast something. That's not annoying at all... | It a great app is all I can say | Not useful | I would give 0 stars. Despite of the TV (Samsung, Sony) and the version it just doesnt work. Just this week had to uninstall and install 3 times, cause the app is locked and shows just one comment: not connected to the servers. I never had such situation with any other application. EDIT: today unistall and install process again, so its 4 times in 7 days... EDIT 2: now the uninstall and install process is happening once per day. EDIT 3. Nothing works. Bravo! | Trrrible app | Until a week ago the app was fine,now just says no Internet/wifi when there is,very confusing and no one to speak to . | Dados de acesso do HBO max não está funcionando no MAX dentro do aplicativo, só funciona no site do MAX | aumentaram os preços e reduziram a entrega, horrível | Hello, I would like to know if the language settings will remain the same when changing hbomax to max. The question is because at home, the language we speak is English; The HBOMAX app is configured in English, the movies or series are configured in English, apart from that, we also put the subtitles in English when it is difficult for us to hear or because it is very late at night. There are few occasions when we change the subs to Spanish. | Horrível | Awesome, will be missed | So now I have to download a new app that is not even ""available in my region"" to finish my series? Clearly I won't be able to do that. Not happy | Are you kidding me? I can't access to the app neither download te new one????? | it just doesn't work on Android TV¡!!!!! | I get that you're migrating, but why can't I watch anything just because of that? What a pain... | La ame, extrañare el morado distintivo 💜 | The app and the whole payment system, plus trying to log in in a different platform is really badly developed. Unsubscribing just because of how awful it is to try to deal with it. | the content is good, but the interface is horrible and unstable, at least create something decent | App horrível | Aunque la programación es buena, sigue siendo la peor plataforma (tecnología) de streaming. | App sometimes does not load subtitles options. Chromecasting randomly stops working once a few hours. That's okay for open source but not for a commercial app you pay for. | I hate the app, it's super difficult to use cause it will crash every 3 seconds, so annoying. | Experiencia terrible. La aplicación para tablets es pésima y muy poco estable. Ahora quería ver una serie, pero no siquiera puedo iniciar sesión. Buen contenido, pero muy mala app. | It's ok, I tried singing in and it didn't let me. I wanted to watch a movie and I had to sign in. So, I thought I'd write a review. But, the experience is fine. | 🤕🤕🤕 can be better | s very bad d,t work | Why do I have to be connected to the internet while watching TV Series I have downloaded previously...? | I tried Netflix, Disney+ and this app it's perfect for me. On Netflix they had the seasons I was interested in but they weren't complete, after buying this masterpiece I can finally see each season and episode of my favorites show. | How to resolve black screen on hysense vidaa tv when play movie over hbo max?Connected android phone with tv over screen sharing | Dobra aplikacija ali toliko ima pederskih filmova da je neupotrebljiva. | No deja ver contenido offline en Android, funciona muy mal | Great app to watch the best shows in television and up to date movies. A lot to choose from with more added daily it seems. | The performance of the app is really horrible. Navigating through the menus is really painful. Also, if there are downloads on a device, and you need to reinstall the app, it is impossible to download more content in the recently installed app. | REALLY LOVE IT GOOD MOVIE TV HBOMAX | why abandon this app? | Aplicación muy lenta. | Perfect | Doesn't wor, can't log in.... | keeps stopping and saying there is no internet connection... (I sent this review through fax, obviously) | Laggy app,not much fun to use | Quality could be better. Even most important series, like Succession looks more like 720p than 1080. It's 2024 everything should be 4K by now. No other issue here. | I tried everything from erase cookies and cache, and reinstall the app, and that didn't work. Again, an useless app. That's a shame taking into account how big and good is HBO content. | Se está travando. Você tem que reiniciar o APP. Bem horrível isso. | La aplicación para TV tiene un bug, con algunas series y películas el audio NO PUEDE SER EN INGLÉS ya que no las reproduce, si se cambia el audio si las reproduce, version de Hbo 54.10.0(sin actualizaciones pendientes al día de hoy) Android versión 10 | Cancelling the subscription after this month because it's a struggle to play the video on phone. | HBO Max is one of the most used apps in my house! It has all the shows and movies you could ever want! Options for everyone in the house Toddlers, teenagers, or adults! We're able to stream on multiple devices all at the same time. It is 100% worth the monthly subscription!! | This app is just broken. Uninstalled, installed and so on. Opens, slow, and never plays a video, just black screen with sound. | Horrible experience. The Google Cast integration is terrible. Subtitles don't work, loading takes ages. Probably the worst streaming application I've used so far. It's a real shame given the great content. | Worst app ever, constant error reading. App continues to close while watching series. Also even with deleting app and reloading and restart cell app still fails. | Jedna z najgorszych apek streamingowych jakie miałam nieprzyjemność używać | Content is great but the application is completely useless and sad. | More 4K content would be nice, but overall good. I've good internet speed, no issues here | good | Love the content, the price is relative low. However the app on Apple and Android devices is really buggy, laggy, glitchy and very unstable, it crashes a lot and says theres no internet connection while this is not the case. I feel like my little niece could develop a better application... After 4 years you'd expect an app that at least lets you watch content without constant crashes... It gets really tiring. Please fix issues!!! | 😑 | A HBO tem ótimos títulos pra assistir, as séries e filmes são muito bons. Mas... O app é HORRÍVEL, trava quando tô assistindo, faz meu celular desconectar da internet do nada, mesmo eu estando do lado do modem, nenhum outro app faz isso... E o pior é que isso não é só pra celulares.. no meu Playstation e mas tvs aqui de casa acontece a mesma coisa... Tem que trabalhar muito nesse app, mas não tem como avaliar mais que isso | Audio description is default. Your development team is a mess. F you | Bad phone app. Even more bad tv app. Cea mai proasta aplicatie instalata de mine. Si nu sunt vorbe mari. Pe langa aplicatia asta, cea de la netflix e de o mie de ori mai buna. Nu-mi vine sa cred ca pot exista asemenea diferente! | Honestly, hire a better team to fix the bugs in the app. There's a black screen on play mode, gets stuck in the downloads tab. The only thing working is the ipad/Airplay. | i have no issues with the app.. don t get the hate | Carrollton ga | The app is just bad | You must close and redesign this usefulness app. | Is imposible to connect over my WiFi connection. Similar apps can connect faster. Really I spent money an it doesn't work. Troubleshooting is usefulness. | AWESOME!!! | Good content. But I face a problem. When I watch on phone, after each episode, my phone hangs. I have to open the app again. | Works almost. Too many bugs. Too slow. Search function on actors, actress and director not very good. I would start creating better search functionality. I find all the best movies and series by coincidence. | Runs extremely unstable and changes language and subtitle settings when casted to a chrom cast. Extremely disappointing and uselles. Good content the days the !@#$ app works | Fix Dolby Atmos for Philips Android TV!!! | Love it | True detective newest episode forces audio description when casting. I know you will suggest that the problem is with connectiong or something, but everything else works other than this episode, even when it is locally downloaded. The problem is not with chromecast, or wifi, it is in your app. There are several people reporting this same issue, maybe just fix it instead of directing people elsewhere? | Will the HBO MAX on the Appstore will update to MAX wen Launch on Febuary 27 2024 | Even downloaded episodes run badly | Unstable app. Freezed my phone few times, I will unsubscribe from the hbo max service because of this if it happens one more time. | The app takes ages to fully open, I've to close and open the app several times to cast to my tv cuz my device never appears on the app. I have a good internet connection but the app just won't respond. Fix all this bugs ASAP, cuz I'm paying for it. Thank you. | I'm always having problems with this app. So much time spent trying to find solutions and it's very frustrating. | was awesome as hbo max but max sucks | Cant watch with out audio description on since 19/2-24 | If I could give this app less than one star, I would. Just some issues: There is no stability when connecting over wifi, with the signal often cutting out repeatedly. Reconnecting then clears your settings for subs etc or signs you out completely. The stream switches to audio description without this option being selected The app cannot keep a clean list of home devices All in all, poor. World class content, second class platform - and seems no desire to fix beyond meaningless platitudes. Awful. | Have not had any yet ex done enter | Slow, worst streaming app ever | Una basura. Imposible que anden los subtitulos transmitiendo con el chromecast, de no creer | GUI sucks, Chromecast issues when other apps works. Hard to go into episodes lost in a season from the screen video is playing | Please make this available to Phillips tv's. | This app seems to be written by a high school drop out while drunk. Unstable, laggy, slow and no handle of time outs or lack of perfect internet access. | Enabling subtitles while using chromecast also enables visually impaired audio track ,and app does not allow to change back to original audio tracks while casting. Additionally it is Impossible to install and run this on an amazon firestick in sweden, probably same developer team responsible for that issue. | How can an app be THIS bad? | So many bugs when streaming to Chromecast | This is by far the most buggy app I have ever used, so unbelievably buggy that it is borderline unusable, I sadly had to stop using HBO for this :-( ... Plz fix it | Subtitles often don't work. The language list appears, but unable to select anything. Other times there are no language options available. Disconnecting Chromecast + restarting the app multiple times fixes it. In addition, the app has recently started turning on audio descriptions. Impossible to turn off, the GUI simply don't respond. Just cleared cache + app data, but still stuck with the robot voice. I'm so fed up with these bugs that will likely not be fixed anytime soon, so I quit. | Glitchiest app ever, terrible when it comes to being to enable/disable subtitles and audio description. Has ruined many a movie night | Chromecast only streams with audio description enabled. No way to turn it off. Even if I start by turning it off while playing on my phone and then casting it goes back to audio description. | Errors all the time!!! | App still runs as smooth as sandpaper in a bucket of cement but now the content is also messed up. True detective episode released with only the descriptive audio, really? Is the bare minimum quality assurance really too much to ask of a paid subscription service? Or is it up to the intern to drag a couple files in a folder somewhere or something? | Never been happy with how the app functions, but now this boggles the mind and is super annoying. When I want to watch the last episode of true Detective night country and I cast it from my phone it inexpiably shifts to English audio- description. It doesn't seem to do this for other content and also only when I cast it. Awful app, at best it barely functions. | Trash app, it's so bad | Love | Honestly the experience is quite disappointing, the biggest issue is that sometimes (most of the time actually...) when you're watching a show and it automatically plays the next episode, it will buffer/hang intermittently. It gets fixed by reopening the app (sometimes only after multiple attempts...) | Full of bugs not user friendly at all. Really subpar | Chromecast experience is terrible. Doesn't show link, doesn't reconnect. Terrible. | Muitos problemas com conexões. Péssima experiência | Do not work with Android 8.0 tablets (Huawei M5) and will not allow instaling and running earlier compatible versions... | Love it! | Glitchy and slow. Jumps back and forth in episodes when pausing, sometimes it starts a random episode, sometimes it randomly switches to portrait mode, sometimes when an episode ends it skips one and starts the next. | I have not watched hbomax from my phone in a while and now I am requested to sign in again and re-enter vendor contract id. If i try to watch from my phone, it means i'm away from my tv and also from my vendor contracts. | This apps just only use for the phone.

Your feedback is music to our ears, and it helps us make Shazam even better.","[""I dont usually do reviews, but I love the Shazam app. I use it almost every day. Since music is a huge part of everyday life, it's great having a tool to find the one song you hear at the supermarket/restaurant. Or settling a little debate between friends on which song is playing at the bar. One thing that is annoying me is that I have to continuously turn on my settings for the notification bar. When I came to make the review, I noticed I needed to update the app. Hopefully, it helps."",""I hoped that by downloading this , it would be a useful tool I could use to identify songs on Facebook reels that I hear and enjoy and wish to support. However, I have shazammed dozens of times, and it has not once, not one single time, identified the song correctly. As far as I am concerned, this app is useless trash and a complete waste of my time."",""It was and is a great app, but needs some bug fixes. It keeps getting stuck in external mode, where it only tries to idenfy external songs, not the music playing in the device. It used to identify and switch between device song or external song mode automatically, but sometimes it does not. I identified the problem could be due to location permission. Not sure why it needs this permission to identify device music. But it should provide a switcher in the settings due to strictier permissions ..."",""The auto function doesn't seem to work as well as it used to. \""Tap to Shazam\"" works great. I can have it on auto, let a song play, and nothing. As soon as I switch to \""tap\"", it names the song immediately. UPDATE- 3/7/24: At some point in the last couple of years, they fixed it. Auto-Shazam now works great, and it shows you a banner of any song it picks up. Changing rating from 3 stars to 5. I was actually watching a rerun of \""Newhart\"" and Shazam recognized the theme song and notified me."",""Wow what in heaven's name has happened to the Shazam app? It now takes forever to find a song and at best, the song is not found, even though I have googled and found the song, Shazam continues searching and flagging that it can't be found, unbelievable. All these really good apps appear to have lost their way. Such a huge disappointment. I use the music in Shazam as a playlist reminder of some brilliant tunes playlist when my listening time is limited.""]",false,false,false,"com.shazam.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android&hl=en&gl=CZ"
"Microsoft Authenticator","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication
Multi factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless
Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill
Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts
Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.

Optional Access permissions: 
Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq
Accessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.
Location: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.
Camera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.
Read the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue.","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill.

I have tried to sync numerous times (same user account), only to realize the apps on both devices arent synced despite being logged into the same account.

I thought maybe the system gave priority to my previous phone or something like that and tried to uninstall the app on my previous phone. Now I can't do anything"",""So it only prompts to provide/autofil my password on maybe 20% of login pages/apps aka when I actually need a password.... Otherwise most password prompts for saved password are when you open random text boxes like instagram comments.. but rarely when you actually need em, so ya gotta go jump between apps to reference your password list manually... update them manually.

It's free so.. yeah"",""With all the recent need for 2 factor authentication and/or more complicated passwords... this app comes in handy. I avoided more complicated security for a long time & this app changed my view. I highly recommend moving into the age of password keepers and authenticators. Many of us think it is more convenient to remember the same few passwords, but the new convenience is using fingerprints. It's important to have many backup options, so please take your time deciding what those may be for you."",""Got a new phone and now the app won't work anymore. I can't put the two-digit code in anywhere on the app because the screen never shows up for me. It's just the same sign in screen as on the computer.

"YouTube Kids","A video app made just for kids
YouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids

A safer online experience for kids
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
Keep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
Blocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.
Flagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Create individual experiences as unique as your kids
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. 

Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.

All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids
Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.

Parental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.

Thanks!!! | Google is very good | I've used Avast for years on my PC and my phone. Best anti-virus I've ever had, well worth it. | Easy and effective | Very thorough! I feel confident that my tablet is protected. I haven't had this long, but so far very impressed. At first, there is a lot of stuff to shift through. You may feel a bit overwhelmed. However, once you figure out all you have it all falls into place. I opted for the ultimate version, which costs the most. That price by the way, is very reasonable......$6.00 and some change per month. I strongly recommend this for your security and peace of mind. | Like Kaspersky, it's a resource hog but with ads! Great protection for malware(this is your 2nd option for antivirus) I ain't gonna buy premium so stop shoving ads towards my face, I ain't hating the app(it's great for day to day use) I just hate ads. Background scanning is finicky(this goes for any antivirus since background scanning is resource intensive for some devices) | the very worst thing about this app is those annoying ads!!! I just need to clean my phone and no need to watch the whole shopping links!! maybe this link needs money but the ads annoyed the hell out of me!!! is like I don't buy those ads or watch the ads, I can't clean my phone!! this app is supposed to help people and not annoying us!!! | Loving it! | SLOWS PHONE DOWN AND HAS WAY TO MANY POPUPS | Avast mobile security is an exceptional app. I by chance gave a thumbs down on the in app review but I did not mean to give a thumbs down. I wanted to give a thumbs up. Actually I was too quick at selecting it and thought it was a thumbs up initially. Sorry for that. It is an excellent app. Please keep the thumbs up sign on the in app review on the left so it appears as the first option when someone has to select it. | App works fine & requests permission to run scans for potential problems. 1 negative-it keeps asking to add additional software at additional $... | Avast sends many spam messages. | Quick and easy | Avast is nothing but a W , even if you can't buy premium avast free version is goated W avast | It's keeping me unwanted out | They're very good | best antivirus ever,my sis use it to not go to malicious web, thanks avats many more steps to go | good | I like the app. It's does so far get rid of junk mail.

Uninstalled app few times and still nothing happen | Good apps for my phone. | It do great | I just installed the app and it flagged ""Cake Wallet"" app that I had been using for a while!

It lost my trust, I'm uninstalling... | Everything you could want protected, as you decide exactly what | very good app. | Very good app! | It works smoothly. I enjoy this app it's been helpful. | Can't fault this app. It gives peace of mind while not being obtrusive. | Easy to use, efficient and reminds me to scan regularly | Security for mobile and your network is GREAT! | Good | Flawless | It keeps .me protected | No complaints.

How come nobody has responded 2 my question 😥💔 I also need 2 know that everything on my phone is safe & is unable 2 b seen by this App. | Just started with this app let's see if it works like it says it does | The free version told me there were threats that i needed to get rid of by purchasing premium. I then purchased and scanned and there were no threats. Don't get caught out the same way. Look online at the issue you have first, you probably dont need this. | Very good | I have Avast on my PC and phones for constant protections. | Easy and friendly software | I love this app. It's user friendly. | Satisfied | Good | Very good nice. No problem with this App. Avast. It does what it says now. All.

Addendum: I removed this program immediately upon noticing. | Very good app i love with this app i uninstalled 12 Malware's | Good app | good. | Not bad | works as it should with no interruptions or popups | Excellent feel safe | Supper app | Avast is almost it's own virus always interrupting other phone programs. I get continuous pop ups also. | It's a well regarded web security utility that has demonstrated its effectiveness. | My app isn't accepting the activation code and I requested help already from support. Hence the 4 stars. Otherwise very happy with it on my PC. | So far the program is working good for the free part of it. I don't have the money to pay for apps. I can only use free apps. | Very nicely app 😺😸 | Feel very secure with Avast looking out for me | Services are okay.... | Very easy and quick to use. Great app | On Samsung and Motorola phone (main phone) & Samsung tablet. Bought subscription on offer.

My phone runs so much better than it did before. | Can you please stop spamming me with the 'Continue with Ads' option, it's not resisgtering my choice to continue with Ads, and it's making my device glitch and crash. | I like this program there are just too many fees for the protection. Their should be one large package with one price for all your protection. I'm not sure how long I will have this plan. | Your app of Avast is the best of the best of the best nothing better out there . | Great app. It makes me feel safe and secure | 2½ years later, still 5 stars | Sent me a notification to buy subscription for ""extra privacy"" as soon as a I went on [REDACTED] | Seems to do it's job well reasonably priced too | So far it has been okay at best. I'm not exactly sure if it does catch threats or stops viruses/malware, or if my phone's own software does the job. The VPN really drains the phone battery. The cleanup portion for the phone does work great, so for that I'm in the middle. | Good application 👍 | Awesome app | best secuirity app | Works great | No hacking worries at all knówing I have Avast protection. | I originally gave it 5 stars but I recently started using the pin security which protects individual apps and every time I start to enter my pin I get a message that the pin is incorrect and theres a timeout. I get the message sometimes when I've only entered 1 digit but usually when I've entered 2 digits but not when I manage to enter all the digits, and I'm sure I'm entering the right numbers. It is very annoying so I'm going to disable it. | It's great. Have used Avast for years. | Was i charged twice I was,I would like to know if I was please fix.and let me know, thanks.. .. | Trust me this is the best🙌 | Pretty decent FREE virus app. I've been using for over a year now and I'm happy with it! | This application is malware when I did scan from my email it said I had all these viruses so I bought it and then all them viruses did not show up at all and now it's hacked all my emails and I'm getting blowed up with spam now it's ruined 2 of my phones . Do not purchase this it's a phishing app. And no thank you I don't want your help doing anything except giving me a refund of my money . Please refund my money | nice job... seeling our informations | Great application | Excellent | Excellent... | Excellent | Good | Good | Value of Money | Simple, fast and excellent customer service.

Fix your stuff guys, because at this stage even Yellowstone won't sell it. | You increase the subscription price , ok. Its time to see the improve of quality - 4k , hdr ! You are the only streaming service that doesnt bring even one 4k movie/series. But the price increases to same or more as other streaming services that offers this. P.S: for the brainless people that says they have a subscription with 2€/month for life : its 50% discount for standard price.

How about adding an I would like to watch but is not available yet section? Somewhere in feedback menu. Also why only support chrome browser to change payment and other advanced setting? Not fair to force a specific browser on users. | lags...no audio... | no more sound | I don't know what happened but today on 13 of March I don't have any sound from the application on my Philips TV.every other streaming application work perfectly. | no audio at all on Android TV. such a disappointment | Aplicația de pe TV nu funcționează corespunzător în sensul ca filmele nu au sunet, nu înțeleg de ce. Am testat toate platformele și doar în skyshowtime întâmpin aceasta problema. Ca ""remediere"" trebuie sa dau din aplicația de pe telefon pe TV sa vad filmele cum trebuie, adică sa aibă și sunetul. | Top movie | Love This 💕 | excellent streaming | Stutter and crash often on multiple different TVs... | so far ok app. but the image quality is not nearly as good as fx Netflix. I'm on a 1Gbit connection, so bandwith isn't the reason. | Select English language, plays in English for 2 seconds, then switches to some random la language! | The app runs smoothly and it's worth it! I'd only recommend to make a playstation app, so that it can be usable on playstation. | On a old android 5.1 It doesn't play video if I change audio language. | Very limited in the number of movies and series. Other competitors offer more for the same amount of money. After paying a subscription for a year now, I expected things will change. Audio and video quality is poor too. Disappointed. If nothing will change in the upcoming months will consider to leave the platform. | Płatne | Perfect for my travels | Casting to tv does not allow to change language. Really annoying | Subtitle is too small to read it properly | Han cambiado el pago de la gente que empezo la subscription al principio, de 2.99 a 3.99 al mes, decepcionante para la variedad de cosas que tienen... cancelare | It is not able to play any video | Din 23 aprilie 2024 oferta pe viata cu 2 euro nu va mai exista, deci nu e pe viata, mincinoșilor, pretul va creste, la 3 euro.

Peeero; la plataforma esta mal optimizada; SIN CARGA DE BUFER, no compatible con dispositivos medianamente antiguos... por estas cosas seguimos viendo Netflix. No parece tan dificil de entender...O dispones de una conexion excelente o preparate para cortes frecuentes. Se ve que han invertido en los ultimos taquillazos, pero yo dedicaria parte de ese dinero al reproductor y la compatibilidad. Aun les queda camino.... Sin duda alguna tu dinero esta mejor en disney | Painter | Gold | Android app does not work with Chromebook as it opens only with phone layout. Can you please support resizable and tablet layout on Chromebooks? | It jams terribly on a Philips TV. Chromecast casting works even worse than the installed app. | ""Woman in the wall"", released completely in sept 2023, ...in platform available only 2 episodes...!?! | Cannot manage my payment preferences on my tablet. There is no way to know if all episodes are available of a season, I only binge wach, do not want to watch episodes weekly. On my lg tv the sound quality is poor, only dolby surround while other streaming services have dolby digital. Menu is confusing as well, pressing left/right to switch tabs scrolls up/down. Subtitles lag behind audio for some content. Amount of content could be better,lots of old movies not much new. | I cancelled my subscribtion after using this app for 3 hours ... pathetic, this is a scam. | I created an account and I couldn't see the content, every time I log in after I activated the account it says to me to make a new subscription, I talked with the help support and they said to me that I made the account on the wrong email, when I activated my account with my good email. Just some thieves that lie to you. I do not recommend at all. | Mostly just black screen whenever i want to watch something, on chromebook. Will randomly crash or freeze, and no its not my connection. Most shows and films can be found on other services and cheaper. So probably wont be coming back to this one. | Some issues with this app. First of all it can drain your battery in a couple of hours compared with other streaming apps that you hardly feel were running. It also makes the phone really hot. And second it crashes oh so often. Just crashes with a generic message. | Wat een ouden troep zonde van je geld | Its not working on my tv | A lot of content for a good price but the experience is terrible - subpar unresponsive app, few controls, playback constantly freezing even with a fully downloaded movie / episode. It's been quite a while and there has been no improvement. | you could copy some ok , platform like. paramount. is the company not working for the same people. instead is a copy of peacock platform. which is one of the worsts. | Very poor quality of the application. Installed it on EON TV Box with latest updates - the app itself loads but playing content leads to frequent TV flashing(black screen) like every 10-15 seconds. I wondered why it is so mu cheaper than HBO and Disney+- apparently the poor quality is the reason. | trash app | Audio is desynced on Star Trek Deep Space 9 season 3 episode 11. I don't actually think the app is bad, I just didn't find a place to report the issue. Guessing that bad reviews are read more often. I'll remove it in about a week, regardless if it's fixed or not | Very unstable app. Selecting multiple downloads will crash app. Start of paused player will crash app. List of episodes is not fully available on tablet in landscape mode ... Please fix this prototype ... | It's bad, and I can't cancel my membership | It doesn' work fine at all with my Philips Ambilight. In fact, it made my tv freeze in YouTube. I thought it broke. Then made all apps to stutter. The movie stutter in the app, too. I unistalled it and everything is fine now. I also have it on an LG tv and it works fine there. I am pretty dissapointing. | Nem tölti le az appot, kb 10 szer próbáltam két eszközön is | Love the content and app. Works well on all my devices | Horrendous autoplay of next title, that can't be turned off. | there is no app for Vidda - Hisense TV 😔 | 👍 Good | How to change the language to something other than the country where I'm staying | Edit: Language update happened! Please push an update to start using the device language instead of language based on geographical location. | Great content. Stable app | 2 euro for life :)) best deal ever | Bad captions, was watching trilogy and it just disappeared without notice, totally just removed out of existence. Nice... Technically app decent with chromecast. | Great app, please let me watch also with Brazilian Portuguese audio! | So, so terrible! Used to work fine on my Chromebook, and now it is miniscule like a tiny phonescreen and cannot be resized to fit my full screen! Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it doesn't help. Customer service have proven to be of NO help previously with other issues, so I guess this is a waste of time now, and I will just unsubscribe. How is it possible that people can take money for a job so poorly done? | Terrible app. Everytime i go back home during playback it freezes the whole phone. I have s23 ultra so no cheap phone. | It's exactly like Netflix or almost you need to pay to wach I'd rather pay for Netflix. before i decided to change the app I used before surfnet is way better its free | Not optimized for an android phone. (Keeps playing when you get a call, switches pages between 'episodes - more like this - extras' when try to scroll down. ) and the download files are unnecessarily large. Good content and well worth the price. | Can't turn off autoplay next episode, so you can't watch the credits. | Fix the sound, NO Dolby of any type. Philips TV and Denon AVR-X2700H | The app is faaaaast | The app is utter garbage. Stutters, buffers, skips. Please fix. Starting to feel like a scam. | The app keeps crashing like crazy, even navigation is difficult; content is not bad but somewhat limited. Happy to keep using if you fix the app. | Slow, not good UX | excelente. | It neither has an app for fire stick nor allows mirroring from the tablet. Therefore I have to either watch it on a small screen or connect an HDMI from the computer as if we're in 2006. Pathetic. | please upgrade the content audio with Dolby 5.1. I just saw a movie with 2.0 with original English sound while there was 5.1 polish or Hungarian secondary sound | love it very good | netflix from wish | Not working on h96max | Cannot save downloads properly to external storage. Basic feature. | App works flawless, and I found so much to watch on it. Very sarisfied. | Very Good | I installed the app on my Philips TV but got really bad stuttering. We have not experienced this with any other streaming service and I contacted customer support. After a few basic steps such as restart they blamed my TV even though every other streaming app works fine. I asked if they had any known issues regarding stuttering and lag and they said no. After reading reviews here it seems they are either oblivious or uninformed of the performance issues in the app. I hope this is fixed soon. | This app is 100% peeing in to paying customers' cereals. You can't cancel your subscription from the app. You have to navigate yourself to the website and sign in and cancel it from there. But lo and behold! It's not that easy if you try to do it on your mobile which has the app also since when you sign in on the website, your mobile automatically open the app... | It works but audio and video formats seem to be poor. No Dolby Atmos, no Dolby Vision, no HDR. I was however able to get the experience to Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Overall UX works. | You really need to improve the quality of the image and sound for the content. It's terrible...It is 2024, what about 4k, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos? | Awesome app 💕 | no Xbox app | Reseña actualizada enero 2024. Aún hay problemas al añadir ciertas películas o series a mis favoritas, da error y no se guarda, incluso después de varios intentos. La calidad del audio y video sigue faltando, muy debajo de todas las otras plataformas de streaming. | Just downloaded the app, cannot watch a single movie..the movie is loading for ages, when it does after 30 sec it happens again..why paying at all?! | I watch over Chromecast and works fine. Also watching on my android is no problem. But I recently purchased a projector wambo X5 with android 9 some kind of TV OS. It starts to flicker when I want to sign IN. An crashes the app when hitting a play button. Would be awesome if it will be fixed in the future. As I said Chromecast in HDMI projector is OK. Thanks in advance | Really good streaming service with excellent customer relations. | 👍 | Love the app but can we get some settings for subtitles ? For some reason for this app the subtitles comes with black background and takes a lot of space. Maybe we can get some subtitles with no background and have a font size to pick from. Thanks | Great movies and series and I've never had any problems with the app. | app seems unstable/losing connection to the TV when streaming | Atrocious app | No way to remove titles from continue watching | fast becoming my favorite streaming App | should work on firestick normally... not woth workarounds | So now I need to learn czech in order to use the application, just because skyshowtime wants that! Where is the english interface? I prefer Original English titles of 5h3 movies!! This is ridiculous! | awesome | Transformers 2023....terribles.... | Will autoplay anything.... have shows, films i don't want to watch stuck in my view list. Needs more options so you can remove stuff. | I'm trying to watch Yellowjackets 2 and the screen is so dark that I will stop watching and cancel the subscription. And no, it is not a phone' setting issue. | bc ok | Very buggy, especially the subtitles. Rather disappointed they you removed the Friday the 13th movies. | generally ok. but there are problems with the subtitles, the settings specified in the webpage are not always respected(eg. a black background for the subtitles). in fact, it's quite silly that such settings are not accessible in the app directly and that a webpage has to be accessed! | In aplicația de Android nu am reusit sa vizionez nici măcar 10 sec (din nici un film/serial). Apar coduri de eroare pentru care nu există suport. Aplicația cere acces la locație, ceea ce nu mi se pare normal. Consider ca neputând accesa serviciile si fără acces la conținutul digital ""oferit"" sunt eligibil de refund si chiar vreau banii inapoi. Edit la sugestia dezvoltatorului : Link-ul sugerat nu are absolut nici o relevanță pentru problema cu care ma confrunt!!! | stopped working too many times Christmas day | Worst is impossible. We can't watch on the tv because you don't have the application for Samsung tv, and on the telephone the streaming is so poor we can't view a single film . I'm sorry I payed you a month. | This app/service is really bad! Not supported on PS not supported on Samsung tv's app stores, doesn't work from the tv browser and cannot stream from phone to tv. In a nutshell you can use it on your phone or laptop only. Save yourself some time and avoid creating an account and paying for a service that you can't use. Absolute no customer support from their end. | no proper surround soundand the worst part is it's still lagging | It is the only app out streaming platforms. (Hbo, netflix, disney+) that is continuously playing if you fall asleep, for example, and drains all your battery. Do something about this? It's stupid and a waste of resources. | clean and quick | By far the worst streaming app. It is painful to use it. | Android TV user (Philips). Occasional stutters of video playback are just not acceptable. Other streaming apps (Netflix, HBO Max) work fine. | Unlike many other apps, this one works | buggy | cannot open the app for 3 days now, keeps crashing and reloading. ugh | It's Good | i have the same issue..., can't use it in landscape mode, and can't resize it on chrome os. | Still no 4K. Downloads expire so fast I can't even download something before a short trip and be able to watch it when I'm coming back. Worst VOD in Poland :( | Limited content in the Netherlands. Some really nice films but dreadful streaming quality in the evening (_not_ an issue with _my_ network). Resorted to downloading to workaround it. | Good movies and shows. Amazing price. It could have more programs for kids. | very poor aop conpared w Netflix. even HBO is (a bi) better | can't disable the subtitles on mobile. I click disable, it goes back to english. on the desktop, the quality is not even close to high quality 1080p. I'm watching on MacOS with Safari, on the latest MacBook pro, I should get at least 1440p, the quality is terrible! | This is a garbage app, you download movies so You can watch them online, for some reason they expire and when you want to watch them because you have no internet, you can't because they are expired. | nu are dublare în limba romana la filmele pentru copii | Doesn't run real full screen, on the camera side theres a huge black bar unlike on the Iphone where it's actually full screen. | This piece can change system language anything but English | App doesn't work anymore. It says that I'm offline even though I'm not. All other streaming platforms work fine. | muy bueno. | keep up the good work | UI is ugly and terrible to navigate | Amazing 👑💎♥️🇺🇸 | 1.13.0 - another update that doesn't change or fix anything. SkyShowtime & Peacock app developers, what are you doing all these months? // 8 months after launch (1 year in other countries) they still didn't fix the subtitles customization and display problem. Shame. | Update: downgraded from 2 stars to one, officially worst streaming app(not working for now) Good content poor app On Phillips android tv i can barely watch something it frezzes every 3 seconds, update urgently needed | Subtitles essentially do not work... EDITED over a year later... Removed rest of that. Finally now most subtitle related things actually work. That's something any single decent programmer would have done in a week. But they are really not interested in the non-USA users, but still they finally got it working in a near decent manner. Raising 1 to 3 stars | can't play video on android projector | Do not subscribe, you'll die trying to find how to unsubscribe their mediocre service. | Hangs on my Nest Max. Works on my Chromecast | I started watching Halo. I use Xiaomi Mi Box S to stream media on my TV. The issue is that the SkyShowtime app is crashing again and again when you push the play button. Even if I cast from my smartphone app to smart TV, I get this error ""Ooups, we have encounted a problem"", We also use Netflix,AmazonPrime,Disney+,HBO Max, which are working perfectly fine on the same Xiaomi Mi Bos S. Of course, we will cancel the monthly subscription as SkyShowtine servers and application are not well defined. | Not the best selection of movies and series. Ugly subtitles that hide the picture. I only got the subscription for the Star Trek series. | Just really bad 'streaming', more like dripping. Mobile app is slow, controls are bad, and cannot maintain a smooth HD video going for more than 5 seconds. Initially thought these were startup issues, but after months there is no improvement and clear signs of deterioration. The web-based version is not much better, with most movies not loading, or if they do run, restarting at random intervals. Only good performance when you first download the video file, undermining the whole 'streaming' thing | Your subtitle format is horrible and offers no way of changing it. The trailer feature is also horrbile and offers no way of changing it. I'd expect these things in 2013, not 2023. | SkyShowTime has not been working under Google TV for days. | App does not work in Redmi note 12 | When you start to cast an episode that is partly watched, it always starts from the beginning, and forgets where you were. Subtitles sometimes just disappear as well. Can this please be fixed? | not sure why the app would need to have permission to access my location. | A billion dollar company doesn't have an app on PS5, so I have to watch the app on my pc or phone. Also several Paramount+ shows are missing, such as South Park. Good selection of new movies. No anime or adult cartoons. | Ide írom, mert máshol semmilyen információt nem közölnek. Néhány napja GoogleTV-n az egyik pillanatról a másikra, összeomlott az applikáció. Azóta már el sem indul. | Chromecast user, new born problems and only stereo sound on Dolby 5.1. Not enough for home cinema set. Update required. Please stop auto play next episode on Chromecast, reason to quit. | works ok | Can't play most movies and shows on Google TV HD. Very bad. | worst app ever. | It does not work. Suddenly it stopped to work on my phone and on my TV box (as the error message says, it is not working in my country, which is not correct, I am in Hungary). Please fix it or I will a cancel it immediately. | Como usuario de varias plataformas de streaming la pondría un 4 sobre 10.Una aplicación de streaming sin apenas errores y mejor que otras como HBO. EL PROBLEMA viene con el contenido tiene un repertorio de series y películas escaso te venden Skysowtime como la fusión perfecta de 6 productoras TOP pero la realidad es que cada una de ellas aporta 20 películas ""contadas"" a la plataforma tiene menos contenido que Prime Video que ya es decir . | Would like to have Greek subtitles also. | No autoplay when Chromecasting. | The app does not even open. | Cool and smart selection of movies. My favourite, by far. Thank you for all the good time 🙂 | downloaded episodes expire way too fast and there is no warning about it | 2023, no 4k streaming? | Android TV user here! I use phillips android TV and other streaming platforms work perfect on it, never a single lagg or quality drop I swear to God! Now I have huge issues with SkyShowtime: 1. Whatever I am watching it is lagging constantly stoping for split second. 2. Whenever I start watching something, it starts with very low quality and builds up to high quality. 3. Subtitles wont turn off and they look just hideous YALL NEED TO IMOROVE IT IM PAYING FOR IT AND ITS WORLD CRYSIS!!! TY | What happened to ""continue watching"" ? I'm streaming something, close that app and then I have to search for that movie all over again. Subtitles are working only when they want. Streaming over 4g is a struggle. Tv app is very laggy and takes forever to load. Great service poor app. Keep on improving it! | The currently watching episodes no longer appear on a section in home page. I must enter ""My Stuff"" and open the show and resume the episode. | No ""Continue watching"" anymore. Bring it back! | Lots of good shows. Unfortunately the streaming is constantly pausing for a second. None of my other streaming services do this, and it's VERY irritating | The content is ok and is getting better but the app is just plain bad. 3 major headaches for me - autorewind is just terrible; can't login with qr code - you have to enter the password manually which is pretty hard on most remotes; the subtitles don't have an outline making them hard to read on light backgrounds. | 0*: It was nice at start, now does not work on my Xiaomi MI Led TV 4S 55 4k. It says not available in my region. It cannot be the rootcause of the problem because it has been working for the past few months. Please do something because that's not what I subscribed to. Do you need my money??? Fix the problem | Doesn't work on Lenovo tablet. | Crashes contantly | Far better than HBO, 60% cheaper on top of that!!! | ""Continue watching"" section disappeared on all platforms more than a week ago, and still not fixed. Hard to believe this was done on purpose—if so, a truly stupid decision—as it makes it so annoying to watch series or to resume a movie without this feature. Also hard to believe that such removal remained unnoticed during the release process. So please fix this quickly if you don't want to infuriate some of your user base any longer. | It does play video, but that is the only good thing. It did not allow to change playback speed, it can't be minimized, it can't play video in a pop-up window. Searching is poor. Can't change video quality preferences. Overall very poor user experience. Latest update made it even worse. ""Continue watching"" section is gone. | Unnistaled today after receiving an email today that my subscription was canceled because the app didnt manage to verify my biling payment,i mention that i had the 2 euros monthly for lifetime payment for over one year now.canceled by skyshowtime and now i have to pay the 4 euros plan.no thanks.verry disapointed | Subtitles need GPS. I would be embarrassed if I made this. The App is decent, but no Netflix. Having the Showtime content available is great. One of my favourite production houses. They fixed the horrendous issues with the subtitles, finally, but now the ""continue watching"" disappeared. I scroll and I scroll, it is nowhere to be found. @Showtime: when you fix this, don't be Netflix and make the location dynamic - it should always be the first row! | Freaking app! I pay, so I want to download in the best video quality! I CANNOT FIND THE PROPER SETTINGS! WHERE CAN I CHANGE THE DOWNLOAD QUALITY OPTIONS??? | Better than NeTFLiX | Love this app but put back ""continue watching"" for the fifth star! 😀 | many streaming glitches | bad streaming quality | Canceled subscription a day before renewal, and was charged for it the same day Why do you charge a day ahead of the renewal date, and the subscription was cancelled! Awful! | not able to see the number of episodes of e.g. Rabbit Hole Subtitle selection is also strange | It is stated that there is Dolby 5.1 content. Maybe this is the case but streaming via Chromecast gen2 there is no Dolby 5.1 on any content. I get Dolby 5.1 on HBO Max without any problem. I have reported this to support team in December 2022 but so far no success. Reply to SkyShowtime response: My setup supports Dolby 5.1, on every other platform I can enjoy Dolby 5.1, just not on SkyShowtime. I think that the problem is that you haven't tested properly on Chromecast Ultra 4k (this is gen2) | Don't get this if you're in the NL looking for Paramount+ content like StarTrek Lower Decks. They don't have it. (Seasons 1 & 2 are on Prime; the rest, who knows?) | Nie działa Chromecast. Apka zawiesza się. Nie da się nic oglądać! | The app is not working since yesterday, keep opens and black screen is shown. | excellent 👍 | Frasier! | There are a lot of shows not having all seasons. Why bother include them, when you know you will never add rest of seasons? I gave the service a try because of some movies and now I noticed most of them are gone without any official heads-up. Most probably I will soon terminate the subscription... | Great app | Needs an option to disable autoplay, it starts some random movie which stays in your continue watching forever. And I really don't like it doesn't play movie credits to the end. Also should have an option to not autoplay trailers. | Thank you very much for you quality library of timeless masterpieces, both movies and TV shows. | One of the best!","{""1"":4883,""2"":3022,""3"":5115,""4"":10021,""5"":40343}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK 179.00 - CZK 1,429.00 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","SkyShowtime","7044461797746424693","help@skyshowtime.com","https://www.skyshowtime.com","NDSM-plein 6

Had replied inmediately to your email with a screen shot of my Google Play subscription for Eset. It is valid until Aug 24. Its been a few months that I am not being able to get the full value of my subscription. Time marches on inexorably. Before we know it ; we will be in Aug. Hope you help resolve this. Have a great day. Cheers Tushar | ESET MSP is fairly well security for your Smartphone. Scan, protect, intercept dangerous internet software or malicious links. | I have used it in the past and AV-Coparatives ran tests and ESET came out on top. | This application was so very helpful to me because it can monitored in any vulnerable issues | Peace of mind in respect of malware protection ! & Informed regularly for update ! | Whats is problem with this app. Its is showing error ""communication error"" everytime I try to allow entries | Good and number 1 | Excellent coverage. Need more be said? | Best anti-virus available! | 👍 | Excellent app 100% | The best for security protection at all times. | Great software | Goodbye to fraud scams and gamble. | Hi why I can't update modules error everytime I try the app has potential it works well except for this problem plz fix | Easy to use and good protection too | Best antivirus while has a huge gap for improvement. | It works well | I have been using ESET since 03/21, (3 years now) and it hasn't let me down yet! | Trust is in this app. Mobile and PC, original review on November 19, 2017, and still 5 stars ⭐ today March 2024 and again still the best protection updated to paid annual subscription of $15.00 a year , I trust that much , not any other company does what ESET DOES, AND GREAT PROTECTION FOR FREE, AWESOME ANNUAL PLAN 👍💱🏁 | A very systematic approach to keeping the mobile phone safe from attacks. | I use this eset for my pc and android | 🙂👍 | Can I cancel my subscription today do I get refund,? | A very good anti virus and has a lot of features and is easy to use. | The best.. | Best kept secret, I use on all of my Android devices! The UI is contemporary and still cohesive, the options in the Basic app: very useful; thanks ESET!! | Best Protection for Stars | So far, it's been a straightforward app. I runs light on the phone's resources. | Bad | Love Eset security. It's one of the few security apps that offers it's own lost device feature rather than Google find my phone. | Love it's awesome! | Zatím funguje dobře | Good protection | We have ESET on all our machines | Great app | Simply the best. | Excellent experience | Good keep it up... | Good | I feel safer | Poderia atualizar automaticamente, sem perguntar/avisar. E o valor ao invés de ser anual, deveria ser vitalicio, ao menos para os usuários atuais, para evitar que migrem para outro novo app que surigira. | PLEASE PROVIDE VPN SERVICES FOR MOBILE DEVICES. | You are the best Eset moble app | super | Clear and concise, delivering a solid securitas. | I love you | Absolutely gobsmacked at the reliability. 100% the best security program that I have used over the past twenty years. On first scan it detected, quarantined and removed 7 trojans that another supposed ""best"" programs overlooked. I have my laptop, phones, tablet and my daughters laptop with Eset. My daughter has cerebral palsy and can easily operate Eset on her laptop giving me security in knowing she and her data is protected. Thanks Eset you rock! | Excellent value. | Opravte si poslednú aktualizáciu, za 3 hodiny mi aplikácia zožrala celú baterku. Pritom bežala iba na pozadí bez žiadnej aktivity | My old friend is back! I used ESET on my PC back in early 2000s. I loved how ""lite"" it was: simple (core functions only), effective and low CPU usage. Now I expect the same. | More confident knowing my mobile phone is covered by eset. My computer has had nod32 for decades. | Best app i have ever come upon. | Good app keep it up | why removed monthly subscription? | My experience with ESET has been good enough that I just renewed my subscription for another year. However, I remain unclear as to why it needs my location to check Wifi networks? It seems to me that it should just be able to scan any network in my proximity to see if it's safe, and I don't understand why my location is necessary for that. My ongoing policy is that no app gets my location for any reason as that's a privacy issue. | There is no wayto tell the app that I am OK to data roam and phone roam, so I keep getting obsessivly notified that I am roaming and I might incur extra charges. Not true, I have practically gratis roaming, but keep getting annoying notifications. ESET responds that to stop notifications I must disable roaming. I am not kidding. This app is NOT USABLE WHEN ROAMING. You must keep it in your hand and check 100s of useless notifications.. I will switch to another product. | Great protection, I'm satisfied | Never had a problem with ESET - picks up anything that's amiss! | Excellent and does not drain battery at all, fast virus detection, I recommend. | Works well with my S24 Ultra 😎 | Good.The app is extremely wonderful....My phone is fully protected now. | The antivirus is user friendly,fast & uptodate... | Great security app | I think playing slots,Candy Crush, & Poker as well as life like games are , very fun as challenging... | Very good. For users that protection for popular internet browsers is not working just reboot your mobile phone and will work. | I have had your company as my mobile security system for many years now. To my knowledge, my devices have not been hacked. I can't say the same for my laptops, for which I use a different security system. I believe that ESET had just discovered and quarantined a virus once in the past week and then notified me about it. It proved to me that I am receiving great security in real time. I recommend you to everyone I know. | Great app | Safe and reliable protection. | The best | Digitally magnifiscent | Very secure! | El mejor antivirus, me elimino un troyano que ninguna aplicación fue capaz | Not not | Good | The app is great but when I try to open a Samsung app folder it just bugs it out and it won't show the apps | Es ist EIN AUSGEZEICHNETES Antivirenprogramm, ich habe es auf allen meinen Geräten installiert. | Thus far has done everything they say. No real slowing of my tablet and no lockups or freezing. Run on Samsung A9+ - Android | Good | One of the best security and antivirus software available.

Chybí mi tmavý režim aplikace. | Just missing the urgent highlight | Jako appka dobra, ale nelibi se mi jak me ted porad odhlasuje a porad chce dalsi informace, uz je z toho malem osmifaktorove zabezpeceni a jdete s tim uz do haje. Fakt. | Hrozne, posledni dobou se nenacitaji vubec emaily nebo obrazky v emailu. Stahovani priloh take pokulhava. Gmail funguje normalne a svizne, email.cz je jak zelva proti nemu. Kde je problem prosim? LGV30 Android 9 | Neupozorňuje na nové emaily. | Mate tam nejakou botu. Do aplikace se jiz nelze prihlasit, protoze po zadani emailu vyskoci obrazovka ktera by chtela overit telefoni cislo. Ovsem je tak glitchy ze se tento krok neda ani splnit ani preskocit. Porad blika a refreshuje se. I kdyz tento krok funguje, vyskoci dalsi obrazovka ktera chce overovat bankovni ucet - tento krok je nepreskocitelny prestoze napoveda tvrdi ze toto overeni mit nemusim pokud nechci. !Kazdopadne momentalne je aplikace doslova nepouzivatelna! | I already compressed video to 21mb but email says cant be sent. 5.0.0 smtp; 552 5.3.4 Message size exceeds fixed limit Permanent Failure - Other or Undefined Status Why? the size is smaller then 25mb and even before sending it says i can attached number of MB what left. you can send with email.cz up to 50 MB video so what is correct and why is not working?! | Stejný problém jako na apce seznam.cz. Používal jsem rozepsany email pro rychlý přesun souborů mezi PC a mobilem. Bohužel teď v rozepsanych emailech chybí možnost soubor stáhnout. Jedina možnost je soubor odebrat. | The app doesn't synchronize | Aplikace přestala zobrazovat obsah zpráv, po reinstalaci se už ani nenačetla schránka. | V aktuální verzi nejde zobrazit odeslanou poštu, prosím o opravu. | Debilní aplikace, zradí zrovna, když ji potřebujete nejvíce. Přechod na Google e-mail nevyhnutelný. | Unstable, sometimes not working, cannot decrease size of the attached images and much more. | It' better than to open mails from browser on mobile but that's basically it - one ⭐. It's not possible to archive an email by swipe action. I have marked already several emails as spams by mistake instead of archiving them because these two options are next to each other in the menu. I would really appreciate at least a separate icon. The dark mode is useless. And that's basically the only thing that can be customized. One additional ⭐ for search that works well. | Velká spousta bugů. Ale co opravdu dělá aplikaci v podstatě nepoužitelnou je nespolehlivost oznamování nových zpráv. Severity 1: Nefunguje stahovani priloh. | Na pocophone běží velmi pomalu, zasekává se. | Everyday usefully | Někdy trochu problém s načítáním zpráv, ale jinak fajn appka. Bohužel se nezobrazuje ve vyhledávání na Google Play, to je škoda. Už dvakrát za krátkou dobu jsem ji instaloval a musel jsem ji hledat mimo Google play 27.11.21 - Po poslední aktualizaci zamrzá dotek v rámci aplikace. Někdy nejde začít psát zprávu, někdy nejde zprávu odeslat. | Po poslední aktualizaci se není možné odhlásit....🙄 | Dobrá a jednoduchá aplikace | Aplikace si po aktualizací nepamatuje moje přihlašovací údaje a musím se stále dokola přihlašovat. | After reinstall the app works as usual. | Sometimes when I receive a reply from someone the text they send doesn't show up, its really annoying ans I have to tell them to message me on gmail. When sending a reply there is like 10% chance that the email will just not send and you have to write it again. Deleted emails will randomly apper in your inbox, already seen emails will be randomly marked as unread, it's just a big mess. Oh and if you think you will always get notified about new emails then you can throw that out of the window. | Simple and clear | Těžce průměrná aplikace s řadou nedostatků. Když odpovídám na email, často mi zmizí předchozí konverzace a zůstane jen odeslána zpráva bez kontextu, což mně osobně vyloženě vadí. Tmavý režim je nepoužitelný, protože text příchozích emailů zůstává v původní barvě a tedy je téměř vždy nečitelný. Aplikaci používám vlastně jen když nemám u sebe notebook. | smrdi to | Splňuje základní požadavky. Je malý, svižný, podporuje více účtů, avšak ne současně. Při správném nastavení optimalizace / šetřícího režimu v systému notifikace fungují. Bohužel, stejně nepoužitelný tmavý režim jako ve webovém rozhraní (testoval to vůbec někdo z vývojářů?). Černý text na tmavě šedém pozadí v e-mailovém vláknu nebo v případě, kdy má odesílatel aktivní styly, není čitelný. Menším nedostatkem je nemožnost upravovat obsah původního nebo přeposlaného mailu (při odpovědi/přeposlání). | Mailovy klient funguje ok, ale vadí mi nemožnost vypnout notifikace jen u vybraných schránek pokud jich máte více.. | Terrible, unreliable, unsafe. My inbox is suddenly unable to refresh and since then I can no longer use the adress to recieve or send emails and as I had only saved the password within the app, I've simolteniously lost my gaming account which was connected to the adress used within this app. And technical support couldnt help me retrieve any data in the end. Absolutely terrible, would not recommend. | 1) Skoda že nemá akce na notifikaci např smazat email. 2) když si email otevřu notifikace nezmizí, musím ji pokaždé ručně odstranit | Neštěstí. Pridavani foto většinou nefunguje, casto neodesle email, zprava,kterou tak povazuji za odeslanou budto skonci v ""rozepsanych"" nebo, hure, zmizi uplne! | Doesn't show new emails | Není vidět černý text na bílém pozadí v tmavém vzhledu aplikace, musím používat světlý/výchozí režim vzhledu | Unfortunately, new emails didn't appear to me in the app. I have to sign in every time i wanna see new emails. :(( | Pretty poor... A huge deal breaker for me is that it only notifies you of emails if you just recently used your phone, if it sleeps for more than like 10 to 30 minutes the app just wont notify you no matter what settings of app or phone you, or at least I tried, it just doesnt work in a way instant messengers do so if you feel this email notifications would be a great thing to have, you very well might not receive many of those | Priserne pomala aplikace, nechapu proc nepodporuje @media query. Odflakla prace. 2 hvezdy za design. | Skvele!!! Chybi telo mailu, neotvira pdf, otevira jinou prilohu.... | Že by někdo zapomněl v tmavém modu aplikace zmenit cerny text data mailů při vyhledávání? :) + na Android 6 nefunguje český autocorrect a doplnovani hacku a carek, v predchozi verzi fungovalo (i kdyz mam android v anglictine). Zajimavostí je že v predmetu mailu funguje. Pády appky snad vyřešeny (Tab Prime 7, Android 6.0.1). | Works well | Good app been using it for 5 years now without any problem | Chybí mi jen funkce rychlého přepínání emailů co jsou ke mě propojené (na webu je to tak,že stačí kliknout na šipku v pravém rohu a je to tam) | Aplikace vůbec nefunguje, nelze vůbec přihlásit k email účtu | Absolutně nefunguje, nelze se přihlásit | Aplikaci bylo na některých tel. (třeba Xiaomi Redmi 6) potřeba přidat mezi chráněné, jinak usne a neupozorní na nový e-mail. Ale i kdyby jste to nenastavili, je ruční kontrola párkrát za den přes aplikaci o hodně pohodlnější, než se prokousávat na své účty jeden po druhém přes web... Co neumí? Zobrazit dva účty současně - musíte mezi nimi přepínat. Ale je to jediný e-mail klient, který mi jde i na wifi v práci. Do té doby to šlo jenom přes web, zaměstnavatel nám tyhle klienty nějak blokuje (doma mi fungují všechny). Fajn je, že vyhozený e-mail vyhodí i z účtu a souhlasí i složky ve schránce. | Vubec nefunguje synchronizace mailu od cca pulky ledna. Totalne nepouzitelna aplikace!! | Aplikace splňuje to, co od ní čekám: malá, přehledná, rychlá. Abych dal pět hvězdiček, jedna věc mě přeci jen chybí. Ve webové verzi vidím adresář osob, který mám doplněný o adresu, telefon a další informace. A tyto informace v appce postrádám. Plánujete je v Appce zpřístupnit? Nebo tma jsou a jen jsem je nenašel? Děkuji za případné info. | Pořádně se nenačítají zprávy. Notifikace nemizí po přečtení zpráv, musí se ručně zrušit. | I don't get notified when I get mail. | Nezobrazují se mi přílohy newsletterů. Problém přetrvává již měsíce. Nepomohlo ani znovu nainstalování aplikace. | Skvělá aplikace jednoduché čtení a psaní e-mailů :) oznámení | Absolute rubbish,only good for reading emails,you cannot write emails with a spotty connection or offline | Jméno odesilatele Při odesláni emailu z webu, příjemce vidí jméno odesilatele z nastaveni učtu. Při odesláni emailu z aplikace, příjemce vidí jako odesilatele jenom email !!! | Funguje v zasade hlavne online, takze proti webu neni moc výhod | Čas od času potize při stahování přílohy. 😕 šlo by s tim něco udělat? Nokia 5 android 9 | I am receiving notifications randomly. It's not reliable | Dobra na čtení emailu, ale ne na upozornění na email. Nezvládne běžet na pozadí jako jine email klienti, i kdyz vypnu optimalizace. Proto je pro mě nepoužitelná. | Po nové verzi lepší. | Redesign docela povedený, uvítal bych ale dark mode. | Nová verze je naprosto super)) líbí se jak to hezký zařazuje do spamu nepříjemné zprávy , a i se líbí ta oranžová ikonka | Nefunguje nahravani priloh, hlaseni prichozich emailu s hodinovym zpožděním. nedoporucuji | Was an awesome app I've been using for years, however since autumn it has very annoying bugs, making the app not-properly syncing, not showing new emails, and also sometimes e-mails completely stuck in the concepts instead sending. I am sad to say that app is completely useless in this state. Reinstall helped, however two weeks later the same problem. Already noticed Seznam about this bug 3 months ago, but they don't care at all. Time to swtich for good. RIP Email.cz :( | Naprosto nespolehlivé odesílání e-mailů. Poslední 2 měsíce se nepodařilo ani po opakovaných pokusech odeslat jediný e-mail... E-maily nejsou odeslány, aniž by se objevilo jakékoliv chybové hlášení. Takže vlastně ani netušíte, že něco selhalo. Přijdete na to, až Vás někdo urguje a vy e-maily nemůžete najít v složce odeslané. Navíc e-mail nezůstane ani ve složce rozepsané, takže jej musíte psát celý znovu... | The app does not work at all. There is a sentence that reads that something went wrong. | Bohužel jsem po několika letech aplikaci musel odinstalovat, velmi rád se k ni vrátím, až v ohledu odesílání e-mailů nebude problém. Nyní jsem kazdy e-mail musel kontrolovat, jestli ho aplikace zvládla odeslat nebo ne a jakmile člověk jednou zapomněl, zjistil pak po několika dnech, že důležitý e-mail po odeslání zůstal v rozepsaných. Jinak žádná vada, akorát bych ocenil možnost vyhledávání mezi e-maily, jako v internetovém prohlížeči. Snad bude problém brzy odstraněn. | Většinou vůbec nevyskočí notifikace o nově příchozím emailu. :/ | Vypadalo to jako vyborna aplikace az do doby, nez jsem zjistil, ze odeslane maily neodesila. | Konečně pouzitelnejsi než dřív | Aplikace stale pada a znovu zobrazuje smazane maily | Pro oldschool loosery, co se nechtějí pokaždé přihlašovat přes seznam je to krok vpřed, ale v porovnání s gmail aplikací je tahle aplikace pořád 100 let za opicema jako samotnej seznam, kterej se divím že ještě nezkrachoval. Nechodí vám upozornění na nové e-maily, ani když aplikaci otevřete, nevidíte nové maily. Musíte swipe down aby se asi za minutu načetla všechna nepřečtená pošta, kterou by jinak aplikace sama o sobě neukázala. Takže třeba dostanu mail zavolejte mi, ale všimnu si toho v 10 večer, protože ta aplikace mi to sama neřekne, musím se jí zeptat, nemám náhodou nějaké nové maily? Prostě rubbish. Kromě toho chybí spousta funkcí, které v PC zobrazení jsou jako například přidat kontakt do adresáře, označit mail barevně, vytvořit novou složku. Když už máte email založený na seznamu, špatně komunikuje s gmailem. Odpad | Total garbage. Reading emails with colored text seems like raw code. Can't recommend. Unusable last days, application defects from earlier versions still persists... | Celkem fajn aplikace až na pár věcí které nejsou moc pohodlné. Když jsem ve složce odeslané bylo by fajn aby to bylo lépe vidět. Jakmile začnu scrollovat název složky mizí nahoře a už nevím kde jsem + by nápis mohl být výraznější. Ještě by bylo fajn kdyby se odpověď na email zobrazila hned v mailu který přišel ne že musím chodit do odeslané a tak je teprve vidět. Diky | I'm using the app. for some time... and it's more or less ok... but last days it becomes unusable. I can read the incoming e-mails but the app. is not able to sync the content with the server, responses are not being sent... something is terribly wrong :-( | It doesn't send my emails. | Absolútne nespoľahlivosť.Nikdy neviete čo po ďalšom update prestane fungovať. Najzákernejšia je náhodná nefunkčnosť notifikácie príchodzej pošty, ktorá má potenciál spôsobiť veľké průsery, za ktoré, samozrejme seznam zodpovednosť neponesie a preto odporúčam neriskovať s touto ""aplikáciou"". | Po poslední aktualizace nehledá zprávy, nezobrazuje obsah zpráv a neaktualizuje se vůbec | Neni moznost hledani v mejlech. Neni moznost kopirovat text. Nic nefunguje spravne. Pouzivejte gmail. | Často se nezobrazuje začátek příchozí zprávy, což vidím jako obrovské mínus. Edit 1: opraveno | Casto nelze nacist nove zpravy, obcas prijde notifikace z emailu, ktery 
prisel pred mesicem a aktualne mi nejde spojeni vubec. Aplikaci jsem 
odinstaloval. | After last update, problem with content of mails has been resolved but now 
the app is crashing very often | Nedaji se vůbec číst nove maily, text je pokaždé schovaný pod hlavičkou 
mailu, takže aplikace je naprosto k ničemu. | Vůbec nechodí notifikace, musím si aplikaci na mobilu otevřít. Pokud se to nezmění, přestanu email na Seznamu využívat úplně. Je zde mnoho takových zpráv a vývojáři je buď nečtou nebo na to kašlou! | I přes update na nejnovější verzi se část zprávy stále schovává pod 
hlavičku, což znemožňuje čtení.. opravte prosim nebo si uz vazne necham 
preposilat poštu na gmail.. | Nefunguje jak má, neukazuje žádný nový email a když jo tak jich spoustu 
vynechá.. | Nezobrazuje celé emaily ani nepřichází upozornění na nové | Po poslednim updatu nejde videt telo emailu, zakryva ho hlavicka. | Dobry den, pouzivam Vasi aplikaci jiz delsi dobu (Note 3, Android 5.0) 
Aplikace zdlouhave odesila emaily, pak necha kopii v nedoslanych. Proto 
vzdy musim overovat, zda k odeslani doslo a manualne emaily z neodeslanych 
mazat. Kdyz otevru nove prichozi email, text je prohazeny, slova jsou 
prokladany nad sebou. Tedy neni to vubec citelne. Nebo se mi ukaze jen cast 
textu. Abych si prohledl prilohu, vzdy si ji musim stahnout. Zkusil jsem 
alternativni apky na Vas email, ty funguji. Ale mam email u Vas a popravde 
mi je proti srsti posilat emaily z gmail aplikace. Ma to reseni? Nebo se 
situace v nejblizsich dnech nevyresi? | Vrchní část zprávy se stále schovává pod lištu :)","{""1"":1091,""2"":328,""3"":1091,""4"":4901,""5"":27871}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Seznam.cz, a.s.","8961380020761803090","aplikace@firma.seznam.cz","https://aplikace.seznam.cz/","Radlická 3294/10, 15000, Praha 5","https://o.seznam.cz/ochrana-udaju/","8961380020761803090","Communication","COMMUNICATION","[{""name"":""Communication"",""id"":""COMMUNICATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wqj6gD8UVIwxd7_CRGAJmYvQflIfnpNw_aE4wRZaqth1SKY2EyALwuyWnm_BNSJqumo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xrbBHmeyGownto-CdLK921UiHVaC74PA7sqFexxoMfCzRfVHA1K8zxHJGR3Ot7nLCgg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Gw5Rv9THEj6hSkESspI0xJkxOmr8Y-_4GKNDM_0sU1Hj8-3uIbTqboRre0cAE5EMurle"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9Z4eE1zTp2QdO78AP_xHEOYNzGmgkyeq-8zOdxRgDiKoTJOYsKh2F7L79qpk2JA_857K"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lmfj_dQfxSQseFgtgldVjrvvBfeBxXv9t4pM04XZOQ2SAQjwt91AuUBjLkpk1zYxfbM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ssBSGZb0YGhfA3kF91xAYEvnA3doN9zNZlCnVdhWMN07D4-KLZKI1wCgYV6j0GYtvw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V8PAKEoijxJ7wCqhNscvGi0k-sZaPwEsmb87FMcZadm92WDXKzIZlrUwasRHEZP8""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 28, 2014",1710743783000,"2.4.57","• Možnost nastavení tmavého vzhledu aplikace dle nastavení systému<br>• Podpora sdílených schránek<br>• Tématická ikonka aplikace<br>• Opravy chyb a drobná vylepšení","[""It' better than to open mails from browser on mobile but that's basically it - one ⭐.

I tried to explain that religion isn't real but gpt can't learn facts. | pretty helpful | This IMHO is the best AI app out there. Why? Because it backs up it's results with full on links to websites. Most AI clients don't share resources but Copilot does. It's incredibly straight forward & easy to use. It comes in very handy for discussions on social media. No complaints at all & a joy to use 😀 | It's smaller than edge in size, but my phone heats up whenever I use this app | Excellent app | Bad.

It can cite academic sources and cross-check its own information. However, I personally have a Samsung Galaxy A52 with 6 GB of RAM, and it has serious trouble running this app. It takes every ounce of computing power my phone has to generate images and responses. The image generation is incredibly unstable and will often freeze or crash (by often, I mean once every 3-4 generations.) Needs to be more lightweight and stable, but a good tool nonetheless. | Thank you Microsoft 🙏🏼 | fabulous! | wow | i have been using Googles GEMINI which is also good but comparing every response given by Gemini and Copilot I find Copilot better | try it now | Copilot is pure brilliance. | Lots of fun so far. I've had it summarizing classic books I've always heard about but knew I'd never read. Update: It keeps telling me I've been disconnected and offers a dead link to reconnect. I'm not sure how to fix it. I've uninstalled and restarted over and over. I am frustrated but also understanding that it's new tech. | Just keeps telling me I lost connection over and over.

Super weird I think I am going to search for a better product | Just started getting a ""connection lost"" error code. Un-installed, cleared cache, checked permissions...nothing works. | good experience | I learned more through this app ,it's helpful. | good | Excellent app. It helps a lot with Bible study and (so far) gives answers to theological questions from a traditional and fairly conservative Christian point of view. This is the kind of AI we need - one that doesn't have built-in woke worldview biases to skew answers against Christianity. Good job on this one, Microsoft. Please don't ruin it! | Really good. | helpful | App keep saying..Sorry, but it looks like your connection has been lost. Would you like to try re-connecting? Connection is working fine though | awesome browser very technology gratifying. I'm wasn't a person who was into AI TECHNOLOGY, UNTIL . LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! Great job Microsoft! | I love it 💕💕💕💕💕 | Convenient while driving. | Does nothing it thinks I have no connection while the fiber optic 1000 mps network is blazing on. | it's awesome👍 👏 | Not working begining today. Cannot get connection. Dont know why. Updated app & restart phone. Same! No connection (reconnect but cant!). Useless microsoft gimmick. | Its the best and im so gratefull for rhe opportunity to have access to auch an amazing tool. i highly appriciate it | Worked well when I got it but as of lately all I get is ""Sorry it looks like your connection has been lost"". Tried with phone network and WiFi, tried clearing cache and force closing and nothing helps. | Not working after latest update | thek hai | - present as good assistance and much help. | it's very nice and I understand all | I have been using copilot for sometime now but unfortunately I don't know what's happening it's keeps freezing and saying my connection has been lost, that's why I rate it one it been hardly a month 😔😔 | For a test I asked it to plan a trip to okay a game that I play regularly. It did and listed three local clubs where I could play. Except I know all three clubs do not have facilities due that game. If I had relied on the apps results I'd be very disappointed. Now the app says my connection has been lost and I cannot reconnect, ever. It have me a totally wrong answer, once, and crashed forever | Brilliant, absolutely fantastic, it's gives you ideas in such detail, recommend this to all Microsoft users. Update: The app is not working, it keeps saying that it has no Internet connection even though WiFi and mobile data is on, please fix | uuuhhh when i open the app it works but if i try to ask it itt always says  Sorry, but it looks like your connection has been lost. Would you like to try re-connecting? even though i have internet i even tried cellular data to no avail.

I tried it all restarting my phone open and closing the app but the only way is to uninstall and install. | Doesnt work keeps saying im offline | Recomendo.... | good app | Very good app. highly recommended. you can use gpt 4 for free in this app. I have one suggestion can you add a edit option so if we send a text by mistake or forget to write few words we can then edit our text. this option is already in chat GPT.

Keep it up. | App isn't working after singing in | very very good application because I need it thank you | great experience | Cute | Excellent app | Most useful app for the students only one issues get response slow. | I love it when he is drawing | it is really your copilot while working on your daily task. | I love it keep it up thanks | If I have a question I ask COPILOT. I barely use Google anymore to get answers. 10 out 10 technology. Love the Dalle3 art generator aswell. | very helpful | completely useful | 5 stars for free gpt and updated information. I find myself using it more then Google and YouTube now.

"Sleep Monitor: Sleep Tracker","How did you sleep last night? 🌛

Sleep Monitor helps you track and record sleep cycle details. Sleep Monitor also has a smart alarm clock to remind you to sleep early at night and wake you up gently in the morning. In addition, Sleep Monitor provides relaxing sleep music to help you sleep better.  
 
Key Features:
 📊- New Feature: Sleep Trends
Improve sleep quality and develop better sleep habits with weekly and monthly data statistics.

🎙- Record Snoring or Dream Talking
Sleep Monitor will record snoring and grinding sounds made during your sleep, listen to them, and find more about your sleep the next morning! For fun!
 
💤- Mark Your Sleep Habits
If you drink, eat, exercise, have any pathological condition or depressed emotions before sleep, see how these slumber habits can impact your sleep.
 
📲- Track Your Sleep Phases
Sleepers will have 4 or 5 sleep cycles during the night. Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when most dreaming happens) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.
 
Sleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.
 
📈- Get Your Sleep Score
Sleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better. Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want a way to check how their sleep is, and do not want to invest in an accessory like a smart band or smartwatch.
 
⏰ - Set Smart Alarm Clock
Set an alarm for your morning wake-up or nap or set a reminder for bedtime.
 
🎵- Listen to Soothing Lullabies
Suffering from insomnia? Listen to high-quality relaxing music to calm a racing mind before sleep. Fall asleep quickly with different kinds of sleep sounds.

But you can listen to any of the recordings or look at and of the extra charts unless you pay | Interesting app | Works really good most of the time, however I noticed I had a really excellent sleep without no breaks and it didn't record the findings. It showed I only slept for an hour. This has happened a few times. | I can finally sleep | Tonight will be my first night. Looking forward to it after thoroughly going through your app. Amazing array of tools to fit anyone !! I'll update later! And thank you so much already! I've tried so very many things including a handheld electric device(!) meds, melatonin, sleep patches....I'm thinking this will be just what I need. TY! | Great app | Really good and they picked up the sounds of EVERYTHING even though I was far away from phone it is easy to use and highly recommend | Excellent records all sleep duration without crashing. | Fun to use☺️☺️☺️ | Good app | This is one of the best app ever Im a snoring person now its easy for me to get help I was in denial for a long time when people close to say I'm snoring badly and that I need to sick help | So insightful,amazing how much it shows. Love how it shows light sleep and deep sleep. Also it gives an overall sleep quality result. | perfect app | 5/5 give litsen for free tho | Awesome app | I love that I can finally figure out what's wrong with my sleep! | Nice app | I've been using the app for almost a year but now I'm not getting accurate reports. It tellme that I've been sleeping a significantly shorter time than actual. Example: says I slept 30 minutes when I know I was asleep at least 7 hrs. Very frustrating | ❤️ | access to absolutely nothing without paying. | They seem to have a very well established app lots of sound tracks and even stories along with sleep tracking and you can connect to google fit if you have one! | It's good works well | nice | Nice | Very nice 👍🤌 | Nice app and segments the sounds. You guys can give me the option to add more tags instead of selecting from the list you shared or choosing others. | Apparently there's a free plan but you can't get past the part where you have to select a yearly or monthly plan. | This is the best but not really I read the comments and it's kinds bad | Wasted app | Is so awesome | Good | Cringe and sus app. I didn't connect this to my Facebook but got notifications that I connected the app. | They want money for everything | Nice try should try for anlysis your sleep | Overall the interface and aesthetics are fantastic and the app records and categorizes your sleeping sounds excellently. However, the option to listen to recordings is locked behind the paid version of the app, which requires recurring billing. As the only real reliable functionality of the app is listening to your snoring behavior, the unlocked version would perhaps be worth a small payment, but as-is, this app is not worth the expensive recurring costs. | Great app for monitoring sleep, lots of info | Try it help u sleep better 👍 | Easy to use | Good | Good app | Good app | Ok | I need to sleep more so it really helps to know the stats and it's rewarding to know when I've slept more on a particular night I can work out what works best for me. | 🤭 | Best app for Android for free | Helped me sleep | this was actually a really good app. it helped me learn how to control my snoring, ect. definitely recommend | busy | I have used this app for only one night and am pleased with it. Easy to navigate but I wanted to show my kids but did not find the record/ results later in the day. | Great | Great app | The best app ever | Great app, I didn't know I did those things while sleeping , lol With all types os sounds to help you on your journey to dream. Monitoring numerous statistics, | Easy to use. | Excellent | I'm giving it a 1 because of the blatant misuse of female sexuality in the advertising. It looks like you're advertising a dating site or porn. Please change that! | Love the app.......Thanks So many perks | Tracks well give nice detailed sleep stats really love it | Love the app and I think it is a strong app to use if you want to record yourself snoring, talking in your sleep etc. | I really am happy I found this app. It tells you all about your REM sleep, shows you a graph, and records your sleep noises. And that's for free. For only two euros per month, you can find out your sleep apnea risks and snoring, different breathing exercises, more soundscapes, and much much more. Highly recommend. | Good | First time user, so not sure if working as yet. | Wow! | It is actually the perfect tracker for me....it tracks things way perfectly than I thought! Perfect!! | WARNING: THIS IS A VIRUS! DON'T INSTALL IT. | good analysis | very good | Easy to use and helpful sleep data! | This app thoroughly impressed me, beautiful, intuitive and they seem to have thought about every feature, well done team | Great app | Upon first use, I immediately hit a subscription barrier, with 80% of the app's features locked away. The app aggressively promotes discounts and offers a month's premium inexchange for a apositive review upfront, raising questions about the authenticity of its high ratings. It's hard to fairly assess the app when most features are inaccessible. A 7-day trial could offer a better initial experience, allowing users to fully explore the app before committing. | Excellent app, I love it. It changed my life, making me more cautious of my sleep habits and that I needed a cpap | Powerful sleeping app...wow, download this powerful app now | The ad said it's free, but then it is asking for a subscription fee once you download it | Very nice | Good | Best app ever | Helpful | Lots of information and reporting on the free version. Now I want to use the premium version. | Everything about this app is centered around a subscription they want you to pay. Without paying them you get nothing. | Yep | It's nice and helps me learn how I sleep at night. | I love it it helps me sleep even though I hate premium...I wanna hear myself sleep but can't... | Awesome | So good ! I to helps me so much! The music is so relaxing 😌 !! Good app!! RECOMEND!! | Looks ok but can't use it for it purpose until youmoay for a subscription | I hve already subscribed..still it is asking me to upgrade?? And my previous night sleep data is also gone.! The contact us section doesnt work either..wat kimd of scam is this. I need my sub money back or get this resolved asap. | 😒 | Nice | Okey so you take the money for one year, when you say there you subscribe one month what a fraud you make here, you didnt even ask if i wanted a year, you just show what cost in one month and in 1year The you tax me for the whole year FRAUD | JUST A MONEY GRABBING APP! Can't listen to any of your sounds throughout the night unless pay and subscribe! Very poor app! | Really good app but the main purpose I wanted to use this app was so I can listen to what I say during the night but I have got pay to do so on this app | Can't actually listen to any recordings without subscribing first. If you click on one star in app, no leave feedback button appears and it won't take you to google play. Looked so good too. But too sketchy for my liking | Best | it's nice and warm | Doesn't have any resemblance to what I actually am sleeping! Total waste of time and money. I would rate it in negative numbers if available. I'm trying to figure out how to cancel and get my money back!!! | Without EEG, eye and limb movement, oxygen saturation as well as a microphone for snoring, it is impossible to define patient sleep architecture. I emailed the developers asking for research comparing the app to the gold standard, polysomnography, but they did not respond with any. They did say they would add accelerometers but this is still insufficient. You can use the phone's recorder to listen for snoring. The app is not worth paying for. | Im not going to buy the premium to listen and buy the pro ver | I have just started using this app. So far, it is doing what it is supposed to. I will add more information as I go. | The best I've slept in years. Thank you | helpful | Downloaded app and wouldn't let me try it out for free. Automatically uninstaled. I won't pay for anything until I can get an idea of its worth to me.... | I love with all the features..wanna try for monthly subscription,but it's only provide yearly option..will use for free first | ❤️ | I love this a apps | Amazing app | you forces you to pay | Really helpful app nice interface | It's good but when ever I want to hear a noise what I did in night then we have to buy like what | Perfect | Great app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | I love it 😍😍💓 | Very nice | This app is so relaxed 😚❤🌠🌃 | This is an amazing tool to track your sleeping patterns. I've used it to make improvements in my eating/living/sleep rituals to see what improves my sleep, with real time results of what does and doesn't work. Everyone can benefit from using Sleep Monitor Sleep Tracker. | Useless and incorrect | Good | Brilliant app. | Advertised as free but it's not! Deceptive and untrustworthy!! | It's very good | Haven't been sleeping well lately and have had no luck finding an app that actually works, until this one! Now I know why I'm waking up exhausted! Thank you! | Pay | Delete fake | Good | Good | Nice app I can finally listen to myself | The best sleep I've ever had! | Some sort of gambling app? Showed a spinning wheel with prizes after loading it the first time. Uninstalled it after that, very confused | Expensive Excellent | Good | This really is a game changer, I've had trouble getting to and staying asleep for quite a while. I've tried other sleep monitoring apps but I'm not sure if it's the range of noises you can listen to or the clinical data you can read through after the event but it certainly helps lull you off to sleep highly recommended. | Great sleep app | This is not worth your data and download, it didn't even record anything, because it incountered trouble, but my phone says the app was in use the whole night, and then like everybody says it behind a paywall anyhow, I think it would be nice if there was something free not just immediately paying, for probably Ann app that doesn't work | it is just perfect,I totally love the app | Subscription based. I am so tired of all these apps having Subscriptions. I have enough Subscriptions. Don't need more. | 😍😍😍😍😍😍Excellent | Ilove it | It is a very good app | Looks like it's tracks the sleeping stats well. I like the break down. | Great 😃 , Sleep Moniter Is Excellent tool for Tracking & analysing My Sleep Pattern . | Good app for tracking your sleep, though you do have to pay premium for most things. It's quite a good app!! | Nice 😌 | I will say it's the one of the best application I ever download accent job whoever make this app Good job | lousy app | Good | واو | You have to pay to listen to any sounds dont waste your time | Have to purchase . Thought it's free | Fantastic and accurate App! I would highly recommend it to everyone. My elderly mother has trouble sleeping. I am now going to use the Sleep Monitor App, so we have an idea of how much/long she slept before going to see a doctor with the information Sleep Monitor App has provided. 5 STAR'S 🌟 ALL THE WAY. | No trial subscription, only paid one. And the subscription is damn costly. Uninstalled the app. | Wonderful app. Don't forget to re-install after Android or IOS updates. Especially when you notice that it stopped tracking / working. This is your cue to re-install. You probably had your phone updated by Samsung, Apple, Google, or whatever phone brand you own. | This app is just amazing! | Why does it tell me to connect charger while sleeping? What if I don't?! I mean I don't want to ruin my battery by charging all night! So please tell what's the reason for highlighting that charging part?? | Nice | Love this app. To be honest it really helped me w my sleep. | Easy to set up and lots of useful features | The best sleep monitor app in the all play store. It records accurately every single important data about you while sleeping and analyses the quality of your sleep too. A must have app. | I'm sleep soo fast | I absolutely love this app it records everything I bought it yearly andan it records everything I absolutely love it. Tracks my sleep when I'm awake my sounds even my husband snoring lol but seriously Iove this all. It keeps track with everything I will be paying again next year I love it alot. | Has really helped with my sleep | Me quedo impresionado, creo que intentaré pagar la suscripción para ver las demás características. | App constantly quits on it's own, not recording anything. If it decides to work the volume of any recorded sounds are so low that even with my phone at full volume it's impossible to hear it. I canceled my subscription and do not recommend this app!! | It does what it says, and very well at that! | Nice | This is only my 4th day using it, but every night has been inaccurate in its records. It says I take minutes to fall asleep, when it can take more than an hour. One night I was coughing and sneezing, and checking the time on my phone occasionally, yet it says I was asleep during all that, and didn't record any movement. Didn't even record my dogs barking all night one night. All customer support does to ""help"" is ask where I keep my phone. I put it on my nightstand, a foot or two from my head. | It is really good | Te ayuda demasiado en tu sueño | It's very good, it's helping my sleep sm | Great App!! | Excellent | It's good but it makes you pay for 90% of the app | This app sucks i tried the sleep tracker and only 2 weren't paid so deleting this app gor good | Nice | Good and helpful app | Very good app | Nice app | Good | Such a good app it recorded my sleep very well would recommend | Amazing, sleeping better | Positive | I love this app. No i know how my night goes | slightly more expensive but otherwise ok | Helps me sleep,playing relaxing and calming music. | It's a nice and soothing layout. The background noises are calming as well. Right now I am quite enjoying the help of the App. That said I am looking forward to a better sleep. | Very nice it really helped me reduce stress in when I wake up | it's accidentally taken my money. so I just use and it's good. | Love it | Awesome app tracked my sleep activity very efficiently | Good 1 | I actually sleep quite well, had no idea I talk in my sleep | It helps me sleep better | 😍😍😍😍😍î | Helped me improve my sleep | Please don't use... Thats it..... No more comments | Buen programa | This has really helped me sleep for the past couple of weeks | UPDATE: Subscription is now reflecting. Some links like Contact Us need rechecking though. Thanks Sleep Monitor team! UI is buggy. I bought a yearly subscription but it did not reflect in the app. Connecting to Google Fit is a two step procedure, while disconnect it is as easy as one tap. Quite suspicious.

"EPP – Pomáhej pohybem","With the EPP mobile application from the CEZ Group and the CEZ Foundation, you help with movement. Whether you run with your phone, ride a bike or go for walks, each activity means points for the project you choose, which the ČEZ Foundation will financially support.

The EPP - Help by Movement mobile application is a tool that allows the user to determine which projects and in what amount the ČEZ Foundation should financially support with their own active movement.
The application records the user's movement (eg walking, running, cycling, skiing, but also indoor activities such as treadmill running) and, in addition to common data on speed, time, pace or distance, also generates points. The user can dedicate them at any time to one of the currently offered projects of non-profit organizations, schools or municipalities. If the users of the application collect a certain number of points in a given time, the ČEZ Foundation will support the project with a specific amount known in advance. Current and already supported projects, including the status of points and target amounts, can be monitored at www.pomahejpohybem.cz or www.nadacecez.cz

The application can also work as a classic sporttracker. The application also generates personal performance statistics sorted by days, types of movement, etc. Downloading the application, its use, generating points is of course free, data application is required by the application only at launch or when the user wants to dedicate generated points to one of currently offered projects. The application is optimized for mobile phones with Apple iOS operating systems, from version 7, Android from version 4.0 and Wear OS 2.0. Use of the application is either anonymous or registered via e-mail or Facebook account.

Attention, after switching on, make sure that you have movement switched on in the exterior (points are generated according to the movement under GPS) or interior (points are generated according to the motion sensors in the mobile phone.)

Tohle nekdo šil hodně horkou jehlou a pak se na to vysr... | Po zapnuti apky a stisknuti tlacitka ,,bez registrace"" se apka zakousne. | Pri kliknuti na tlacitko na ""chci podporit"" obrazovka zbela a sekne se při ""načítání"" | Po půl roce na mobilu Xiaomi přestala fungovat, negenerují se žádné body, aspoň to appka píše. Sice appka má support, kam se dá napsal, tlačítko poslat dotaz, nicméně vůbec nikdo nereaguje. Takž podpora vůbec žádná. Asi si myslí, že si appku mám smazat a znovu naistalovat, ale to přijdu o celou historii, aspoň to appka píše. Sice zřízena za hezkým účelem, ale tím vše končí. Člověk, když sportuje, či často jezdí na kole, chce i pomoc, ale není mi bohužel přáno, skoro si říkám, jestli to u tak bohaté společnosti není i účel. No, na kvalitního programátora by mohla mít. Aspoň si to má maličkost myslí | Patrně po poslední aktualizaci mobilu (patrně někdy v září 2021) mi aplikace totálně nefunguje. Zapnu, dám do kapsy a konec. Přestane cokoliv počítat. Po odemknutí mobilu se zase chytne, ale pak to samé. Vlastně úplně nepoužitelné. (Nastavení mobilu jsem nijak neměnil, ani jsem změnu nenašel.) | Po mnoho měsíců bylo apka OK, ale asi tak během posledního měsíce apka vubec nemeri vzdálenost ani čas, prostě se jakoby zmrazi, když strcim telefon do kapsy. Drive to normalne merilo. Nevím, co s tím je, ale takto je zcela nepouzitelna ... too bad | Jsem s aplikací absolutně frustrovaná. Dopuručuju stáhnout cokoliv jen né tuhle pitomost. Nápad s body je dobrý, ale realizace je příšerná. S novým měsícem se mi vymazali všechny aktivity i s nasbíranými body, které jsem ještě nepřiřadila na projekt a nikde není historie aktivit. Dále je špatné, že je nutné mít telefon u sebe při všech aktivitách a to i u např. posilování a fotbalu. Spousty sportů tam ani nejsou. Jsem na aplikaci naštvaná a ihned mažu. | I love the idea and the app works perfect. Very neat. | Dobrý nápad, appka vcelku funguje i na starším stroji. Počty přidělených bodů jsou mi ale záhadou a i na nejčastěji opakované trase nekonzistentní. Počty bodů u podporovaných projektů také podivně kolísají, snad je chyba při komunikaci se serverem. Chybí mi možnost importu/exportu (z/do jiných aplikací nebo souboru, např. gpx, tcx, fit). Nechápu absenci indoor jízdy na kole - dle mého jde o široce rozšířenou a velmi snadno měřitelnou aktivitu. | Thak you | Great idea but so poorly implemented. The app is so buggy that it's really unusable. Is that on purpose to save ČEZ money? If not, they could grant some money to the app developer to make it work again. | Myšlenka super👍, ale ta aplikace je docela bídná (často se seká a trvá jí vždy tak půl roku, než se vzpamatuje). 😡 | Není příliš vhodné na aktivity na krátké vzdálenosti (například chůze dokola po místnosti mi nezapočítávala body, ale třeba je na vině horší GPS). Jinak zcela funkční, ale náročné na baterii. | Normalne na sledovani trasy pouzivam aplikaci od adidas, ale rekla jsem si, ze tady bych mohla podporit i dobrou vec, tak jsem si stahla i tuhle. Bohuzel, aplikace se mi vypinala behem cesty (jestli kvuli slabsimu signalu v urcitych mistech nebo nejake chybe primo v aplikaci netusim). V momente kdy jsem dle adidas nachodila bezmala 30km a na epp 4,5km, jsem aplikaci nastvane odinstalovala. | Apku jsem zacala pouzivat priblizne pred pul rokem po dobu tri mesicu a nebyl problem. Vzdalenosti odpovidaly, vsechno fungovalo. Ted jsem se k apce vratila a po trech tydnech mam sto chuti ji odinstalovat. Vzdalenosti jsou uplne mimo, ted mi po 7km behu EPP oznamilo vzdalenost 2,3km a pridelilo 20bodu. A vzhledem k nemoznosti synchronizace s jinymi sportovacimi apkami s tim clovek nehne. Myslenka je dobra a rada bych pokracovala v podporovani, ale pokud se situace nezlepsi, tak si to odpustim. | Myšlenka je to dobrá myslím si, že to pomáhá, ale najedu na kole třeba 15 kilometrů a změří se mi tam 3.7kilometrů třeba | výborná myšlenka s tragicky špatným provedením. zprvu aplikace fungovala dobře, ale nyní,z nejasného důvodu, padá a seká se. stává se, že čas od času něco hůř změří, což by se dalo odpustit, kdyby zbytek aplikace fungoval správně. přidělení bodů jednotlivým projektům je ale horor a vyžaduje použití té nejčernější magie vždy, když je měsíc v rudém úplňku a zakokrhá kohout přesně ve 2:23:45 ráno | Rád bych se touto cestou zeptal, zdali se neplánuje podpora fitness zařízení, např. společnosti Garmin aj., kde by se mohly aktivity do EPP přenášet a nebylo by třeba mobil při aktivitě nosit. Tuto funkcionalitu využívají i jiné fitness mobilní aplikace. | Nelze zresetovat heslo | Seká se, zpětně mění data, neměří. Odinstalovávám. | Pomalu se načítá, špatně měří vzdálenosti, a kdo ví, jestli to skutečně někomu pomáhá. Ale myšlenka je to dobrá. | Aplikace padá, nefunguje, nezaznamenává, dost se to zhoršilo. | Super. Jen mi chybí možnost propojení s měsícem tepu. Přidělování bodů se musí dělat vždy po jednotlivých trénincích. Víc by se mi líbilo body nasbírat a pak je najednou přidělit. Jelikož se projekty déle načítání trochu to zdržuje takto. | Nápad dobrý, provedení horší. Často měří špatně vzdálenost, takže okrádá o body. Seká se nebo je neskutečně pomalá. A vrchlol...dnes je nový měsíc a chtěl jsem k projektům přiřadit body vyběhané za minulý měsíc, který byl hodně plodný, a už mi to nabízí jen nový měsíc... prostě naběhaných 200 km je pryč. Tak tomu už říkám slušná krádež bodů, které mohli něco podpořit! Výsledek: místo podpory tato apka přispěla jen ke zvýšení tlaku. | Přiřazování bodů po jednotlivých aktivitách je opravdu otravné. Například pro chůzi už aplikaci vůbec nepoužívám, protože mi těch pár bodů nestojí za čas vynaložený na proklikávání se projekty | Váš support nereaguje, tak skúsim dotaz tu - ako je možné, že trasu, ktorá podľa mapy.cz má 60km, podľa inej appky 59, nameria EPP na 46km? To je 25% rozdiel, dosť slušná odchýlka. Pričom ešte v květnu to hlásilo na tej istej trati okolo 52km. Mimo to ma štve nemožnosť priradiť viac/všetky aktivity naraz na projekt, preklikávanie z prehľadu cez ""Priraď body"" nefunguje (resp. tam vôbec nie je - ide na detail aktivity, odkiaľ je potrebné ešte ďalšie dva prekliky na priradenie) | Nelze přidělit body z více aktivit zároveň, což je otravné naklikávat po jedné. (A výběr nenaplněných projektů bývá dost malý a tak se zdá, že si člověk nemůže skutečně vybrat co podpoří.) | Idea super, ale často se nechyti GPS, a jakmile je jen trochu nepřesný signál, aplikace nezaznamenava trasu. | Dobrý akorát mi nejde přiřadit body když jich mám víc jak 1000 když to zjistíte tak to dost nas..e | Helpful. For u and of course for people at project. ☺😊😊😊😊 | The  more often   I move, more I can  help | Myšlenka této aplikace se mi moc líbí, je super mít možnost podpořit svým pohybem projekty/nadace, které potřebují peníze. Aplikaci používám převážně při jízdě na kole a naštěstí nemám problém s vypínáním jak píšou ostatní. Bohužel mi ale nejde přepnout aktivity na indoor :-/ | Obcas sa zastavi a o kilometre a body pridete, co zamrzi. | Nápad se mi velice líbí, ale aplikace je téměř nepoužitelná. Pokud ji zapnu začne se má G2 šíleně přehřívat :-\. Chtělo by ji to ještě dopracovat ;-) | Kdykoli jdu behat a telefon se mi automaticky zamkne po chvili se mi aktivita zrusi.

I don't understand why it's required login at the start. In other app's this is not necessary (Corona-Warn, luca, etc.). | Aplikace mě po updatu odhlásila, tomu říkám kvalitní aplikace.. | Aplikace totality a fašismu, co víc si přát. | Never had a problem with the application. Make sure to update parameters 24h before use. | Certifikát načten přes QR kód a aplikace mi říká, že je neplatný. Platný rozhodně je,tak nevím kde je chyba. | Nestahuje posledni pcr test, u platneho pcr testu ukazovala stav neplatny, hlasi platne ockovani ale nezohlednuje covid pozitivitu | Červená? Update? | Easy to use and user friendly. Got 3rd shot and certificate appeared within 2 minutes in the app | Jsem jiz skoro 2 tydny pozitivni. Hygiena me podstive a mile dohledala (Diky!). Ale podle Tecky bych mohl radostne behat z hospody do hospody... | Would it be possible to add language switch EN/CZ option in the App. My phone is in EN language, but i want to have Tečka in CZ language. Thank you! Daniel | Při trochu větším fontu se k certifikátu vůbec nedostanu. Půl obrazovky zabírá žlutý blábol, druhou půlku jméno. | Mohly by se zde objevovat i absolvovane PCR testy, jak negativni, tak pozitivni. | Bohuzel pri pokusu o prihlaseni CSOB identitou to na strance CSOB rekne, ze nastala chyba a ani se nezobrazi login form. Chapu, ze je tam opravdu hodne moznosti prihlaseni a uhlidat, aby fungovaly vsechny, neni snadne, nicmene to nefunguje, takze jedna hvezda. | pokaždé mě obtěžuje žlutým varováním s požadavkem na update parametrů. proč neumí tak jednoduchou a neustále se opakující činnost dělat apka sama? i bez nutnosti updatu je dole pořád rušící výrazně žluté zbytečné varování, které jsem si už padesátkrát přečetl. rád kliknu na nějaké OK, abych tento fakt potvrdil a aby to už zmizelo, nebo aby to už přestalo výrazně žlutě svítit. | Uz aby to bylo zruseno. Davam tomu tak rok, dva. | Aplikace má za úkol jedinou věc a ani tak nefunguje | Nenacita provedene testy, muzete byt pozitivni a jste v pohode zeleni, protoze jste ockovany. I hygiena priznala, ze tato aplikace absolutne nedela to co by mela, je to defacto jednoucelova Portmonka. | Není vidět do kdy je certifikát platný. | Tečka hezky ukazuje certifikáty o očkování. Ale v případě nemoci ukazuje pár dní pozitivní PCR test, ale po chvíli i ten zmizí (a nyní i z historie?)... a hlavně, čTečka stále ukazuje hezky zeleně validní certifikát očkování. Takže nemocný a silně infekční člověk (pominu že by měl být v izolaci) je tečkou/čtečkou neodhalitelný a klidně po jejím zkontrolování může do restaurací a jinam mezi lidi... | Nefunkční nlze se přihlásit furt jen otevírá další webové stránky | Ještě 2 dny mám nařízenou izolaci kvůli pozitivnímu testu (před 12 dny). Přesto aplikace ukazuje zelený (platný) certifikát o prodělání, který je validní i po načtení čtečkou. | Edit: Díky za reakci, přidávám hvězdu. Ale opravdu myslím jazyk aplikace, nikoliv certifikace. Aplikace používá jazyk telefonu a nelze to změnit. Můžete prosím umožnit uživatelům zvolit jazyk aplikace? Tato možnost tu není a v žádném případě nehodlám měnit jazyk telefonu kvůli ignoranci vývojářů. | Showing certificate as invalid even it is valid. App is useless (as developer confirmed in reply). | Proč není možné změnit jazyk aplikace? | Po updatu nezobrazuje do kolikateho a od kolikateho je certifikat platny a ani nejsou na vyber vsechny clenske zeme EU (Presne ted myslim Dansko ale chybi jich vice). Jinac dela co ma. | Totální sracka vládo polib si prdel | Opravdu skvělá aplikace, gratuluji vývojářům | Zeme ze kterych se ockovani uznava nejsou kontrolovane (alespon ke dni 29/11) - z nejakeho duvodu zmizelo Svedsko (jako cast EU by skoro jiste v seznamu byt melo) a pribylo Togo (jako jedina africka zeme v seznamu). Vypada to ze kdyz nekdo zadaval do seznamu zeme odkud se ockovani uznava, tak vybral ze scrollbaru proste spatne, a nikomu to vubec nevadi, protoze se aplikace nejspis ani netestuje. Pro me (ockovaneho ve svedsku) to ale znamena ze muj certifikat se tvari jako neplatny! Vrcholny amaterismus a totalni QA nedostatek. | Aplikace zatím funguje skvěle :) | nejde změnit jazyk, musím měnit jazyk systému (android) | Odebírám hvězdu, nevím zda za to může aplikace, ale testy u dětí se nahrají (pokud vůbec, u jednoho dítěte se nenahralo do teď) se spozdenim 24 hodin oproti výsledkům z laboratoře. Úplně likvidujete jakoukoliv kredibilitu opatření a ministerstva zdravotnictví. Z prvníma verzema se to dalo pochopit, ale teď je třeba to s tím technickým týmem začít řešit. Není to technická hračka, ovlivňuje to životy!!!! Pokud to nechápou, je třeba najít někoho kdo tomu rozumí. | EDIT: menim hodnoceni, protoze i po systemem rozpoznane a evidovane nakaze mi to porad ukazuje, ze jsem bezinfekcni. Takze u lidi, kteri to neresi (a je jich bohuzel mnoho), kdyz jsou ockovani, tak se vsude muzou prokazat platnou zelenou Teckou, i kdyz jsou covid pozitivni. To je fakt ulet:-/ Jednoduche, srozumitelne, funkcni - to od ministerstvem zadavane apky fakt ocenuji, pac je to velky krok vpred:) | Besides that the application does not work the purpose of it is to illegally discriminate against citizens. Such applications which support dictatorship regimes should not be allowed in appstore. 0/5 | App now finally works, but deletion of invalid tests doesn't (swiping right the test result). Why is the ""feature"" there? ... And PLEASE, if a review is in English and you wanna respond to it, you should respond in English. I know some people are Czech and write English reviews, but that doesn't apply to everyone. | Přes občasné zádrhely, nyní funguje jak má. | Po pondělím zmatku s aktualizacemi je vše opět funkční. | Aplikace, zničila certifikát jako nevalidni, ještě že jsem v Čechách tento týden. Doporučuji dát další vyznamenání | Píše mi to že očkovanie už nie je platné. Nemôžem aktualizovať parametre. V odpovediach na iné recenzie píšete ze sa zmenili podmienky na území v ČR ale nepamätám si žeby bolo rozhodnuté o tom že očkovanie neplatí. Hrozne načasovanie bez upozornenia, veľa ľudí na túto appku spolieha a nenosí certifikát fyzicky. Edit: už to funguje | We can't open our Tecka for cruise traveling.....disgusting | I cannot update the bloody thing since a month. A good old paper with the printed QR code is more reliable. | Od změny propozic prokázání se nelze načíst. I kdyxbych se uklikala na aktualizaci parametrů. Pochybuji, že tato chyba se objevuje u několika případů... spíš si jí ty 4 miliony uživatelů nevšimli... | Po změně parametrů totální zásek, aktualizaci dle návodu nelze provést, aplikace nic nedělá... K vaší odpovědi: nucena údržba asi těžko probíhá celý den. Papírové certifikáty z důvodu nedostupnosti vašeho serveru nejde jednak vytisknout a jednak ani ověřit aplikací čTečka. | Not working today 22.11. Nemohl jsem se dostat do PL pri letu z Frankfurtu do Katowic Really good job 😖 Edit: Diky za odpoved. Pro priste jsem si uz samozrejme vytiskl starou dobrou papirovou verzi. Bohuzel jsem v stejnem kroku smazal aplikaci, na kterou se neda spolehnout, ze bude fungovat. Tudiz zrejme zbytecna prace a to mi apka prisla prakticka a proto jsem ji veril.... Diskuzi co jsem dneska mel ve Frankfurtu s nemeckym policistou (co vyznava skutecny ordnung a uplne nejde ukecavat) nepreji ani nepriteli, co tohle zpusobil. Dost dlouho to vypadalo na vynuceny PCR test a 10dni karanteny nekde v D. | Nefunguje | 21.11.2021 app is totally unusable! Shame to CZ. | Worked quite fine, but from today all certificates are 'red' and with message: 'Last update of parameters is older than 24 hours'. When I click on 'update parameters' nothing happens... | Nefunkční šmejd. Testuje to i váš někdo? Zátěžový test je u vás sprostý slovo, že? NESCHOPNÍ IDIOTI. | Nejde update, nefunguje | terrible and not working now | Mrdka, ukazuje invalid certifikat ockovani :) skvela prace 0/5 | Neplatné certifikáty.. Ani update parametrů nepomáhá | Validation rule does not exist. Pretty useless right now. | My vaccination is displayed as invalid because ""Validation rule does not exist""... I tried to update validation rules but nothing happened, even after application is reinstalled... | Po poslední aktualizaci se nedaří aktualizovat parametry. Android 11 | Po spravnem zobrazeni certifikatu dnes nefunguje, vlastne od 19.11 neukazuje certifikat spravne. Lze jej ovsem pres tecku stahnout v poradku. Co stale nejde v anglicke verzi ""aktualizovat parametry"". UPDATE : ted vsechno jde jak ma | aplikace zobrazuje validny certifikat cervene | Dnešní aktualizace (22.11.2021) katastrofa. Všechny certifikáty neplatné. Oficiální vyjadrení NAKIT jak problém odstranit (aktualizace parametrů) nefunguje. Komunikace k uživatelům zoufalá (jak postupovat pokud problém trva, za jak dlouho bude problém odstraněn atd.). | Po zavedení nových pravidel nefunkční. | Dobrý den, mám platné očkování, přesto v aplikaci je uvedeno invalid. Našla jsem si návod, že mám kliknout na tlačítko aktualizovat. V mé appce není tlačítko aktualizovat... Jsem na služební cestě, děkuji za zpříjemní... | Nefunguje vám to. Nedaří se aktualizovat parametry, po manuálním kliknutí se nic neděje | Platné očkování ukazuje jako neplatné. Aktualizace parametrů nefunguje. Problém přetrvává i po opětovné instalaci. | fails to update status, I appear to be unvaccinated | Přestalo fungovat. Platný certifikát o očkování je nyní červený. Tohle se zase někomu nepovedlo. | Nemám tady žádné testy | Unreliable. Validation rule does not exist. | Dnes, při kontrole v restauraci jsem přišla na to, že Tečka vyhazuje chybovou hlášku, že data nebyla updatovana v posledních 24 hodinácha ukazuje všechny certifikáty (včetně očkování) jako neplatné. Telefon mám připojený na datech 24/7 a stejná hláška vyskočila i kolegům, takže předpokládám, že se jedná o chybu na straně aplikace a bude doručen rychlý fix. | Ukazuje ""Poslední aktualizace parametrů starší než 24 hodin"" i po několika vypnutích a zapnutích, tlačítko ""aktualizovat parametry"" nedělá nic, telefon je přitom připojen k internetu. Od takto důležité aplikace jsem očekávala větší spolehlivost. | Nefunguje aktualizace certifikátů | Příšerné. Po aktualizaci mi chybné ukazuje stav po očkování jako neplatný. Zákaznická linka hovor automaticky položí a není možné čekat na volného operátora, prvně se ukazuje podsvícení s QR kódem, které výpis oči, i když se chci podívat na info o očkování... Hodně špatné. Kdybych mohl jinak, nikdy bych nepoužíval. | Banda tupych neschopnych idiotu... Kdyz uz vyzadujete, ze se MUSIM prokazat ockovanim vsude kam jdu, zaridte at tenhle nesmysl funguje. Aktualizace cerifikatu selhala, pri pokusu o relogin na me vyskoci za probiha udrzba... Vazne? V pondeli v 11 dopoledne? Nemit nahodou u sebe papir o ockovani, nepusti me na certifikaci za nekolik set dolaru! | Můj platný očkovací certifikát ukazuje jako neplatný. Aktualizace parametrů nefunguje - poslední aktualizace parametrů proběhla před 2 dny, ať dělám co dělám. Odinstalováno, budu ukazovat jen pdfko. | Nelze do aplikace nahrát platný certifikát přes SMS. Po dvou pokusech bohužel nic. Podotýkám, že platný certifikát mám a je dostupný na centrální adrese ocko.uzis.cz (mám jej i stažený ve formátu PDF). | Česko Česko Česko🙄 | The app is all in the Czech language and very difficult to navigate. I gave up and printed my document. I have now given the app a 5 star rating as instructions appeared in English... thank you! | Tak jsem prave zjistil, ze tu slavnou aplikaci ""tecka"" muzu pouzit na prokazani bezinfekcnosti a jit do kina. A to prestoze ma aktualni (pro jistotu rucne i aktualizovana) data, pozitivni 4 dni stary test ze soboty zavedeny do systemu a narizena izolace tomu vubec nevadi. Elektronicka online pripojena aplikace, ktera se chova stejne ""aktualne"" jako papir. | Appka propagovana dezinformacni kampaní veřejnými médii. | Freedom app! | It works | Jako systémový jazyk Androidu mám angličtinu, a proto se i Tečka zobrazuje anglicky. Nevím, jak mám detail certifikátu přepnout do češtiny. I když je EN škrtnuté, jsou detaily stále anglicky. Když někde ukazuji na mobilu detail certifikátu, je obsluha z anglického jazyka zmatena. Přitom by stačilo přidat možnost změnit si jazyk (cz/en) v nastavení aplikace (texty už přeložené máte). | Hello, I got the certificate and now I forgot my password to enter to the app Tečka.  How can I reset the password? Or do I need to delete the app and do it again? | Good system. | Nějak nechápu, proč se v aplikaci čtečka komukoliv kdo ""kontroluje"" zobrazuje moje jméno a datum narození. Obsluhu ( v jakémkoliv podniku ) tato informace absolutně nezajímá a nedokáže ji ani ověřit. Tohle se mi opravdu nelíbí. | Funguje tak jak má. | Kde jsou moje testy? | Nelze se přihlásit. | Funguje dobře, všudy kudy chodím mám najednou 5G | Aplikace nefunguje. V momentě, kdy musím tečku ukazovat všude, se rozhodne, že potřebuji aktualizaci. Aktualizace nejde stáhnout. Po odinstalaci nejde ani stáhnout zpět. Super. | Dnes jsem vyzkoušel a zatím funguje. | App whose only purpose is to show picture requires update to work. | Impossible to load my certificate. I'm able to go till the SMS step, but after that, the page shows error. Same for NIA page - The option to sign in with electronics ID, never loads. | Neni mozne obnovit zapomenuty pin 👎 | Přidat přes SMS certifikát tak jednoduše nejde.. je to velice neintuitivní.. odkáže vás to na ocko.uzis kde si musíte stáhnout certifikát v PDF formě do mobilu, vrátit se do aplikace a přidat certifikát ve skutečnosti přes QR kód kde se otevře kamera tam je potřeba kliknout na ikonku souboru s lupou jež vás odkáže do adresáře fotek. Ten je potřeba přepnout na stažené soubory kam se stáhnul certifikát a z něj si aplikace ověří QR a přidá certifikát do aplikace.. moje máti by to nezvládla. Děs | Chcete si přečíst info o podmínkách použití a sběru osobních údajů? Smůla. Stránka na toto téma neexistuje :-p Tvárnice a vládní aplikace nebrat! | Pracuje jak má | Tak tohle musel navrhovat někdo pod vlivem.Nejsem IT specialista , nicméně nejsem IT negramota , ale tohle je absolutně nanic apka. | Forced updates. | Not really usable if you use a VPN (for example to bee safe at a foreign airport wifi), as uzis.cz considers it an attack and blocks access. | I have no sms service abroad, just email, how can i get an id code.. | Nejdebilnejsi apka co existuje. Vůbec mi nechce nic normalne udělát. Bože s tím je ***ni | Won't show my test results when attempting through SMS. Claims that ""I attempted to many logins"" with no other Information. What's the point of doing a test when I cannot even access my results and a certificate when I need to travel? Can't believe tax money actually goes to this. | Doesnt even download | Slozita registrace. Nekdy priste to zkusim znovu. Zatim jsem odinstalival, aby to neprekazelo v telefonu. | Od nainstalování a nastavení byla apka otevřená přesně 0 krát. | Je to na nic | Mamka má telefon (Samsung, ne žádný noname) z r. 2015 a aplikace jí nejde stáhnout, že zařízení není podporováno. Stejně tak když si otevře ocko.uzis, tak je stránka rozházená a nejde na nic kliknout (ostatní stránky se načítají úplně normálně). Super motivace pro lidi, aby aplikaci používali. :))) | Obecně asi fajn. Přihlášení přes NIA funguje krásně a zobrazuje se co má. ALE bylo by u očkování fajn mít v detailech vypsaná data jednotlivých dávek. Na některých letištích to po mně chtěli. EDIT: Díky za odpověď, ale s prominutím, buď jste nečetli mé hodnocení nebo nevíte, o čem mluvíte. Data jednotlivých dávek v aplikaci nejsou. | Nejde validace pro jiné země. Z toho důvodu je to pro mě k ničemu. A kdy ta nova verze bude? Tohle neni nic sloziteho na vyvoj. Nechapu co vam na tom trva tak dlouho. | Certifikáty s prošlou platnosti označovat jako nevalidní (invalid vs expired)? Jako srsly? | After installation and some firewall tunning everything works fine. | Nefunkcni, registrace pres sms nefunguje Ani jedna varianta...","{""1"":3298,""2"":429,""3"":726,""4"":757,""5"":2786}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Ministerstvo zdravotnictví České republiky","6973241785916756870","podpora.ict@nakit.cz",,"Palackého náměstí 375/4

You can also buy tickets without registering 

The application displays information about current closures and offers the user a list of P+R car parks with information about their current capacity. It also allows you to purchase several single tickets in one go which the passenger then activates as and when required. The user can also forward the purchased ticket to another user who has the application installed on their device. Tickets purchased via the PID Lítačka application are valid in all of the Prague Integrated Transport zones, i.e. also in the integrated parts of the Central Bohemian Region, including trains operated by České dráhy.

What the application offers 
- Simple searching for public transport connections in the Prague Integrated Transport system
- Recommendation of the cheapest fare for your route in the Prague Integrated Transport system
- Display of a connection map including navigation to the stop 
- Information about current departures from stops  
- Ticket payment using a bank card or Masterpass
- Option of monitoring the validity of your Prague Integrated Transport ticket
- Forwarding of a Prague Integrated Transport ticket to another application user
- Monitoring the current number of free spaces in P+R car parks and navigation directly to them
- Purchase of up to 10 Prague Integrated Transport tickets at once and their activation as and when required before boarding a Prague Integrated Transport vehicle.
- Monitoring the status of wheelchair facilities 
- Can also be used for travel using Prague Integrated Transport trains and Prague Integrated Transport suburban buses","The new PID Lítačka mobile application completely replaces the PID Info transport application.

Jestli můžu poprosit, udělejte s těmi notifikacemi něco. | Sometimes fails, saying ""not installed from an official source"" even though I installed it through Google Play Store. That makes it very scary to use, because I never know whether I can show my ticket or not. | Vyhledávání zastávek nefunguje, ať píšu co píšu nic se nezobrazuje, jediné jak lze zadat zastávku je manuálně z mapy. | Nějak to funguje,ale proč je část aplikace česky a část anglicky? V nastavení mám nastavenou češtinu. | After last update is totally unusable. Endless flashing by display after start. A new version resolve the issue. Thanks | To the public: Be aware please - today happened to me what people have mentioned before: the bus was late and I activated the ticket immediately after entering the bus. The ticket inspector saw this, and immediately fined me CZK1,000 because of an invalid ticket on his electronic equipment! Dear PID Litacka...please 🙏 the application needs the option to invalidate the ticket immediately when entering a bus!! That option should be available, just like with normal paper tickets. | snaha o zlepsovani se ceni... ale nechapu proc pri cestovani vlakem mimo Prahu apka nedokaze odecist aktivni rocni kupon a doporucit nejvyhodnejsi jizdenky... v souvislosti se systemem pasem kdy je P O B centrum jako 4 pasma je to vždy výpočetní dobrodrůžo s hledáním stanice kde centrum končí a kolik dalších zón je potřeba:)) | Aplikace funguje skvěle, lze nastavit aktivaci jízdenky jak manuálně, tak automaticky. Je však důležité si dát pozor na dvouminutovou lhůtu před opravdovou aktivací lístku, ale na ni i sama aplikace upozorní. Lístky na delší dobu taky fungují dobře, nikdy jsem s nimi problém neměla. Doporučuji :) | I have multiple requests for this application. 1. Create please an adaptive color icon for Android 14. 2. Make the name shorter to one word ""Litacka"". It will look cleaner in app drawer on Android! 3. Create a dark mode for application. It's a basic feature for all modern application and it's weird to not have it these days. Thank you! | Dobré odpoledne, děkuji za dobrou aplikaci. Používám už hodně let. Dnes jsem dostal problém. Aplikace dokáže najít cestu na letiště z jakékoli zastávky. Z letiště to ale jinak nejde. Verze aplikace 4.0.2. Hezký víkend, | Thie ticket QR code NEVER scans properly on suburban buses (where you have to present tickets to the driver when boarding). Make your QR codes more clear and compatible with different display sizes. | I like the app. Much better than most other European cities public transport apps around. Things to improve? Of course. | Terrible. After the last update all purchased tickets disappeared. | pokaždé když se snažím si koupit lístek na delší dobu (třeba roční) tak se mi nejméně dvakrát ukáže error, peníze se mi strhnou a za 10 minut se mi vrátí na účet a můžu to zkoušet znovu. Tenhle problém už se mi děje víc jak rok :/ | Proč na záložce mapa není mapa.pid.cz? To je tak obrovský nevyužitý potenciál. Mapa se zastávkami by mohla mít alespoň čísla linek. Takto to není moc užitečné. Lepší je otevřít mapy.cz tam je víc informací. | Aplikace se při přepnutí do jízdeneky a v ní záložku kupóny spadne a sice načte data ale nedá se použít pro revizora protože vždy spadne dokud nepřehodím záložku do pár sekund po startu do záložku vyhledávání | Are you serious? Mám kupón a dnes se aktualizovala aplikace a po spuštění nejen že pořád problikava obrazovka ale po smazání cookies vůbec není identifikátor v aplikaci. Blázni. A teď se to otevřelo, piplo a kontrolorka řekla, že identifikátor nenalezen. | Nová verze aplikace se nedá používat! Chybí jí nějaké oprávnění kvůli čemuž neustále jen bliká dialogové okno a nejde vůbec nic udělat, samozřejmě ani zobrazit zakoupený kupón. | The latest (new) version of app keeps crashing on Pixel 8 Pro, Android 14. | Když si jako výchozí místo dám Praha, vždy to nejde spojení ze zastávky Staroměstská! Tohle jsem fakt nikde neviděl... Podle aplikace není spojení z Masarykova n. do Nymburka přes Poříčany! EDIT Podívejte se na IDOS, Pubtran, CG Transit, pro ně ten váš ""široký pojem"" problém není. Spojení do NB Lítačka nenajde, pošlu vám screenshoty, jestli chcete (obávám se, že výsledky dává každou chvíli jiné). Apka mi nevyhovuje, protože nefunguje - jak si mám asi koupit jízdenku, když mi nenajde spoj? | I've reinstalled it a few times, nothing has changed | Been using the app for about a year or two.. This morning - obviously after an automatic update.. Infinite message box blinking and saying that notifications are not enabled. Cannot click on any button because the box just keeps appearing and disappearing. Workaround: enable the main notification switch in settings (particular notifications may then be disabled by individual switches). | This app has stolen 1500kc from my account. It failed to purchase a ticket but still took the money out | I have to applaud the team behind this app, the feature set is great and works like a charm. I appreciated the option to easily transfer transit passes between devices in a matter of seconds. | Naprosto stupidni propojeni s Idolkou. Pri pokusu o registraci na Idol se clovek dozvi, ze ucet uz existuje. Dobre, reset hesla. Jenze to cloveku zresetuje heslo na PID, odhlasi z Litacky, ale nejen z ni, ale taky z Rekola a Nextbike! Pri pokusu reset hesla na Pid pak nekonecne klikani na obrazky motorek. | Dear developers. You actually need to add lower measure to start validity from for year pass. I could choose start date earlier than my previous pass finished. It's really annoying. Other customers, be careful and check twice start date before you buy a new pass!!! | Super aplikace pro dopravu v Praze. Hvězdičku strhávám za to, že při nákupu jízdenky více kategorii musím provést více plateb a nejde udělat jeden košík a ten zaplatit najednou. Strašně to zdržuje a určitě i provozovatel plati více na provizi za platbu kartou:-) | Na vyhledávání spojů ok, ale pokaždé, když se v aplikaci snažím zakoupit Lítačku, peníze se mi odečtu z účtu, ale Litacka nikde, prý platba selhala. :) Peníze pak sice vždy vrátí, ale nechápu, proč raději neopraví ten problém. Několik mých kolegů má podobnou zkušenost. Raději doporučuji kupovat kupony přímo ve stanicích metra. | Je to pekne. Jen zakoupene jizdenky jsou nahle ukradeny s tim, ze se meni cena. Bez pozadani emailem nejsou vraceny. Kupovat jizdenky dopredu je tedy zcela bez jistoty ze nebudou opet ukradeny. | Aplikace každých 5 vteřin spadne a není možné ji používat. | Foregin tourists beware! In their search for money, the public transport company will fine you 1000 Czech crowns despite having a purachased and activated ticket, simply because of a technicality - a two minute timer on the activation. Buy your tickets physically! That way the ticket inspectors (who get a commission from the transport company for ever person they ""catch"") will go home empty handed! | Aplikace vždy spadne když chci najet na zakoupené permanentky. Jsem zvědavý, co tomu bude říkat revizor... | Dřív šlo konfigurovat jaké záložky si zobrazit v dolním menu, teď cpete natvrdo věci, co mě nezajímají a to co chci dát nejde. Nebo je to tak neintuitivní, že jsem na to nepřišel. JŘ radši hledám přes google mapy, tahle ""oficiální"" hrůza ani neumí zobrazit zatahující spoje, ostuda. Výběry se neustále resetují při každém překliku, neskutečně otravné. Takže jediná použitelná funkce je zobrazení kupónu revizorovi, to je teda trochu málo... | Just got fined 1k because your app is incapable of charging me 3 times in a row. Good job! | Keeps crashing.. have to screenshot to show it to the validator of the tickets. | Application started to crash, I have a one year pass that I can't use anymore 😭😅 nice move PID Upd: crashes only when I go to Tickets page. 💪 | What's the point of setting favorite tickets if they get forgotten? | Nefunkční, nelze se vůbec přihlásit. Když dám obnovit heslo a přes zaslaný link ho úspěšně změním, ani na nové heslo se stejně nedá přihlásit. O překlep jistě nejde, heslo se plní ze správce hesel. Nepodporuje tematické ikony. | Nelze se připojit k serveru. Paráda, když si člověk předem nakoupí lístky, ale pak je nemůže aktivovat... Zkusil jsemni smazat všechna data aplikace a nelze se ani přihlásit ke svému účtu. | Aplikace crashne vždy pokud otevřu záložku s lístky nebo průkazkou, takže si lístky nemůžu přes aplikaci koupit, ani se přes aplikaci prokázat. Tímto je bohužel zcela nefunkční pro tento účel, takže se s ní dají pouze vyhledávat spoje :( už je to pár měsíců, tak doufám, že to dříve nebo později opravíte, protože jinak jsem doteď byl s appkou maximálně spokojen. | I have bought the ticket but it said insufficient balance in the card and also the amount deducted as well. Customer service not available to call, please return the money I have paid through online | Super appka, bohužel když bylo potřeba tak nebylo možné aby se načetla, pořád padala.... Musela jsem odinstalovat a zase nainstalovat, pak to fungovalo - samozřejmě ale až poté co mi vypsal revizor pokutu. | Crashes when I start it, I use nothing phone 2, it runs android | After last update impossible to purchase monthly pass via the app. 5 purchase errors in a row for Google Pay and Card Payment | mohlo by tam být i přehled o lítačce třeba do kdy platí kupon nebo tak, já si to nepamatuju a nechce se mi to hledat a ani otravovat paní u pultíku, popřípadě i dobíjet lítačka.. 😅 Po nove aktualizaci pada a nejde ji ani otevrit. | Pořád nemá tmavý režim | Proboha, proc si nemuze aplikace pri zavreni, nebo prepnuti pamatovat poslwdni heldani. Otravne porad zadavat dokola. | Would be great app without 2 minute rule for ticket activation. | Po spuštění, kdy potřebuje člověk ukázat nebo koupit jízdenku, tahá nějaké megabyty aktualizačních dat. To to nejde o aspoň pět minut odložit nebo pozastavit? | Přesun kuponů z fyzické karty na appku je mnohem jednodušší než jsem si myslel. Doporučuji | Prosím pozor na tuto aplikaci v určitých situacích Vás obírá o peníze. Např pokud si koupíte lístek a autobus má zpoždění a lístek expiruje tak si musíte lístek koupit znova. Raději si kupujte lístky v autobuse nikoli přes aplikaci. | It should show more notifications before the expiry of a pass. 29.11.2023: Cannot purchase a pass for second day straight. It shows ""purchase error "" | reliable and well done. must have for visitors | Crashing on pixel 8 | It provides basic navigation but even though it is not accurate, you can not get home reliability... | perfektní, jebat idos | Aplikace crashuje hned po startu, mám nejnovější verzi. Bohužel nejsem schopen předkládat svůj pass. Tohle je možné asi jen v ČR :). | Absolutely horrid software. Also password reset emails take way too long to be sent. Never mind the fact that the message of incorrectly input password is permanently stuck for me. | A great app for a great public transport system! | Super appka. Máte v plánu do ní zaintegrovat i současný web mapa.pid.cz? | Po otevření karty ""Tickets"" aplikace pokaždé spadne | Usually the app works fine however today I needed to travel several times with the 90min ticket. When I tried to activate third ticket for the third ride, the app told me I am entitled for Fare capping and forced me to ""Activate"" this option. However when I follow the process and press activate, I receive a message ""Ticket activation failed, please check your tickets or repeat activation again"". This keeps repeating and preventing me from using already bought tickets. Sigh... | Everything works so far, I use it already 3 years | Po nainstalování na pixel 8 android 14 aplikace nefungovala. Při pokusu o zobrazení stránky s kuponem a QR kódem aplikace okamžitě spadla. Komplet vymazání dat, odinstalovani a nainstalování zpátky ovšem pomohlo, a už to jde. | There was an issue with the app but now it works fine! Thanks for fixing the issue! | No olnline card accept. Very inconvenient. | Podstatně lepší způsob placení jízdného než hledání automatů. Oproti SMS si navíc můžete vybrat libovolný tarif. Aktivace jízdenek by zasloužila zlepšení. Nelze např. hromadně vybrat a aktivovat více předem zakoupených jízdenek. Musíte aktivovat jednu po druhé, nebo všechny aktivovat ihned při zakoupení. Výběr pásem je hloupý. Když vyberete P, mohlo by apce dojít, že má rovnou vybrat následující pásma dle jízdenky, nebo by aspoň mohla dynamicky zakázat pásma mimo dosah od prvního vybraného. | Chcete aby Vám lidi platili tisíce za pitomý jízdenky? Tak si to doháje opravte.... nejdou ani načíst spoje vy idioti | Update je nešťastný. Na text se velmi špatně dívá, text je moc malý, všechno nalepené na sebe, chaos | Finally added option to enter address and app giving you route. Thank u! Can u pls add dark mode? | Redesign se povedl. Teď už jenom zbývá přidat možnost při vyhledávání schovat tlačítko na zakoupení lístku, když mám zakoupený kupon. | It frequently crashes on Samsung S23. | Rozbitá nefunkcni zabugovana appka. Ostuda. | Nelze nastavit samoaktivaci jízdenky. Vlak jede v 15:09 a aplikace nabízí pouze aktivaci 0-12 hodin a pak sama sobě hlásí error. Ruční aktivace, zdá se, funguje... | The app seems fine. It only won't tell you enough about ticket activation so that the control fraudsters can rip off tourists. Garbage mentality next to Hungary 🗑️🗑️ | Just pre paid for a three day ticket , so far so good, payment went straight through in Google Pay, but won't know how good until activating and using once there. Will update then. | The 2-minutes-to-activate-ticket rule makes this app worthless. What is it there for? It's better to take your chances and buy no ticket at all if you get fined anyway. Buying paper tickets is more reliable. | Nefunkční aplikace. Verifikační emaily nechodím | I can't buy any tickets. Just says error please try again. Even reinstalling using Google pay or bank card doesn't matter. Same error and I can't buy tickets. | Nepřišla notifikace o konci platnosti permice na rok! Kdybych si to nekontroloval, jel bych na černo!!! | The ticket does not vibrate or notify you when it is activated, so it's easy to miss the tram. When buying a pass, the time periods are in Czech, so it's hard to know what you are buying. | Aplikace se zlepšuje, ale stále je ještě dost prostoru pro pokrok. Ale každopádně užitečná aplikace. | Dobrá aplikace, ale vadí mi že na iOS je jiný, novější, dle mého názoru lepší design než na Android. | The app failed to active the ticket and cost me a fine. | First time in Praha, bought a ticket, found buses and trams I needed. | Works perfectly | Rychlá a intuitivní aplikace, používám na parkování a MHD. Nevěděl jsem jen jak přidat platební kartu natrvalo, ale je možný zaškrtnout uložení při kupování jízdenky. | very rigid but confusing UI | It works very well. The only problem that I would like is reviewed, is that you have to choose between the plastic card, or the app. It should be able to use both. | Attention! The app let me buy a ticket and link it to my card but never clarified that the card cannot be a virtual one. I got fined and when I told them that it is not stated anywhere they told me that they are aware and that they will fix it... However they never took back the fine. | There are too many bugs and the app is still imperfect, I still don't understand why they can't support adding the card to Google Pay and Apple Wallet. | S aplikací nemůžu být více než spokojen. Vše funguje tak, jak má. Jen tak dál. 👍 | I really liked it before, but I am trying to buy a new pass and it doesn't matter which kind of payment I use, it still is not working... Before this, the app was quite nice | I moved my yearly pass from my credit card into the app and it started crashing, but I managed to fix it by reinstalling the app. Apart from this issue, it works fine. It is nice to have Prague parking feature included in the app. | Nejde koupit jizdenka, různé typy jizdenek neustále mizí | Date selection widget is bugged in the registration menu. Disregards selected date of birth and assigns a random one which cannot be changed without visiting an office. | It's keep crashing 😫 | Thank you so much for providing multiple languages, and making it easy to buy tickets! It did seem at first that the tickets bought through search and through the ticket page were different. I'm glad that it's not the case. | The app has been working without any errors for the last six months. I linked Google Pay in the app and paid for all tickets with it. At some point I just couldn't buy tickets in the app. After numerous attempts I got a simple error - failed to buy tickets, try again another time. I linked my bank card instead of Google Pay, but that didn't help either. Then I decided to reinstall the app. Even after reinstalling, I'm not able to buy tickets either through Google pay or banking card. | Zadal jsem špatně příjmení a teď ho nemohu změnit a ani si tam dát účet | Unusable. Crashes a few seconds after startup for no reason. Samsung galaxy s10. | Crashing a few seconds after every launch, unable to use | Stále stejné hodnocení. Aplikace na Google Pixel 7 a Android 13 okamžitě spadne. 30.7.23 - přeinstalace pomohla diky | Neposílal ověřovací mail | Dnes jsem chtel zaplatit parkovani v Holesovicich. Zadal jsem SPZ, zvolil 30 minut delky, a zaplatil. K memu velkemu udivu, aplikaci sama zvolila zacatek parkovani az o hodinu a pul pozdeji, takze pro me uplne k nicemu. Edit: po neuspokojivem vysvetleni od vyvojaru snizim hodnoceni na nejnizsi mozne. | Hodně špatné hledání navazujících spojů, často mi nabízí jen jednu variantu, a kdybych nevěděla, že je i jiná a vhodnější možnost, tak si zbytečně zajedu. Noa o spojích Českých drah škoda mluvit, co to je sakra za komunikaci???? Kontroluji v aplikaci, jestli vlak jede, tak stojím na zastávce/nádraží, vlak nikde a apka stále hlásí žádné zpoždění a vlak už vyjel ze stanice.. omg, pokaždé fakt frustrující, k čemu mi to pak je, kdybych to věděla hned, tak jsem mohla jít na bus nebo něco... | Reinstall fixed the crash, thanks. | Když kupujete roční litacku aplikace bude ukazovat chybu, ale transakce bude probíhat bez vašeho vědomí. Vrácení peněz tým Litacky nepořídí, musíte jet na pobicku DPP. Servis level 1/10. | I bought 2 same tickets and purchased via credit card, money was paid but it didn't show up in application. Please help to find them or return money back. | DOESN'T WORK. | Nemožnost mít Lítačku na kartě a mobilu zaroveň. | Hrůza. Chcete zjistit, kolik je zón při cestě z Prahy do Přelouče? Vyhraďte si aspoň hodinu na studium systému pid. Jednoduché zadání startu a cíl je v apce dobře schované, ale počet zón vám stejně nesdělí. Budete studovat podmínky plné podivností a výjimek a pak hledat v titěrné mapě. A když koupíte ve zmatené apce omylem špatnou jízdenku? Nebojte, vrátit jednoduše nejde, nebo se nikde nedozvite jak. | Kupovaný předem koupená 3 měsíční jízdenka začala platit rovnou dnes, když mám ještě platný pas na 4 dní, předtím to fungovalo dobře. Dobrý podvod teda | I was charged for the tickets but I did not received them in the app | Nakup cehokoliv je naprosta amaterina. | You can plan your route, calculate your fare costs and buy ticket in one app. Alas, you cannot reserve your place in PID S-trains. Developers can implement smooth transitions between prepaid coupons. Now it is not implemented. I was offered a coupon starting from the actual day, while I had few more days prepaid. | Neustále padá. | First impression is fine, please add bank id authentication to avoid yet another credentials. | Nechápu proč tu funkci s NFC neodeberete úplně a místo toho neimplementujete ty Google Wallet lístky... nefunguje to ani u terminálu ani u revizorů | Beware that if you buy a ticket for multiple travellers, it is not possible to use a scrrenshot or download a pdf. Only the person who purchases the ticket will get a ticket with QR code on the app. | Již několikrát se mi stalo, že vymrzne vyhledávání spoje. Po stisknutí vyhledat se objeví dilaogové okno searching a nic se neděje. Dalo by se a tim něco udělat? Jinak vse funguje v pořádku. Díky. Vypadá že to pomohlo. Díky 👍 | Update2: Nepomáhá nic! Rucni aktualizace nefunguje, tlacitko zesedne a nic se nestahne. Neponaha vymazani cache, restart telefonu, reinstalace. Ani pres mobilni sit ani pres wifi. Proste tragedie! / Ohavnost. Po dalším výrazném zdražení nelze v aplikaci zakoupit jizdenky pro Středočeský kraj na jednotlivou jízdu. Skvělá práce, wow! A kdybych měl hodnotit i nové ceny, tak v době, kdy ceny energií a paliv jsou na hodnotách před krizí, nafta je dokonce levnější, dal bych 0 hvězd, kdyby to šlo. | vypada, ze to preinstalovani pomohlo, diky | Půlku doby mi vyhledávání spojení skončí dlouhým čekáním a nic. Aplikace špatně pracuje s více auty - opakovaně mi (minimálně vizuálně) prodloužila parkování u špatného auta. Celkově by bylo lepší auto zvolit pomocí drop-down menu před platbou. | Jako vazne overovaci emaily pri registraci odesilate rucne? Na vytvoreni uctu clovek aby si bral dovolenou. Aspon me sakra pustte do aplikace s hlaskou ze jsem neoveren. | Zadávám platné číslo ISIC karty, ale nechce mě to pustit (neplatná karta) | Uz podruhe se mi stalo, ze jsem zaplatil za jizdenku/jizdenky (a aktivoval je) a pak v aplikaci nebyly dostupne, prip. jen nektere. | Very poor design, if you use then ""plan root"" to check the price you need to pay, and purchase the ticket from there, of you buy more then needed tickets, they are all being validated at once and there is no way to stop the process. Also, if you do it, the validation starts from the time the software decides, if you enter to an earlier tram, you can not tell it to start 'now Bad design, bad planing. | neakceptuje moji ISIC kartu | Cannot pay with Google Pay | Perfect app, thanks to the developers 🙏 | Verification e-mail doesn't even come | Дякуємо за українізацію, але ж в меню обрання мови в чеському та англомовному інтерфейсах написано ""Український"", а це не про мову :) Виправте, будь ласка | Spomalila app, načítá dlouho. | Za 3 dňový lístok som zaplatil, v banke platbu vidím že prešla, ale lístok nemám, kupoval som vo vlaku a vošli sme práve do tunela, očakávam teda vrátenie peňazí ... peniaze boli vrátené na účet, všetko je teda v poriadku, ďakujem | The app is malfunctioning during ticket purchase, it's been the second time during the last year, that instead of buying 1 monthly pass, the app charges your account 2 times and so you buy two at once, and BOTH become activated at the same time. To return the money, you need to go PERSONALLY to their office! Ridiculous and incomprehensible!!! It's 2023, HELLO CZECH DEVELOPERS ARE YOU ONLY GOOD FOR DRINKING BEER?! 🤬 UPD. Seriously?! Contact DPP due error in your app not corrected for year?! 💩 | Just tried to register and order Litacka online. Its not working. Useless service. | Kupování kupónů atd. naprosto v pořádku, avšak nedokážu zprovoznit NFC pro použití telefonu jako kartu, což byl jeden z velkých důvodů proč jsem kupon kupoval na mobil a ne na kartu. Za to prostě musí body dolů a bylo by úžasné kdyby s tím vývojář něco dělal. | Nefunguje vyhledání spojů, do nekonečna jen načítá. Reinstalace na chvíli pomohla, po dalším spuštění opět nefunguje. | total useless app, uninstall the app immidiatly and start buying the ticket from the bus using the card. since activation of the ticket takes 2 mins checker can still fine you if you have 15 second left in activation. and there is no way you can activate the ticket immidiatly. on the other hand you can buy the ticket in the bus and it does not matter it takes 2 or 3 mins checker can not fine you. This app is the scheme to wrongfully fine the commuter. a big scam. | Užitečná aplikace a z technického hlediska a UI je celkem ok. Používám roční kupón tak neřeším ten '2 minutový countdown ' aktivace jednorázové jízdenky. Řešení není nejšťastnější když cestující potřebuje ihned nastoupit. Nový update mapy odjezdů je ok a placení parkovného (auta) je plus. | Aplikace dnes přestala fungovat po update. Otevře se a než načte zakoupenou měsíční jízdenku tak se zase sama zavře. Today the app stopped working. App opens and before loading the purchased monthly ticket it closes itself. | Regarding the new parking feature I'm wondering who was behind the idea with the car colors. The most common color of the world, the white is missing. Literally how this got missed even from QA. Update on the dev answer: yes it's difficult to distinguish but this can be takled by using name as well. I understand that doesn't play any role (only if you have the rare case of same model/different colors) but still, is a app feature and either shouldn't exist or be proper. | Je hezké že zaměstnávají invalidy. Ale mentálne retardovaní by opravdu neměly pracovat na oddělení komunikace se zákazníky!!! A na oddělení vývoje to taky není o nic lepší. Příšerná aplikace! Příšerný přístup k platícím zákazníkům!!! | Funguje. | Poslední verze je neskutečně pomalá. Téměř nepoužitelné | There is no way to activate the ticket immediately so I activate it as soon as I see the bus coming but this time the check was straight when I entered the bus causing the ticket still having 30 seconds left to activate costing me a 1000 crowns! | Android App doesn't show the departure schedule at the stops. iOS App has no problem with it. | Dvouminutový odpočet do aktivace listku bez jakéhokoliv upozornění předem je naprosto pitomý nápad. Jestli je to způsob, jak vybrat od turistů na pokutách, tak bych to označila za podvod. Používala jsem podobné aplikace v různých evropských městech a žádná to neměla. DPP evidentně víc zajímá výběr pokut, než komfort cestujících. Update: Vyjádření PID nic nemění na tom, že je to špatně navržená funkce a uživatele mate. | The ticket system is garbage, I got a 1000czk fine for activating a ticket only 1 minute before entering the tram. Am I supposed to activate it before seeing the tram? What if it's late, then I just lose a ticket, or if it's early I cannot board? Anywhere in the world you activate ticket when entering the transport, not 2 minutes before. | Nelze hledat spojeni bez internetu (minimalne pro predstavu jaka cisla odkud jedou...), planovani spojeni pres urcitou zastavku je tezkopadne, jinak dobry. Bylo by super, kdyby sel na plose udelat zastupce pro Oblibene spojeni. | Amateurish application Inability to properly buy tickets for a group. It's inadequate if you have a child that's less than 6, another less than 18 and if you also want to buy it for seniors. It's impossible to group all the people you want and pay once for all. | Bylo by skvělé kdyby do aplikace byla implementována mapa.pid.cz Kde by rozkliknuti spoje ukázalo jeho polohu na mape | Dobrý den, přejmenujte to na TRAMVAJENKU. Vůbec nikdo NAROZENÝ v Praze tomu nikdy neřekl lítačka (zvracím). To je leda pojmenování, který používaj burani a vidláci naplavený v Praze, protože tomu tak říkaj ve svejch vesnicích. Děkuji předem. | Je sice praktické mít pas vždy po ruce. Nicméně pokaždé, když si chci koupit nový kupón, musim odinstalovat a naistalovat aplikaci, jinak mě to nenechá si ho koupit... | Vehicle location data is unreliable. It happened to me many times that I watched tram supposedly pass trough the stop in the app, without any vehicle actually passing trough. Turns out that trams that are cancelled still appear in the system as traveling according to schedule. The app in no way indicates that you're waiting for a ghost tram. DEV RESPONSE: I see ""is_cancelled"" as part of response to vehicle positions request in PT Output Gateway API. Does dev claim that Golemio data is invalid? | Doesn't recognise english charater | Za mě prostě funguje, splňuje očekávání. Navíc možnost se přihlásit a vidět historii atd. Snadná platba přes platební karty. | Dokonala aplikacia Abolutna spokojnost, presne takto sa to ma robit. Moznost zakupenia listkov, casovana aktivacia, navigacia, cestovne poriadky, route planner. Nas predlzeny vikend v Prahe bol vdaka tejto aplikacii, co sa tyka vyuzivania MHD, uplna pohoda. Ziadne nervy v zmysle ""ako sa dostaneme tam a tam"", vsetko prehladne a lahko pouzitelne. Dakujeme! | Nejde nastavit aby sa listok vzdy aktivoval po zakupeni. Musi sa to zakazdym prenastavovat rucne na ""aktivaciu po zakupeni"". Dalsie velke negativum je, ze listok je platny az po dvoch minutach po zakupeni. Cize ako tidit musite dve minuty cakat zatial co vam mhd odchadza zo zastavky. A ak vam expiruje platobna karta, tak nemate moznost cez aplikaciu zadat novu, alebo vobec menit platobne sposoby. | Worst application the payment get stuck and doesn't initiates. | All in one place, quick online tickets, nice app overall! | Please, make a brightness setting optional. I use only NFC and I don't need the brightness automatically to be automatically turned to the maximum level. Edit: The payment by Google Pay wallet would be triggered in the use case you described. | CAUTION: It takes 2 mins to activate the ticket after you buy it AND don't get on any public transportation untill it's FULLY activated or you might get a $40 fine if there is a ticket inspector. It's not mentioned in the app or at the stations but even if you did buy the ticket in advance, you are not allowed to get on train/bus/subway until it's fully activated. | Dělá to, co má :) | Funguje veľmi dobre. Možno už mám nízke očakávania z minulosti, ale rozhodne som spokojný s tým ako momentálne všetko beží hladko 👍 | Funguje jak má | Activation after 2 minutes, seriously? | When trying to purchase a ticket it just hangs forever with the message ""Processing order..."" | Odhadnout kdy mám koupit lístek s dostatečným předstihem 2 minut je skoro nemožné, pokud mám čas tak pak stojím před metrem jak idi...t, nebo případně nastupuji ještě bez platného lístku, aby mi to neujelo. Registrace účtu abych mel všechny funkce je nejspíš nemožná, zkusil sem 3 mailové adresy a na žádnou mi nedorazil aktivační link, teda čekal sem jenom asi 1 den, tak možná ještě někdy příjde. Lístky nejsou navíc ani výhodnější jak papírové, narozdíl třeba od Brna kde je to přes app. levnější | Receipt download does not work | Snizuji hodnoceni na 2 hvezdy, protoze jsem diky zmatecne sprave jizdenek uz nekolikrat prisel o penize. | Již jsem dříve přeinstaloval a problém se vrátil. Velmi nespolehlivé. | Aplikace sama o sobě je fajn, ale nečekejte žádný customer support. Nedařilo se koupit lístek, pak ztrhli Kč a listek nikde. Kontaktovali mě, abych popsala problém. Dle jejich odpovědi bylo jasné, že přečetli maximálně tři věty a doporučili mi, abych zkontrolovala, jestli mám dost peněz na kartě a jestli mám vůbec internet, to vše tónem, který naznačoval vážné pochyby o mém celkovém IQ. I kdyz bohužel konkurence k apce není, vrátím se pouze pod hrozbou smrtelného násilí mé celé rodině. | Incredibly useless application, can not delete identification and photo out of my profile. | Aplikace me z niceho nic odhlasila, pak pri pokusu o prihlaseni info, ze mam ucet docasne zablokovany. Zjistit to v MHD neni nic prijemneho, vratim se k plastove karticce. | The app doesn't have a dark mode, which make the user experience very unpleasant! Also there is no option to turn off the automatic brightness adjustment when viewing the ""Passes"" screen, so it blinds you when buying/viewing a pass in the evening. | The English string on expiration notification is wrong, saying ""After 3 minutes, the ticket xyz expires"". It should state ""In 3 minutes ..."". As it stands now, it implies that the ticket was valid only for 3 minutes total and expired right now, which isn't true. | Při přesunu na nový telefon se převod kupónu provedl bez problémů. Po vypršení jeho platnosti jsem na novém telefonu provedl nákup nového kupónu. Ten se ovšem umístil na starý telefon. V aplikaci na novém telefonu nesvítí žádné upozornění o vypršení platnosti kupónu, ani informace, že jediný platný kupón je na jiném telefonu. Kvůli tomuto UX nezdaru jsem při kontrole inspektorem prodělal 50 Kč. | Neni mozne si koupit listek z Prahy do Plzne a cela aplikace ma blby, neprehledny a neorganizovany UI ve kterem se lechce ztratite. | La app tiene un problema al realizar la compra online con una tarjeta de RB la app queda congelada y después de muchos tiempo (1 hora)sale que la operación está cancelada. Esto es un problema frecuente que ocasiona muchas problemas ya que tú estás confiando en que la operación está realizada y ingresas al sistema de transporte en donde injustamente eres penalizado por el inspector. Luego al buscar ayuda en la ofic.. IP te encuentras con la sorpresa que hay muchas personas con el mismo problema. | Nefunguje NFC, jinak skvělá aplikace velmi doporučuji | The idea that a ticket is active only after 2 minutes since activation is a horrible design that does not combine with how trams and buses operate. I don't believe that anyone is able to uphold this arbitrary restriction. It's kinda a shame because otherwise it is a very nicely done app, just probably not really good management in the transportation department. | This is one of the most frustrating applications I have used in my entire life. | Bohužel neumí najít spojení vlakem a autobusem zároveň, takže když je ve výchozím i cílovém místě možnost vlaku i autobusu a aspoň jeden přestup, člověk musí postupně vyhledat všechny čtyři varianty. Pak už je lepší si spojení najít jinou aplikací a zde jen zaplatit. Jinak by byla aplikace super. EDIT: Konkrétní spojení vám nenapíšu, nebudu na google play zveřejňovat svou trasu. Můžu vám to napsat kamkoliv neveřejně. Ale předpokládám, že je to obecný problém, ne konkrétní. | The app is slow and full of bugs. I just purchased a monthly pass but look at this wonder, the amount was deducted from my card but no pass. Waste of time and money | Přestalo fungovat vyhledávání spojení při zadání konkretní adresy, což dosud fungovalo (aplikace našla nejbližší zastávku). Nyní se objevuje hláška ""chyba, spojení nebylo nalezeno"". Jediné, co funguje, je přesné zadání názvu nejbližší zastávky MHD. Toto je ale značně uživatelsky nepříjemné, zdržující. Navíc je nutné najít nejbližší zastávku k dané adrese ručně, skrze jiné aplikace (pokud neznáte její název). | I was logged out with no reason and when I tried to log in, my password wasn't working. I did multiple attempts, and finally reset it successfully. But couldn't log in anymore because my account was temporary blocked. It's night and my phone looses battery, how should I come home now? How long is temporary? Why can't you notify me before that my attempts are counted? | Buying tickets is easy and apparently it will remember card. Easy to activate tickets when needed. The pricing is nice and simple. Connections screen doesn't seem to find anything. Not enough English on some screens. | Dal bych 5 kdyby pri otevreni spoje na mape ukazoval take moji lokaci jak je to u seznamu | Cool | Tried to buy a month pass as cheaper than 2x72 hour passes. Photo rejected with czech message that I had to manually type into Google translate. Now I have to retake according to Czech driving licence quality which I have no idea of, just to buy a public transport pass. Whilst I'm sure this is fine for natives, useless for us tourists. Off to find somewhere selling the old paper tickets. | Tlačítko kooupit jízdenku bylo zašeděno, viděl to kontrolór, pak po 5ti minutách začalo fungovat, tak to mám za 1000, to bude snad fičúra a ne bug, díky moc 👍👍👍👍 | Note to users: Ticket inspectors are extremly aggressive. You have to activate your ticket way before you are on the tracks. There is some white line at the entry and the ticket needs to be activated there and you cant be in -2 min countdown (activation starts on minus 2 minutes). Paid 3000 czk fine at the subway entry point with bought tickets that were not activated yet because I didnt know where do I need to go. Very harsh compared to other big cities with subway with no practicality in it. | Totally ineffectively managed company. All employees (drivers, officials, controllers etc.) are always angry and unsatisfied. No clear information about travelling outside Prague and combining tickets. You just pay for nothing and get fined in the end, because ticket takes time to activate. | nejde nic | 15.6. nebylo možné koupit jízdenku za 40kc a byl jsem nucen si koupit za 50. Co mě ale vytáčí úplně nejvíc, je že si aplikace svévolně mění nastavení podsvícení displeje. Ani nerespektuje okolní světlo, nebo čas a kdykoliv mi bez varování vypálí do sítnice qrkod. Ne, prostě nebyla v nabídce. Chápu důvod, ale nechápu že nebere ohled na okolní světelné podmínky a taky proč má nedokonalost čteček provodcich a revizoru platit zákazník. | I am from Croatia and I have been in Prague last week. This is definitely the best app for public trasport. I wish that every major city have similar app. It was so smooth traveling within Prague with this app. Not just traveling but feature to buy tickets within app is awesome! I would give 10 stars if play store would support this :) big big big big big thank you guys for this app!! Keep rockin! | Funguje jak má... | 20200305: App keep failing on searching connection and buying ticket.

Highly recommended. | All bought items get added to faves automatically, cannot turn it off. Makes maintaining faves hard. | My favourite app for buying groceries and toiletries in Czechia. Easy to use and search in English. Delivery service is far more professional than most other couriers - polite and friendly. Happy to pay a premium for a greater variety of choice. Keep it up! | Always great service and great products | V poslední době aplikace po startu zůstává viset ve stavu Loading (logo s rohlíkem a nekonečný progress). Děje se to i s verzí v únoru 2024. Vždy pomůže aplikaci zavřít a znovu otevřít. | Some things in the app are slow or flickering, but pretty nice app and service overall. | super | Categories could be better. Also, sort option would be nice to see cheaper options or the highest discounts etc. it is good that there is EN option in the app | Dobrá aplikace. Běží a vyhledává rychle a relativně inteligentně. Kategorie jsou super když hledáte něco neobvyklejšího. Hodil by se filtr na ""skladem"" protože semtam vyprodané položky jsou na prvních 20 místech | Easy to use and great app. | Skvělá apka, není nic moc co vytknout. pokud rádi používáte rohlík k nákupu, tak tato apka určitě potěší | This is a great app and service - the app tells you to the closest 5 mins when the shopping will arrive. | Super aplikace, jednoduše se ovládá a můžu nakupovat i z postele. | App crashes all the time saying I am not connected to the internet, while I obviously am. | poměrně nepřehledné, nejde rychlém filtrovat podle ceny... reklama slíbí dovezeme dnes do 20:00 a před platbou máte na výběr pouzee termíny na následující den... | Terrible navigation! Use the windows browser instead | Yay, it's in English now. App works perfectly fine and is easy to use | Vazim si vsech, kteri se neboji, v dnesni dobe podnikaji a delaji to velmi dobre. Navic jsou i solidarni a v dobe po tornadu na Jizni Morave rozvazeli potrebnym jidlo i piti. Drobne chybky se vloudi, ale resi je okamzite. 100% 5 hvezd! | top | Je to velice užitečná aplikace. | Aplikace není špatná, ale má dva zásadní nedostatky: 1) nemá tmavý režim (ten bílý design večer hrozně svítí) 2) během nakupování není vidět, za kolik mám zatím nakoupeno. | they have a great selection | great, reliable and convenient. | Při používání appky mám trochu divný pocit. Horizontální scrollovani je dost přísné. Data se občas načítají pomalu. Kliky (úprava množství, přidat do košíku, odstranit zboží) nepříjemně laguji. Služba jako celek je skvělá. | Rohlík oceňuji kvůli ochotným laskavým řidičům, nemusím tahat nákupy. Mají slušný výběr bio potravin. Za výborný nápad považuji recepty se seznamem ingrediencí, které si hned můžete přidat do košíku. Také oceňuji snahu o zodpovědné chováni související s udržitelným způsobem života. | velice užitečná služba, navíc dobře zorganizovaná. | aplikace je celkem funkční a má vše dobře zobrazitelne, akorát má dostatek technických problémů. když chci něco odstranit ze svého košíku tak mi neodstraní rovnou a musím čekat, nebo někdy to vůbec neodstraní. taky při scrollovani má hodně lagu, někdy musím čekat 3-4 sekundy než to zase je v pohodě. | keeps on reloding quite often on Android phone | Now with English. Perfect! App is easy to use, they refund when products are bad or missing. In general I prefer it to supermarket, although the minimum price to deliver at home is a bit too high now. Next improvement steps would be to increase Rohlik point distribution. Great job! | Rychlý a jednoduchý nákup | excellent service, always 10/10, never disappointed | Pozor na pokladně, podvodníci. Zkontrolujte ceny zboží při check out-u. Často všímám že zboží za, například 49,- v košíku má už jinou cenu 67,- (mám screenshoty). Žádné akce nebo podmínky na nákup více kusů při tom nejsou. Ostuda 🤢 | easy to use . some time it takes longer time to load. | Great shopping app, improving continuously. | great | skvela appka, lidi prijemny, do obchodu uz nepotrebujem, ani ty ceny nejsou spatny | SMS o českém příjezdu řidiče chodí jak se jim zachce. Nabízíte organicky pěstované plodiny a doručujete je v obalech z neorganického papíru. | Scam | Jak webovky tak aplikace absolutně nesmyslně organizované. Vynucené rozřazení do pod-kategorií a zákaz řádění dle svého (celé kategorie), aby si člověk nedejbože neuvědomil, kolik co stojí, dokáže udělat z 20min nákupu 35min bojování s UI které má heslo ""anti-user design"" vytetované na čele. | Bez debat 5***** sluzba! | A handy App when you need a quick order or just putting together a shopping list. | Výborná služba. Kurýři jsou flexibilní. | Skvělá služba a hezky navržená aplikace. Skvělé je řazení podle jednotky a chytře zvolené filtry. Reaguje taky na dietní omezení jako ""keto"" ""bez lepku"" atd. Aplikace má někdy tendenci neaktualizovat ceny a prodávat zboží, které již není na skladě. Je pak nutný restart. Zboží v košíku zůstane. | Po posledním updatu se něco nepovedlo, ceny neodpovídají (akce při přidání do košíku zmizí), nebo zboží najednou není k dispozici. | it's pretty easy to find and order with. I only wish it had an option for switching languages but that's not picking. | It's getting better and better. | V nové verzi jsou fonty miniaturní a nerespektují systémové nastavení, tedy nedají se změnit. | Good, easy to use. The English version is very helpful. | The app keeps crashing on my oneplus phone. | Nebyl zadny problem natukat cely nakup. | skvělá aplikace i služba | funguje super | Unable to open it since the last update. Every time I restart data /wifi keeps repeating that ""it stopped working,"" so I have to force it off. | App just endlessly loads. It used to work before | Super eshop se spoustou vyrobku, spolehlivy rozvoz, prijemni ridici. Pro cetsi nakupy se urcite vyplati. | it wouldnt hurt to have more slots for express delivery if you pay premium. Prices are high, but nice variety. | The app is easy to navigate, even before there was an English version I was able to use the app without issues, things I want to get to are in places that make sense. | Never got SMS for rohlik point, every time I need to contact support! Switching to Košík | Vyhledávání Vám zase nefunguje! A kategorie se nikdy nenačtou. ""Jejda, něco se pokazilo..."" Jak mám u Vás proboha nakupovat? Nepřestává mne fascinovat, jak se dá něco dříve funkčního takhle zfušovat... | Vyprodane zbozi, jako pecivo, neni mozne objednat ani na nasledujici den. | Appka NEMA tmavy profil | Rohlik jako služba je skvělý ale tato aplikace je šílená a plná chyb. | Nelze doplnit objednávku i když zavoláte ihned po jejím odeslání. | App works great | Super, pouzivam casto | There's no English version and that pretty much concludes my review. | Rohlík je nejlepší! 😉 | Pretty good service. Quality of the food is overall satisfying. However it would be good to have more pick up points in Brno, as it was before. Now it seems like only delivery option is available... | Přidání kategorií do oblíbených položek je fakt strašný, absolutně nepoužitelný. Doufám že vrátíte jednoduchý seznam. | Za mě super služba, šetří mi spoustu času a ceny považuji za srovnatelné s běžným nákupem - za předpokladu, že jeden neobjíždí akce... | It crushes very often | appka funguje bez problemu, super stejne jak pres web | No English version available, seems like a good app, but without proper internationalization it's so hard for an expat to use. | Categories, search.. Loading forever and not working. Making an order is a suffering. | konečně to ma opakování nákupu, ale nejsou vidět podobné vyrobky, copiruj Košík 😆 | Po update apka nejde spustit | I just downloaded the app, and have been scrolling through to find the feature that allows the language change, cant find the slot to change to English. | Wir haben heute das erste Mal via App bestellt und sind total begeistert und zufrieden. Die Lieferung war pünktlich der Service freundlich. Die Lieferung erfolgte direkt an die Wohnungstür und alles war frisch und wurde so geliefert wie bestellt | prehledne, mnohem rychlejsi nez web, ja su spokojene | Cannot change app language, all items names in shop are inherited from device language. | Obecně delší response, dlouho načítá, někdy přidané zboží z košíku ""zmizí"", někdy mizí zboží ""pod rukama"" (vložíte do košíku a po přechodu do košíku je najednou zboží vyprodané), někdy mazání textu nereaguje na backspace . Nelze nastavit jazyk jiný než je jazyk systému - v české appce nechci mix umělého polopřekladu do AJ a češtiny, jen proto, že systém mám v jeho přirozeném jazyce 🤦🏼‍♀️ | Nejde přepnout z angličtiny do češtiny, pokud je systémový jazyk angličtina. Od poslední rozbité verze s loadovací lištou, která tu byla od začátku a nedařilo se ji dlouho (roky?) opravit, doslova 100% posun k použitelnosti. Jedna chyba která to trochu kazí: po úspěšném zaplacení přes Google Pay aplikace nijak nepotvrdí platbu. Vrátí se na obrazovku s přehledem prázdné objednávky. Poté přijde SMS, že se objednávku podařilo vytvořit, ale v aplikaci se to nijak nezobrazuje dokud ji nerestartuji. | Got improved a lot latelly. All things I need are working. I used to prefer web application, now I use this. Is there a way to change language directly in the app? | Easy and straightforward to use. Great selection of Czech and Non Czech Foods, including British Marks and Spencers. Super range of vegetarian and vegan substitute foods. Able to add notes for the order or for the delivery driver. Open the app to check on delivery status. Same day delivery. | Works well, intuitive design, fast. | Very buggy (leading to 30mins to finalise the purchase:was not responding), only one localisation, after yesterday update doesn't start. Very frustrating | Praktická aplikace s jednoduchým objednáním skoro jako na webu, jenom najít kategorii receptů je trošku složitější. | Funguje. | Apka se občas nenacte, není vidět podobné výrobky jako u Košíku, kódy slev se nedají zadat v appce | Buggy unreliable slow app | functional | thank you for the great service | quick and easy | easy.relevant.economical | Low loading, bugging app | 4 protože je stále dost co je třeba v App zlepšit ale služby rohlíku mohu vřele doporučit | Easy to use interface. Has many issues in various situations, when the app just gets stuck or doesn't show any results. It is a little bit better than the mobile version of the website in this regard, but still not great. | So far so ... excellent. Both the app and the service seem great! | Mnohem rychlejsi nacteni produktu nez na webu. Usporadani je malicko jine, coz vyzaduje chvili zvyku, ale je uzpusobeno pro mobily. Takze super. | supr sluzba, uchazejici ceny ( za usetreny cas to stoji), mili ridici a proste vseobecna spokojenost. Jen jedna malickost - chybi persistentni razeni. pri kazde zmene kategorie se to prehodi na doporucene. | Fajne | Not in English | Většinou to moc pěkně funguje. :-) | works better for me than the website. less laggy | Místy se objevují chyby s přidáním zboží, ale jinak spokojenost. | Chyba funkcionalita ktora je na webe, co je skoda (filtrovanie cez alergeny a pod super veci), aplikacia je casto zabugovana co znemoznuje pouzivanie a clovek sa musi vratit na web, jedina uzitocna funckia pre mna je sledovanie casu prichodu kuriera s nakupom. | I enjoy the app, seems what ever I need is there. | Někdy se seká/padá | using it weekly for the past 3+ years. amazing service, easy to use and if there is ever a problem woth some product, you get money back immediately | Aplikace funguje dobře a Rohlík na ni pořád pracuje a zdá se že poslouchají i připomínky. V aplikaci se da jednoduše objednat i případně reklamovat zboží z objednávky pokud je nějaký problém. v součastnosti nemám nic na vytknutí :) | Spamuje telefon, neustále se připomíná. Nepodporuje landscape mode, nepoužitelná z tabletu, škoda. | Why no English version?? | Mival jsem sluzbu rad, ale kdyz praskly ty vykoristovatelske praktiky stran kuryru, jsem Rohlikem zhnusen. | Viz článok na a2larm | Na android 12 nefunguje u mě skoro nic. Nedá se vyhledávat výrobek, vždy napíše, že nic nebylo nalezeno. Kategorie se nikdy nenačtou, adresu si nepamatuje, takže objednávám a vkládám do košíku z webu, v aplikaci jen dokončím objednávku. Nechápu, už byly minimálně 2aktualizace za dobu, kdy mám 12,ale pořád nefunguje. Odinstalaci i smazání dat jsem zkoušela, nepomohlo. .. | Chtěl jsem se podívat co mají, ale to se nedá bez registrace, tak smazané | Skvělá aplikace, přehledná, jen bych ještě ocení možnost dát kurýrovi dýško zpětně po dovezení nákupu | Can't finish my order. I can't see all the time spots like in webapp either. This app is trash 🗑️ | English man! | Po poslední aktualizaci je aplikace takřka nepoužitelná. Obsah košíku se nerefreshuje, tlačítko pro dokončení objednávky disablované. Celkově je aplikace velmi zasekaná, requesty trvají nepřiměřeně dlouho, aplikace není uzivatelsky přívětivá... Web běží bez problémů. | I saw in march 2020 that rohlik team promised that english will be implemented soon. We are nov 2021.... What can I say? Just to uninstall the app and use web ...😕 | Uz to není ta hrozná předchozí aplikace. | How can I use this app. in english? | Jejda něco se pokazilo zkuste to prosím později, nepoužitelné | Its all in Czech. Web version has English why the app don't? | English version please. | English language please! | Nedá sa nakupovať = useless. | The website is better | Appka je občs k nasrání, ceny jiné než na desktopu, půl hodiny než se syncnou s desktop verzí a pak v košíku najednou mi vyskočí, že vše už není ve slevě. Po kliknutí na nechat v košíku je bez reakce a můžu si klikat třeba do konce života. | Na desktopu mnohem lepší, tady furt nějaké malé bugy. Třeba při kliknutí na přidat do košíku se občas zase samo preklikne zpátky, jako kdyby se zboží hned z košíku zase odebralo. Taky občas nezobrazí žádné položky a musím prekliknout do jiného pohledu a zpátky, abych udělal refresh. Jako jedna z mála aplikaci se mi na mobilu seká při scrollovani. | Poslední dobou je appka k ničemu. Nedovolí mi to jít k objednávce a vždy skončí s chybou. Ukazuje neexistující volná okna na objednávku, která už nejsou podle webu volná. Dost často mi to ukazuje zboží, které už není skladem, jen ho nejde přidat do košíku. Aktualizuje data dlouhé minuty. A v kategoriích nelze nijak filtrovat. | Please please offer English, otherwise it's great. Thanks | The app gets stuck loading the pictures, by the time I finished my shopping some of the products were no longer available. Then the payment gateway got stuck and my chosen time of delivery was no longer available. Waste of time | An English version would be great. | V aplikaci se stále nedá efektivně filtrovat. A načítání aktuálních dat trvá i na rychlém připojení někdy i desítky sekund. Stále je tak lepší používat web než aplikaci. Škoda, protože po stránce vzhledu je aplikace zvládnutá skvěle. | English review below. Program je průměrný. Má to mnoho nedostatků. První je ten, že do teď nemůžu platit zapamatovanou kartou. Něco se mu nelíbí a basta, žádná konkrétní chybová hláška. Tu kartu musím zadávat znovu při každém nákupu! Velice se mi nelíbí, že program mi leze sám do kalendáře a zapisuje čas doručení bez mého svolení! EN: App's got a lot of flaws. Doesn't remember my card details and gives me vague error messages every time. Makes notes in Google calendar without my permission!! | Nakupuji zde přes rok, super výběr a přístup k zákazníkům, ale teď jsem objevil košík a ceny jsou za stejné zboží oproti košíku o dost vyšší, průměrně vyjde můj běžný nákup 1.5x dráž což je docela dost. | Opakovany samovolny crash aplikace behem nakupu. Pri poslednim crashi dokonce aplikace ztratila nejenom ma predtim ulozena data (adresa, telefon...), ale i nakup ktery jsem behem cele obedni prestavky daval dokupy. Ztrata casu, ktereho i tak nemam nazbyt. Odinstaloval jsem a neplanuji uz v budoucnu pouzivat. | I like very much the service Rohlik provides and the premium products they offer. The app is very good, but doesn't support English. Similar apps do supprt English (e.g. Tesco's) and funny enough so does Rohlik's website. Would rate it 5 stars if they add English. | Nákup som v appke zaplatil, peniaze mi v banke zablokovali, appka mi nákup potvrdila, ale nákup neprišiel. Po sťažnosti som sa dozvedel že oni moju (už zaplatenú) objednávku neevidujú a že ja som na vine, že som ""rýchlo klikal"". Presviedčali ma, že objednávku nemajú. Na otázku, prečo mi potom na karte zablokovali presnú sumu za nákup, keď o tom nevedia, som nedostal odpoveď. Musel som si objednať ešte raz a tentoraz zaplatiť aj dopravu (ktorú mi refundovali ako kredit). Plus to vyšlo drahšie... | Great app, not in English. | V poslední době výpadky. | Skoro vždy aj pri vynikajúcom pripojení, keď chcem nakupovať cez appku, ""sťahujeme čerstvá dáta"" trvá aj niekoľko minút. Je to hrozne otravné, lebo sa pri tom mení ponuka, hlavne v zachráň jedlo sekcii. Úplne to demotivuje používať aplikácií a keď je počítač ďaleko, je to dosť otravné | No English! | Nepoužitelná aplikace i po přeinstalaci zobrazuje pořád ""Stahování nových dat"" a neumožňuje nic vložit do košíku. | Nejde se přihlásit přes Facebook. Při každém pokusu o přihlášení se zobrazí zpráva, že aplikace nemá přístup k emailu. V nastavení facbook aplikací však přístup má a navíc se nezobrazí ani možnost přihlášení. | Still not translated to English. Very simple feature to develop. WTH 🤷‍♂️ | Nova aplikace je neprehledna. | Nefunguje přihlášení | S aplikací jsem byla velmi spokojená. Po nedávném redesignu ovšem musím konstatovat, že změna je k horšímu. Ikony jsou větší, čili je třeba víc skrolovat. Víc mi ovšem vadí haprující funkce vyhledávání, napíšu ""máslo"", najde mi máslo, bez diakritiky najde kromě másla i maso. Maso již nenabízí kategorii ""farmářské"", čili se musím proklikat celou nabídkou masa a všímat si ikonek u každé položky. Možnost napsat zpětnou vazbu po odeslání objednávky nefunguje vůbec. | The only food e-shop that adapted to huge demand spike due to coronavirus. The only modern food e-shop in Czech Republic I know of. | Nefunguje. Je úplně jedno, zda se snažím přihlásit přes e-mail, nebo Facebook, přes mobilní data, nebo Wi-Fi. Ještě nikdy se mi nepodařilo do té aplikace přihlásit. Pochopitelně mám aktuální jak verzi aplikace, tak Android 10, tak i ostatní aplikace, omezený běh na pozadí ostatních aplikací a procesů, tak i normální telefon (Samsung Galaxy S10 5G). Odinstalace , nic jiného. | Nový redesign je nádherný. Radost používat <3 | Přehledný, dobrý výběr, akce a možnost přiobjednat zboží - velmi užitečný e-shop. | Love the app and the website, however would be nice to have an English version of both (not a google translator version). Keep up the good work and thank you for the support during these quarantine times | Super obchod a aplikace. Neslo by k produktum pridat moznost komentaru nebo feedbacku? Lepe by se ukazalo, ktere produkty jsou kvalitni a ktere mene. Prosim bylo by mozne spravne aktualizovat zemi puvodu podle disponibilniho zbozi? Je to dulezity parametr, podle ktereho nakupuji. Hrozny neznamo zda z Italie, Chile nebo Indie me prekvapily. | Please add English!! Impossible to log in, terrible. | Nedaří se mi přihlásit a na webu to jde | Nepodařilo se připojit k serveru - využiji konkurenci, děkuji. | Last update broke it. It would be nice if the app would tell that it is intentionally offline. | Ted jsem to stahla a vubec to nefunguje.. | Přestala fungovat apka | Rohlík mám rád, ale nefunguje mi dobře vyhledávání. Napsal jsem např. ""Červená"" a appka nevyhledala ani papriku, ani cibuli. Musel jsem hledat ručně. | Vse by bylo super, ale.... obcas se ztraceji z kosiku predpripravene veci a odmazani tzv. oblibenych polozek ve vetsim poctu je tragicke. | Awesome app, could use English though | User friendly, intuitive and fast. Like it a lot. Just noticed one small thing--it was suggesting my favorite things to buy in the last step but when I added them they weren't available or were sold out. Thank you for a great app and making my life so much easier🙌 | Neustale me nuti vyplnovat udaje ke karte. Pokud necham zatrzene tlacitko Zaplatit zapamatovanou kartou, oznami mi aplikace chybu pri pokusu o provedeni platby. Jakmile tlacitko odskrtnu a pokusim se platbu provest znovu, objevi se obrazovka, ktera uz chce jen zadani CV2 kodu, po nemz platba uspesne projde. | Not bad, but not great either. It's buggy (unable to sign in through Facebook sometimes, telling me the courier will check my age when I click on Pay button, non working search at times...). Design could be nicer too. Košík app is way better. | 👍 | super | Nakupování přes aplikaci je pohodlnější a rychlejší než přes počítač. Doporučuji | Chybí mi v košíku a následně před dokončením objednávky řazení produktů dle kategorie | I've been using the app for about 3 month. The app has been improved over the time. It is quick and responsive, searching is fast. Everything works. | Apka je super, ale neustále žebrání o ohodnocení aplikace i když jsem ji již jednou hodnotil si vysloužilo tuto krásnou jednu hvězdičku. :) Zde tedy je, doufám že žebrání přestane. | Skvělé, úžasné nemám slov. | Nadále nejlepší v ČR, jen zmizel ""popis produktu"". | No progress bar visible during search and when adding products. App seems like it's laging, no matter on speed of data access (it behaves same on the wi-fi or 4G). I prefer shopping on the desktop website than on the mobile app. | Oproti webu hrozný. Použitelný, ale hrozný. | Opakované problémy s dodávkou, mizerná komunikace, skrývání problémů do poslední chvíle. Nemůžete se spolehnout na žádnou objednávku, v lepším případě přijde aspoň o hodinu po termínu, nebo vůbec. Nikam se nedovoláte, nikdo nic neřekne. | Jednoduche, rychle, funkční! | Quick and easy. | Perfect 👌 | No option to return back to the category after you check details of an article. Kind regards, Olga | Very practical, clean interface. Wish it was available in English but between my broken Czech and the fact EVERYTHING has pictures , its very doable. Also Rohlik chef is the greatest thing ever, love the dishes, love the fact every ingredient is listed right there. Makes picking dishes to cook a breeze! | Aplikace stale vyzyva k hodnoceni aplikace po kazdem nakupu. Nyni 1/12 spatne graficke rozhrani na samsung s7 galaxy, nejsou videt tlacitka ve spodni liste. | Přehledná aplikace, vse v pořádku | Much improved over earlier version. | Aplikace je přehledná a praktická pro rychlý nákup. | Working very well. The payment is exceptionally easy and comfortable. | Původně jsem dal 5 hvězdiček, ale už mi leze na nervy, že se po každém nákupu ptají jestli je chci ohodnotit a musím odklikavat debilni možnost Možná později. | Vyrazne vylepsena. Super. Ale furt po me chce, abych ji hodnotil, kdyz koukam, ze uz je hodnocena, tak dam treba hvezdicku dolu :P | Funguje výborně, dělá přesně to, co má - samozřejmě mírně méně přehledné než web, ale to je cena za malý displej. | Přehledná a snadno použitelná aplikace. | Funguje tak jak má! | Vyprodaný produkt občas v jiné kategorii vypadá jako dostupný a do košíku lze přidat. Občas dlouhé načítání při startu aplikace a při potvrzení objednávky. Než stihnu přidat do košíku vše co potřebuji vždy se něco vyprodá a musím vybírat alternativu. | Easy to use and updated live with the availability of products.

Když se snažím registrovat píše, že email existuje. Obnova hesla ale píše, že se email nepodařilo obnovit | Aplikace sama o sobě je dobrá, ale největší negativum je informace ""aplikaci jsme vylepšili, pro její správné fungování je nutné se odhlásit a opět přihlásit."" Když přijdu na prodejnu, potřebuji nakupovat a né hledat přihlašovací údaje (které stejně nevím, mám je doma) tak že aplikaci zase vypnu a přes aplikaci Stocard si musím vzít přístroj ScanGo. Tak že aplikace díky tomuhle kompletně k ničemu. Žádná jiná aplikace po aktualizaci opětovné přihlášení nepotřebuje, tak proč tato? Bylo by fajn tohle opravit, do té doby je aplikace nepoužitelná a proto i jedna hvězda. | Dobrá aplikace, skvělá je možnost využívat scan and go | Hi. The application stop working after the last update. So now when I run the app it closes automatically. I tried reinstall it, restart my phone but nothing helps. | Sponzoruje terorismus | perfect useful | Skenování produktů telefonem je neuvěřitelně svižné. V porovnání s tesco aplikací je tohle úplně jinde. Výtky: Není mi vůbec jasné, jak sdílet nákupní seznam tak, aby ho další člen domácnosti mohl doplnit nebo upravit, přitom by to jít mělo. Sdílením odkazu to nejde. Dtb položek a jejich ceny jsou super, ale abych se podíval na detail musim nejdřív přidat položku na seznam. Globus bonus klub je trochu k ničemu. Málo relevantních kuponů a hlavně na peněžní bonusy musím mít fyz.kartu? Jako vážně? | Funguje, ale obcas ztratí registraci karty a musí se znova zaregistrovat - což samozřejmě zjistíte když zrovna chcete v obchodě nakupovat. | Aplikaci ráda používám, je super, ale štve mě, že mě čas od času úplně odhlásí, což zjistím při jejím spuštění při vstupu do prodejny, a pak se musím pracně přihlašovat (naskenovat kartu, zadat kód). Proč? Také se mi často stává, že nejde přidat zboží - po naskenování kódu visí obrazovka v modu ""Přidávám produkt do košíku"", zasekne se tam, musím se vrátit a znovu skenovat, nebo když si nevšimnu, zboží se nepřidá. | Při skenování zboží mi restartuje telefon. Dřív to fungovalo ok. Mám Pixel 4. | Ok ale nejdou uplatnit kupony. A to že vždy když zapinam aplikaci a jsem v jiném globusu musím změnit prodejnu nenacte si ji to samo neni příjemné. | Aplikace už je lepší, nepadá. Není však přehledná. Jsou zde nesmyslné kupóny na věci, které nekupuji. | Troufnu si říct že je to nejlepsi appka od obchodu v ČR, líbí se mi účtenky, s&g v telefonu, nákupní seznam, informace o vytíženosti atd... | User friendly app for shoping in Globus store. | Really good app - you can see also contents of your goods, great! And some cooking recipes 👌 | Kupóny by se měly uplaťňovat automaticky nebo poloautomaticky (upozornit těsně před placením). Dnes jsem musel celý nákup zrušit a všechno naskenovat znovu, protože protože po stisknutí zaplatit na pokladně už nejde kupon uplatnit ani se vrátit zpět. Pak mně volali, že jim tam visí nezaplacený nákup. | Ok. | 👍👍👍 | The application is good. However today I was told that my card was blocked. How is that possible I don't know, supposedly something regarding GDPR. The application should notify the user if the card is blocked! | Do you have English version? | Aplikace pokaždé vyžaduje přihlášení, což by nebyl problém kdyby prohlášení netrvalo 5 min na 10. pokus Radši otevřu web a appku používat nebudu | Add English and Dark mode support. | App does not work well, need to login every time even when switch between screens. Uninstalled. | Scanování nákupu přímo v aplikaci zní jako skvělý nápad. Dost to ale potom pokazí fakt, že když přijedete k pokladně, dočtete se, že nemůžete z nějakého záhadného důvodu platit stravenkovou kartou a scanovali jste celý vozík zbytečně. Potom stejným způsobem narazíte ještě i vedle u samoobslužné pokladny a musíte jít zboží skládat na pás k obsluze... A když se pak v aplikaci chcete podívat na účtenku, přečtěte si, že se objeví během 24h! Nežijeme ve 21. století? Je tady co dohánět. | Like that I can see my list ofy regular shopping and see the current prices 😊 | Aplikace velice usnadňuje rodinné nákupy, neboť je možné mít ji staženou na více zařízeních, poté může každý člen domácnosti přidávat do nákupního seznamu potřebné zboží. Předností aplikace je získaný přehled o budoucí ceně nákupu. Zároveň s aplikací odpadá potřeba stálého nošení Globus karty, protože kód karty je také přístupný v této úžasné aplikaci. Sečteno podtrženo aplikaci Můj Globus hodnotím nejvyšším počtem hvězdiček. | skenování probíhá rychle, ale pak musíte několik vteřin čekat, až se zobrazí položka v košíku. je nutné tak čekat před naskenováním další položky. | Nedá sa zaregistrovať, nefunkčná appka EDIT: Číslo karty nemám, pretože nie som zaregistrovaný | User Friendly App | Zase o krok napřed. Aplikace je přehledná, funkční a obsahově plně dostačující pro rychlí nákup. Nové aktualizace opět daly aplikaci náskok. Sakra dobrá práce! | Funguje jak má | V nové verzi funguje skenování kódů OK. Spokojenost | Posledni aktualizace velky spatny. Pomaly start shoppingu (pres pul minuty) pomaly pridavani do kosiku, strasne zere baterku. Dokud se to nefixne, tak budu muset asi pouzivat skenner nebo co | Funguje naprosto dokonale. Všechno na jednom místě, jak akční letáky, tak klubové slevy a nákupní seznamy. Dá se použít i jako scan & go čtečka, místo terminálu v prodejně, což je úplně skvělé. | Skvělé! Někdo se aspoň snaží. Lepší než nic. Ale jako zásadní nedostatek mi přijde, že se zboží nedá prohlížet podle kategorií. Proč musím každé zboží vyhledávat zvlášť? Chci přidat konkrétní utěrky, samozřejmě, že neznám jejich přesný nazev, vyhledám ""utěrky"" je jich tam asi 100 a obrázek má tak 20%. Jak je mám najít? To nemluvím o tom, že když si chci zboží objednat a vyzvednout, musím přes web. V appce tato možnost není. Ty dvě hvězdičky jsou za snahu, další funkce jsou skvělé. | Jdu do Globus udělat nákup s aplikací a pak se u poklady dozvím že je tam chyba a musím si to celý znovu u pokladny načíst. | No English version! | Know is more client friendly | Skvělá aplikace. Seznam produktů nabízených obchodem, vlastní nákupní seznam, scan&go servis včetně in-app kódu fyzické karty. Do obchodu stačí přijít pouze s telefonem. Vše funkční. Ocenil bych možnost aktuálního inventáře produktů (dostupnost v daném obchodě) v seznamu produktů s mapkou, kde produkt v obchodě najdu. Současně nerozumím jak si odečtu z nákupu částku z věrnostního programu. | I have to accept spam in order to register | Aplikace fungovala skvěle. Pak ale začala padat vždy ihned při zapnutí. Nainstaloval jsem znovu a stále to samé. Telefon LG V30 9.0 Doufám že to vývojáři opraví protože jinak to byla dobrá aplikace. | Proč musím souhlasit s letáky do schránky při tvorbě online účtu? Navíc souhlas neodpovídá GDPR | Paráda. Použil jsem scan&go ve vánoční špičce. Konečně nemusím začít nákup načtením kódu před vchodem. Byl trochu problém při hledání aplikace v play store. I při zadání ""globus Česko"" byla první zobrazována německá verze. | Scan And go je trochu pomalejší. Cca 2s než se položka přidá na seznam. | Velice dobrá aplikace, je vidět, že do vývoje bylo hodně investováno. Reaguje i na potřeby zákazníka, to je jedině dobře, dnes je běžné napsat aplikaci a dál se o ní nestarat. Pár nedostatků je. Na starších telefonech, je problém s ostřením. Chybí multi language. Ale jinak nic hroznýho. Funguje suprově i na telefonu za 1000kč. | Excelent! :) | Super aplikace, používám ji raději, než skener. Kupóny jsou konečně online a nákupní seznam taky. Jedna hvězdička dolů za chybějící tap to focus. Občas se foťák rozostří a pak už nejde nic naskenovat. Jinak dobrá práce. Přidal bych ještě historii nákupů a možnost exportu. | Funguje, spolehlivá, snad i bezpečná. | Excellent | Ze začátku byla aplikace perfektní. Postupem času ale začala dost blbnout. Občasné nekonečné načítaní Scan&Go a při přidávání položek do košíku, ale to spíš přisuzuji k pomalé veřejné WiFi při rušných hodinách (data lze využít podle nálady aplikace, uvnitř budovy v Ostravě je LTE signál horší). Občasná neschopnost načíst položku do košíku – seknutá kamera, pomáhá jen restart aplikace (jiné aplikace používající fotoaparát jedou bez problémů). Bohužel už této aplikaci nevěřím. | Rychlé a snadné. | aplikace perfektní jen neustálá synchronizace při manipulaci s nákupním seznamem je frustrující. | Super appka | there is no language settings. there are so many people that speak english in your country. try practicing to put english language any of your applications. | Účel plní výborně, UI s UX jsou vesměs taky ok.  K tomu UX mám ale výtku u nákupního seznamu: Jakákoli změna - za/odškrtnutí nebo smazání položky - se zdá být synchronizována separátně, takže po každé akci uživatel čeká a nemůže dále pracovat. Vzhledem k delším prodlevám v komunikaci to není vůbec pohodlné.  Příklad:  Chci obnovit položky z minulého nákupu na další nákup tak, že je jen odškrtnu a ty ostatní nepotřebné smažu. U každé odškrtnuté položky musím čekat na sync, což u jedné či dvou není problém, ale u seznamu s 5+ položkami to začíná být značně otravné.  Co jsem pozoroval synchronizaci změn na dvou zařízeních, tak změny z jednoho zařízení se na druhém projevily jen při pull-down refreshi, ne při těchto dílčích změnách. Z toho to chápu tak, že tyto synchronizace jen posílají lokální změny a nepřijímají nový celkový stav. Proč tedy u nákupního seznamu neprovádět synchronizaci na pozadí anebo hromadně (vytvoří se fronta akcí, která se třeba 2 vteřiny po poslední akci odešle a vyprázdní)? | az na ty nahodne kontroly, ktere vas poslou na konec fronty | Vynikajici. Rychla a zatim i bezchybna. | Za mě super aplikace, funguje rychle a nakupování je díky tomu ještě rychlejší a pohodlnější. Jen malé poznámky - v aplikaci mi nejde zobrazit akční nabídka na další týden, což je škoda vzhledem k tomu, že bych si například rád ve středu večer naplánoval nákup avšak v aplikaci je stále pouze stará nabídka a tak musím plánovat až ve čtvrtek ráno. Dále zobrazená karta na telefonu se těžce načítá do platebního automatu, ale nakonec se povedlo. Takže za mě super 😉 | aplikace běžně ztrácí přihlašovací údaje, nutné se neustále dokola přihlašovat, což považuji za otravné. dále má aplikace velké problémy s vyhledáváním, položky lze najít tak, že začnete psát název, ale nesmíte kliknout na lupu nebo zmáčknout enter na klávesnici, jen vyčkat na seznam položek, pokud kliknete, zobrazí pouze hlášku, že daná položka nebyla nalezena. jinak funguje celkem uspokojivě. v aplikaci by se hodilo možnost odeslat připomínku. | Super aplikace, baví mě jednoduché přidávání produktů do seznamu z akčních letáku, takže na nic v obchodě nezapomenu. Pochvala za nové Scan&Go! Je to naprostá bomba, na mém Samsungu A5 skenuji vše jak divý :) | Super! Aktuálně funguje jak má a rozhodně usnadňuje nákup. Jen tak dál 👍 | Nefunguje ověření po naskenování Globus karty - nelze kliknout na SMS ani email ověření . Appka tedy není funkční , škoda!:) | No, prostředí hezké, jednoduché intuitivní. Do appky se přihlásíte pouhým naskenováním zákaznické karty, to bylo fajn. Bohužel některé kódy jsou tak malé, že jsou nablízko pro foťák rozmazané a na dálku už není schopen rozlišit čáry. Když už appka neumí pracovat s ostřením, tak bych očekával alespoň manuální zadávání kódu. | Vyzkoušel jsem - aplikace jako taková funguje, ale: 1) ani obsluha v informacích netuší k čemu je QR kód na zemi u vchodu, v menu jsem nenašel jak sejmout kód 2) některé komodity (čaj s lesklým  obalem) nejdou sejmout, po nahlášení bych čekal, že obsluha přidá ke zboží vytištěný čitelnější kód 3) pokud zboží nešlo naskenovat, obsluha před pokladnou dost váhala, co s tím, bohužel nejde nijak přidat do seznamu v aplikaci. 4) zboží z letáku, které si přidám do seznamu, není fyzicky na prodejně - to by snad šlo vypsat v aplikaci, ať to zbytečně nehledám. Jinak dobrý počin, i když nákup s klasickou čtečkou je rychlejší a nemusím se bát, že mi telefon někdo vyrazí z ruky.","{""1"":1044,""2"":230,""3"":351,""4"":1859,""5"":8285}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Globus ČR, v.o.s.","Globus+%C4%8CR,+v.o.s.","aplikace@globus.cz","http://mujglobus.cz",,"https://globusbonus.cz","Globus+%C4%8CR,+v.o.s.","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KGl58AGO6fDp0LmoCBd-T3MPxp3v8-v57aGDmjuuiRvUdzOv60UOhaFyyvWnoTd9PWM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vxu733kuAvghE8tvRcYSECp2gFE-bcCzcQF-voJRgFGq_8KiVZKLMkPQ2BBaPnUkxPw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sTju2rfKoZIkvoDB1i5-_vUc5OMJwx79qypLUpX_j1RvNtHiW5z6KTagoWQqfbIug40"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cptYz3lTZEt_fcVeHIJRwFUBQ5UFo_B-zzEBc48vhRfesJoiT2ZnIn6lAsWi1V8MVpk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N9arboxL8tunYImZ91AlQH8s6gTAjfBhv_jAKWhplHpFVeoY68C9YzMdBFMRD10FUw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1ZREPPntTA545Mf1uJppl8WiSQdX2zvzkUax_bqsPIaobN6FUzy9vAfNjCEDZDMI8Q8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IjQ8VIJco1ZhUZkxdJNOo7nfag3rgj1w85pudNIUOcncXFjf6Frhpd638Hk55TZXDTs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L3tgJPr6yIDiKxduP1ojgHyahLMOlauxYQUtcNGClVHThxIfUOwlBP9gcQDZzBJUuA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UX2yRjBY4qtoUl02AyxM1EUuRGdBgp9GR5mNjGEEM1NYs0fITPRzghZd8HZQ28eZzA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dYwNOpiH_MLwRzC7bRJ_EXrMkDQ1L0dB9afyu4OdOUeiGoacuBTdeZwY3Z4GjTGcS84""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-RLhyvx9Qs?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vxu733kuAvghE8tvRcYSECp2gFE-bcCzcQF-voJRgFGq_8KiVZKLMkPQ2BBaPnUkxPw",,"PEGI 3",,false,"Nov 13, 2018",1710150055000,"1.9.27","V nové verzi 1.9.27 naleznete: <br>- novou podobu otevíracích hodin v detailu pobočky<br>- mnoho různých úprav pro hladkých chod aplikace","[""Hi.

Only can watch so much with the ads and then they ask you to hand over a ridiculous amount of money | Please create a monthly or yearly subscription, otherwise this is too expensive to continue watching. You will loose a lot of people ShortTV Limited, unless you do this. | It provides good movies but the bad part is , the app is so expensive and it's only browse 1 minute. Per episode. The worse app ever. They must upgrade their standards in terms of time because 1 minute is not right at least 10 minutes or 15. Then they have to reduce the price UpTo affordable | Doesn't work at all | Great story better and nice to watch | I paid 280 pesos for the coin, it was deducted in my gcash account, but when I open the apps the coin is still 0. My 500 coins which I paid did not exist!!! Scammer!! I have proof that I paid for that coin!! | This app has many glitches. It does not allow you to turn off auto play even after you free went into your settings and turned it off. It also does not allow you to receive all 5 free plays using the ad option. I've also found that buying coins is a waste as it runs through your coins without showing how much each episode is beforehand. This app is EXTREMELY expensive and a RIPOFF!😒😤 | Worst app ever | They paying more money for 2 3 episodes wbich is of 1 or 2 min. Disappointed. It charges for episodes not for days.. | It's nice the short movie but no search bar I'm sad 😔 | It's boring | money vaccum | The stories are cute, however the app glitches all the time. Will not let you do daily check ins. I can get some but not all. This is the only way to watch the shorts without paying an arm and a leg. | I made a purchase but didnt give my coin how pathetic you are your just notging but a Scammer!!!! | Honestly? You don't even get enough free episodes at the beginning to even get invested into a story to put money toward more. Episodes were a minute and a half, when I needed more coins after like 3 episodes, it wanted 68 for an episode. Doesn't seem like the math is mathing there. At least Dreame lets you get pulled into a story before it throws a high price out there. That's what I would compare this to. I don't mind paying for a good story, but I don't even know if it's a good story yet. | As moet of the reviews have stated, its just too expensive. The cost for a single minute long episode is ridiculous. | Great storylines, but not worth the hassle. Never finished watching the story that I came to the app for. 5 ads per day, an ad after every video is ridiculous...you get no where if you're not willing to pay for coins. I paid for 1000 coins and it was gone in like 15 min. | I would have given a zero stars if there was an option ,too many adds plus can't watch anything after 2-3 episodes because then you have to pay,do not recommend | I paid for coins got so far in the show. Then just reset to the beginning to try to make me pay again. Not worth at all. | They added more ADS for views. But they're daily, so you can watch more everyday like 8 more and if you watch ads în the spp you get more bounus | good experience | Not well written scripts. It's a joke to even watch it. So disappointed that I had spend money and not even worth watch. Now I have to uninstall the app. | this app sucks | I want my hitv app back pleaseee | Hi I love this app sooo much but you all must be wondering why did I rate it a four, well I can only watch 5 a day with ads and it used to be 10 and it's super expensive so please try to change your prices and if you can't can you guys at least change it back to 10 with ads. Thank you for reading this and pls responde back, thank you. | Not worth getting involved with | All the reward points are getting liquidated after 3days but in description it mentioned as 10days more over some times the app is not opening and getting blanc screen and not making to watch except in morning or in the evening some times getting error even with good network connection | This is a cool app the reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the shorts cost way too many coins based off of the prices to buy the coins. One series each episode costs 68 coins inorder to buy enough coins to watch the entire thing it would cost 100 dollars | It interrupts my apps dislike | 0/10 absolutely do not recommend No app has ever irritated me so much that I actually opened the app store to leave a negative review before, the stories are fine but the 60 seconds of the video before 90 second ads or the literal hundreds of push notifications per day. This app can suck a whole bag of eggplant emojis | Really wanted to watch it the adds for one of the shorts on Instagram looked interesting but it only gives you 5 free episodes which isn't worth it | It's fun. | The little stories are great, wish the clips, could be a little longer. I check in everyday, when i can, look forward to the stories.ive given it less stars, because they use to give you 15 chances to unlock more episodes watching ads, They have shorten it to 5, contemplating Deleting the app.🔥 | Love the stories on the app. But after I completed Trapped in Affection some episodes are not playing. It's frustrating because I had to watch all the adds and spent some of my money. For the amount you have to spend on coins it should unlock more than 3 or 4 episodes. | This is a bad app | Bad | Scam scam scam. Reviews don't lie .. it cost me over 75 dollars to finish one story. You only get 5 free add watches a day. Wanted to see exactly what it would cost purchasing coins to view one whole story. 75+ B rate acting at best. Cheaply filmed stories. The stories are fun but in comparison to other streaming apps this is absolutely egregiously overpriced. You can download any other streaming app and literally only pay 10 to $15 a month at most to watch . No one can afford this. | The app wants you to pay for episodes | Good story line but very poor minute and have to still pay while still watching with data. This is absolutely nonsense | Bc it won't let me watch it for free😭😭😭🥺 | It makes you pay to use the app and watch the videos. It only let's you watch free with adds for 5 episodes and then you have to pay $10.00 to keep watching. Total rip off | Disgusting | like the story line | This app is like a parking meter. Keep inserting the coins. Getting spoon-fed miniscule scenes with poor acting. I can not imagine the final cost to watch the entire series. This makes movie theatres look inexpensive. No thanks. I am uninstalling this app and pray that this marketing ploy is a short-lived fad !! | amazing app tho the episodes are too short. | enjoying these beautiful stories. | very nice the content,but it can't play the vedio with out coins,😭😭😭 | very good & excellent | love them | Very good stories... impressive | I love to stories 💕 but I hate all the adds and the price for coins | Giving a good stories and nice dramas to watch | good apps for watch short tv but please make it easy for watching more episode. | good story | Great experience... Thank u | 👌❤️‍🔥🤗💯 | I love it | can't buy using mpesa and too many ads | I love the stories ❤️ | I cannot get the search option | love the app | Super exciting every episode | I love it | good drama shorts. love it | Am so disappointed..I got glued to one of the stories so I purchased twice in raw to open more episodes and now they locked again so if I want to continue watching where I stopped I have to purchase the same episodes I've already paid and opened..a joke 😥 | please can only watch 3 episode's a day we want it for free | spendy | சூப்பர் | Exceptional good and users friendly | love it | very entertaining | I love it. It's very good, but I hate how they make us watch It. Add for every single episode and you only get 5 ADS. And then you have to pay for it. It makes me mad because some people don't have money to spend on it. | Frist This app is a Fake | I enjoy the stories. have to watch aides to read free but that's okay. | Super cool stuff and highly entertaining and excellent quality. | nice to watch | its a good movie to watch | High quality | love this app🥰 | The storylines are great. Having to pay for every episode is a rip-off scam. It's a disgusting practice. If you decide to charge a fee, at least charge in bulk. Not every episode when there are over 20 episode. | Awesome | I have been watching this but they teach us a lot of thing children should watch this app its interesting | I ❤️ it... keep laughing and wanting more | it is a nice app but too expensive | love it | THEY should have ways to earn coins! | I love it | nice storys | I like the movies, but the prices are insane. It's $9.99 for 19 1-minute long episodes. To see the whole movie that I've been watching (90 episodes), it would cost $50, which is insane. I was paying $4.99 for Paramount Plus and Peacock, which have tons of options for shows and movies. I'm going to try to finish watching the movie the free way, but after every minute, I have to watch a 30-second ad. You can only watch 5 episodes per day if you do it the free way. I'm going to uninstall this app. | awesome storylines | Nice story | stories are a little bit different | Have only had for a few hours, and with all the issues and bad ""pay per video segment"" polices as well as purchasing more coins. This is one of the worst services for mandarin Chinese short film drama. | why do we have to pay 😭 because I have to pay you give me a five 🤩 | very good and nice story | the ending is not good it is short i strongly suggest for better please have a happy ending..tnx and please the lead character must have strong personality and not only the kontrabida always win especially the male lead not always his hurting the female lead the fenale lead must win always or have a solution always if the bad character do bad things. the the female lead | jempol deh | Good stories although you lose more money than you came in with | love the stories | the movie are nice and very interesting | Wow love this short drama movies... | bagus film2nya | the movies are interesting and entertaining too worth the while | I just started watching one of this shows I was by episode 15 but now I'm on 5 again and they a charging me to watch these episodes all over again even when I already paid for it. Scam. | really I'm enjoying this short TV apps | Too stretched till it got winding and boring. I was watching I Can Hear You and spent some money just to keep watching a long and winding story. It should be Long Tv instead of Short Tv because there are overwhelming number of episodes and they cost too much. Gave up on the series instead. | Very nice app actually | Horrible | really great watching the short film. | i think the app should have a mermaid story | I love every novel you had | plz unlock the chapters plz I request you to plz ❤️ plz plz 🥺😭 | I love it!! | should be able to watch more without having to get coins | Amazed | love it | too Much Aid But Good | Good app | 👍👍👍👍😍 | It's a good concept but every time I get going through episodes my coins mysteriously dissappear not only that but I'll watch a couple episodes then it'll tell me that I need to unlock the previous episode when I already have, but then when I go out of it and back in it shows that I haven't watched those episodes and wants me to pay again and resets my coins. Please fix this | need more free ads | I really enjoyed every bit of it. Thank you. | If I could leave 0 stars I would. You shouldn't have to pay over $30 for 1 ""short"" series. Ridiculous. | love it | Paid 25 with my facbook linked would keep signing me out so I used the guest account it kept signing me into paid another 10 hot the coins paid another 25 got zero coins ap constantly glitches waste of time money an you can't even fish a story 60 dollars in what a rip off | It good app but you need to pay money But don't worry you watch by watching ads😉 | Worst app don't fall for it, they ll ask you money and the movies we can't see what we can watch is only ads | Enjoyable,well made and good acting. Recently I asked re pricing and was pleased with the quick response and willingness to work with the customer. But then after giving 5 stars shortTv I have to pay 2 more NZD 18.99 and so many ads. I am so sorry but shortTv your destroying the enjoyablilty of the stories. | excellent series | Constantly logging me out while I'm watching and takes forever to load even with wifi. It's so glitchy | it good but the money day are paying is too much | alot of the stories really draw you in! | I logged in using Facebook as well as Google it still shows as visitor | Really disappointed. Watched all the ads which take forever only not to have the rewards granted & also the check in bonus not to work. Only had it for 2 days!!!! | good story | I paid $26 for coins and could not get a refund because it logged me out after it took my money and I lost all of it. Email them for a refund and didn't hear anything. | Not the greatest. Bought roughly 800 coins and opened 2 episodes. Don't use this app | love it | like this is good | I like all the little stories I have seen and the ones sometimes I wish that I can be one of them women | fair to middle acting not great but my teen daughter love it | wow this is the best app | am out of words not exaggerating but it's super awesome | I hate that I need to get coins just to watch a 1 minute clip. | I think we shouldn't have to pay so much money to watch the episodes. We should be allowed more free ones pure month. Cheaper budles/packs as well. But e joy the shorts. Just too short. Lol | love the stories | i love it | So many bugs. The videos I've already watched are now saying I have to pay to watch to moved forward. And the earning coins is a joke. They disappear as soon as you earn enough to watch another video. It's like they are trying to FORCE you to spend real money to even watch their episodes. This whole app is a joke. | love the stories linees | I don't like the ending because there is no closure | nice movie | cool stories told in a fun way | amazing app I love the story lines | Of 1 | great | nice short story here | good | I so love this app!!!but I just wish for cheaper coin packages | very good | very nice series | One of the best app ever.... if not the best . | the story is very good | so nice | Great app 👍🏻 | love the stories | so good | I like the stories, but I don't like having to pay to watch 2 minutes or less. | I honestly love this app. I don't mind the ads, they aren't that long like other apps and the stories are really good. | I'm really excited about this opportunity to be part of this project | i would like to be able to watch more videos they get really interested | So addictive | got to pay to watch or watch tons of adds for one episode that goes for a Max of 2min. not worth it | you have to unlock everything for free the advert is too much | greet | it's good | you beautiful story lines always make me to come back to watch more | love ❤️ it | good movies | too much ads though | Wow i like this one | good acting, very nice | This app is AWESOME SAUCE to the max...I love it.👍 | great story | It's enjoyable to read.

To see the whole movie that I've been watching (90 episodes), it would cost $50, which is insane. I was paying $4.99 for Paramount Plus and Peacock, which have tons of options for shows and movies.

Prime video only costs $2.99 , but you have to pay $4.99 for just a 1,000 coins and each episode costs 68 coins. The show was interestingly different, but not good enough to I pay a ridiculous amount of money and it also kept signing me out and playing ads."",""Cool concept but poorly executed.

A minute long short costs 60+ credits, you get about 100 credits for $1 from what I gather. They automatically keep purchasing videos until you run out of credits, and don't let you know how much you're spending. Some credits dissappear mysteriously... overall shady and too expensive and inconsistent."",""Awful app. Every episode is 1 minute long. Then after every episode you get an ad and you can skip it, luckily, but then you have to watch a 30 second ad which is half the episode as it is. And you only get a few ads before you run out?? If you don't want to watch a bunch of ads, you have to pay for a bunch of coins (The lowest it goes it $4.99) but when you purchase it, you can't do it again. You have to pick a different price.

V aplikaci nelze vyvolat obrazovku s notifikacemi (jako proč??). Dokonce i okénko pro poslání feedbacku má tak NAHOVNO design, že se v textu nedá scrollovat běžným způsobem, ale posouváním kurzoru.

Místenky jsou nedostupné, oddíly neexistují. Tiché oddíly jsou bájné mytologické úkazy, které nikdo neviděl. Úplně vadný systém navyšování ceny s blížícím se datem odjezdu. Chápal bych, kdyby byly vlaky plné, ale jsou úplně prázdné. Dávat litr za cestu do Ostravy a zpátky s nefungujícími WC? Radši pojedu autem. Sám. | V porovnání s aplikacemi ze sousedních zemí bezkonkurenční vítěz. Přehledná, se spoustou informací které na sebe navazují a není třeba je někde lovit.

Za cenu ""vyhozené"" stovky nebo dvou čas od času ale přeskočíte stání v řadě u okýnka na nádraží. | easy to use | Aplikace ukládá nastavení ""počet osob"".

Také bych celkem uvítal možnost nahrát papírovou jízdenku do aplikace jelikož papírová jelikož text na papírové jízdence má po týdnu tendenci vyblednout k nepřečtení | Super aplikace, má ale jeden zásadní nedostatek. Při nakupu jízdenky a platbě kartou není možné ručně zkontrolovat certifikát platební brány. Jak má pak člověk vědět, kam zadává číslo své karty? Lepší varianta by byla, kdyby se při platbě otevřel systémový prohlížeč. | Uz umi google pay.

Do you have any issues with your online systems that don't show how many booking you have? | Aplikácia väčšinu času funguje bez problémov, prekvapuje ma ale spôsob hodnotenia cesty po ukončení jazdy - možnosť udelenia hviezd za dané (trochu irelevantné) kategórie bez možnosti komentáru České dráhy nijak neposunie dopredu. Bolo by vhodnejšie dať cestujúcim možnosť vyjadriť sa, čo sa im páčilo/nepáčilo. | 👍nice one | Update 09/2023: nad Moje jízdenky projistotu břibyl další link... Po posledních aktualizacích je záložka Jízdenky divná - otvírá ""Moji In Kartu"" a dříve jednoduše dostupné jízdenky (důležité zejména pro zobrazení místenky a řazení vlak) jsou ted skryte pod titěrným klikacim textem ""Moje jízdnenky"". (A te obrazovce moje jízdenky dominuje odporně velký zbytečný banner ""přihlášen jako"" s mým jménem!?! A počtem bodů). Stal se snad z této části aplikace jen zobrazovač univerzálního kusu webu? | Často se stává, že se jízdenka nenahraje do hlavního QR kódu, průvodčí načte pouze kupón inKarty a je nutné ukázat jízdenku zvlášť. Novinkou je problematické placení, kdy po potvrzení v bankovnictví a ťuknutí na Secure tlačítko Visy se proces zasekne, částka je zablokováná a lístek nezakoupený. | After last update, where payments via Google Pay can be done directly in the app, it seems this fixed lot of failed payments and missing tickets for me. | Skvělá appka. Přehledná, jednoduchá a funkční. | Pozor na volbu vice cestujících.. V rychlosti jsem přidal dalsi radky a ve vlaku nemile zjistil, že jsem přidal různé slevové jízdné... | Není možné vytvořit virtuální InKartu. Aplikace píše ""Pro daný e-mail bylo již vytvořeno příliš mnoho účtů"" a není zřejmé, co dál dělat. Nefunguje ani platba uloženou kartou, protokol mujvlak:// není rozpoznaný. Dříve aplikace fungovala bez chyb, teď je pro mě nepoužitelná. Edit: platba kartou funguje po odstranění dříve uložené karty, která od té doby expirovala.

Great interface easy to use Lovely to look at! Thank you!!! | good | I absolutely love this app. It has so much useful info and is more up to date than the info boards at train stations. 6/5 stars | Appka supr, ale chybí v ní jakákoli možnost zpětné vazby na konkrétní spoj, takže: proč musí být ve vagónech 369-367 spojů R9 Praha-Brno, které mají klimatizaci, 15 stupňů? Venku třicet a do vlaku aby člověk lezl v mikině. | Za poslední dva týdny mi aplikace zablokovala 2000 Kč bez vydání jízdenek. | Prosím přidat možnost koupit jízdenku jestli vlak už odjel. Teď funguje tak že jestli jsem nasoupil do vlaku na poslední chvíli není možné už jízdenku koupit (tlačítko nákupu mizí). Jinak funguje dobře. | purchased ticked, no sign of it. | crashing | Nefunkčnost google pay - platba potvrzena ale můj vlak ji nepotvrdí a nedostanu tak ani jízdenku... Nutnost použít platební kartu. | Super aplikace, akorát nerozumím řazení zakoupených jízdenek - úplně nahoře je včerejší jízdenka a dnešní až pod ní... Čekal bych, že aktuální jízdenka bude na prvním místě | Do not use. Purchases tickets from other companies for double the price. Fine if you're only going on CD trains. | One star for live train times and delays. Unfortunately the app is very unreliable and badly implemented, especially if you want to buy tickets. It blocks the money in your account, but there is no ticket and you don't have any feedback if it worked or not. So the buying is complete useless and will definitely gets you into trouble with no ticket riding if you use this app for tickets. | Dobrý | It made me buy the ticket twice, because couldn't verify rhe payment first. Of course my money is gone, and there is no receipt, nothing about about the first payment. Only my missing money. Never use this scam application! | občas se mi stává, že koupím jízdenku, peníze odejdou, ale jízdenka se v aplikaci nezobrazí | Defaultne filtruje pouze business jízdenky! | Jízdenku jsem zaplatil, peníze byly z účtu rezervovány, ale jízdenku jsem v aplikaci ani v e-mailu neobdržel. | GooglePay not working this afternoon, tried 3x, had to pay extra fee in the train | Broken for so long already, the chance your payment goes through is like 1 in 10, both Google pay and card. | Zaplatit jízdenku je samotný teror, 9 pokusů a platební brána ze strany ČD pořád blokuje mojí platbu. Občas vám platba projde, ale jízdenka nikde. | good | Dlouhy zvuk notifikace, dnes 'prosim aktualizujte z obcohud play', pritom mam aktualni, vcera aktualizovanou verzi, v obchode zadna novejsi nebyla. | After latest update application crashes few seconds since has been launched. | Very good | could be better, I miss dark mode but that's ok. | Cannot pay with credit card or Google pay. Used to happening before, appear to be fixed, but happens again | It gets the job done. A must have if you plan to travel by train. | Used to be a pretty decent app. This morning tried to buy ticket. App does not accept credit cards, shows error. Went to train station, bought ticket and paid extra 35 czk for seat reservation on top of inconvenience. Thank you for a quick fix! App works perfectly now after update! | Ani mi neodejde platba. Jednou se mi stalo že platba sice odešla, ale jízdenka se nezobrazila 🤡 ještě k tomu gpay v prohlížeči? Vážně? | Did not work with GooglePay on Android. | Naprostá notifikacni katastrofa. Nic nejde vypnout. | it is really helpful app and assistant so you can travel all over Europe with less cost and enjoyment | Use the IDOS app it's way better, but this also works. | To houkání mě vytáčí. Kdyby aplikace nehoukala, dám 5 hvězd. | Constantly nags you about stupid sh#@ while you desperately try to buy last minute ticket. Like this ""rate us"" prompt. | Super appka | nutí mě hodnotit aplikaci během používání aplikace. | Placení Google pay je nespolehlive. U jinych prodejcu nemam zadny problem s prubehem platby, jen tady projde az na podruhe a ne vzdy mi prijde jizdenka | Taking in account other supposedly free applications tha I as a Czech citizen have to pay for no matter if I use them or not - this one is slightly better then the one by DPP Prague. Still, unsolicited advertising and notifications that can't be disabled simply aren't acceptable under any circumstances. | Je fajn že tam je vše ale co mi to je platné když to píše zpoždění a pak zjistím že to jelo na čas. Plus kde se dá stornovat lístek když už si zaplatím lístek a stane se tohle tak bych ho rád stornoval. Nemluvě o tom že to nenapíše když vlak je jiného typu než máte lístek koupený a v aplikaci vám to neřeknou krásných 100 korun v (ha#%lu) děkuji. | The app cancelled my ticket by itself, without any notification. Would not use this again | Příjemná, snadno použitelná aplikace – uvítala bych možnost koupit lístek na zpožděný vlak po času pravidelného odjezdu a integraci Google Pay (úplnou, ne přesměrování na webové rozhraní). Bylo by také fajn upozorňovat na odstávky, občas se prostě appka tváří, že já nejsem online (jsem), aniž by někde byla informace, že od–do bude aplikace mimo provoz. | Poslední aktualizace rozbila funkcionalitu kontroly jízdenky přes NFC, předtím to roky fungovalo. Proč? | Aplikace je užitečná a z technického hlediska+ UI je celkem v pořádku. Rychlost jednotlivých úkonů je adekvátní & notifikace i e-maily doručené správně. Online rezervace a jízdenky v mobilu jsou teď jednodušší po zrušení - ne zcela logické - povinnosti předložení občanky, takže stačí ukázat QR kód v telefonu. Asi to nemá s apkou co dělat ale nebývám šťastným když mám jízdenku i s místenkou ale zjistit na nástupišti, že konkrétní číslo sedadla ani vozu neexistuje = chaos a nepříjemná komplikace | Často nefunguje... | Transakční brána nefunguje tak jak má, z mě neznámého důvodu a díky tomu jsem uvízl, protože mi ujel vlak. Jinak fajn aplikace | aplikace je nepřehledná a uživatelsky nepřátelská..... bez vysvětlení se dějou věci , které uživatel nechce, například je manipulován k zakoupení tarifu , který nechce !! Na cd inkartě je desetkrát ověřená totožnost majitele , a přesto průvodčí ve vlaku znovu vyžaduje další průkaz !!! pro ČD je zákazník zřejmě nepřítel .... | Absolutely usseless app, with customer support that prefers to lecture on the terms and conditions instead of making sure that the user experience is clear enough so that you don't end up making stupid mistakes. Maybe because those also happen to make them money. | Not a terrible app, however it does have a couple of flaws. For example, the ticket cannot be bought after scheduled departure time, even if the train is delayed. | Ve za s# | Hi, app is not bad ,but in case you are tight with budget and you changed your mind to replace older ticket for other and get refund,be ware of long time to add your money on account if you paid with Atm card or you don't have Czech ATM card, otherwise you like foreigner you can wait 3-6 days to get refunded..it's more simple with credit with you top up and refund should be back instantly.. funny is that also on station by window they cant do nothing with that , i mean to print you new ticket | problem s placením za lístek jsem musela zaplatit dvakrát a teď budu zdlouhavé čekat na vratku | Good | Přepínání mezi stranami pomocí menu dole zapomíná stav, což je vážně frustrující, když potřebujete cokoliv dohledat k existujícím lístkům. Pro zachování duševního zdraví je potřeba v systému přenastavit zvuk notifikace na defaultní, v aplikaci to nejde (leda si užíváte úchylné troubení vlaku každých 5 minut když se změní zpoždění). Jinak docela rozumná aplikace. | Neukazuje ceny! | Výborná aplikace pro cestování vlaky ČD | Som prekvapena, ze je to tak dobre funkcna aplikacia, ma to inkartu, informácie o vlaku, meskani, prehlad tabule na ktorejkolvek stanici a dokonca aj pocasie. Kupovanie listkov je prehladne a jednoduche. Nie som velky fanusik notifikacii, ale tu mi pridu uzitocne, napisu, na ake nastupiste vlak pride alebo kedy mate vystupit, je to super. | Opravdu povedená, super aplikace! Vše funguje jak má, má spoustu funkcí, vše je tam, kde bych to čekal. Na poměry Českých drah něco neuvěřitelného. | Vcelku ok, co me ale neskutečně vytáčí je změna jasu displeje u qr kódu. Chápu proč to tam je, ale nechci to, sam si zvýším jas pokud bude potřeba. Nebo by bylo dobré aspon přesunout jízdenky jinam, abych se k nim nemusel dostavat přes tu stránku s qr kódem a nevypalovalo mi to pokaždé večer oči. | Vše funguje bez problému, jen by se hodilo, pokud by obsah notifikace byl i při více notifikacích čitelný i bez prokliknutí. Umožnilo by to její přečtení i třeba na hodinkách. | A quick and easy way to buy train tickets in the Czech Republic. The English language version is very useful for visitors. | Aplikace je až překvapivě funkční. Akorát teda nechápu tu obsesi pojmenovat aplikaci tak, aby ji nebylo možné najít. Proč se to nemůže jmenovat České dráhy, nebo to nemá v názvu aspoň ČD aby byla aplikace v mobilu nějak normálně vyhledatelná, pro lidi co ji nepoužívají denně? | A completely shameful organisation that charges 3€ arbitrary cancelation fee and has the audacity to claim a quarter of a year as a valid period for returning your money to your account. Unbelievable. | Chyby při placení. Nešlo to uloženou kartou, ani přes google pay. | App is very complex and complicated. User needs to be patient and give it a chance, it gets better with time. But I have one major problem, Google Pay integration is just like any other card integration, there is no added value in it. Why it is not connected to integrated Google Pay in Android system, where you don't have to login a verify every transaction on web and mobile banking app. How is it possible that, you can integrate the ""right and simple"" way on iOS but not on Android? | Very useful. Real-time information about delays plus many more. | Very easy app | Aplikaci používám několik let a jsem s ní maximálně spokojen. Nákup lístků, rezervace popřípadě rušení - vše probíhá bez problémů. Dále platební možnosti a plánování budoucích výletů - i do zahraničí. 🙂 Několikrát jsem potřeboval změnit email v aplikaci, po kontaktování IT oddělení, vše proběhlo bez problémů. Co je také možné, je změna jazyka - český nebo anglický. Obecně vzato, aplikace funguje rychle a bez problémů. Palec nahoru dávám. 😉 | Although the app makes it very easy to find suitable connections and tickets, very often it does not show the operational delays, possible transfers and the changes in the route. | Doufám, že člověk, který zrušil výběr místenky z plánku, dostal padáka. | Nejhorší dopravce ever, má klasický spoždění 5-10 minut!🤬 Není schopnej počkat ani 30 vteřin na nástup do vlaku! Vlak přijede na druhej konec nástupiště, běžím za ním, a strojvůdce, ten největší kokot mi úmyslně zavře dveře před očima!😡🤬🤬🤬 A ani výluka 5 vlaku za sebou a čekání z pravidla několika hodin není výjimkou! Chtějí po vás koupit lístek i v případě že máte už týden z aktivovanou lítačku! Udělejte s tím bože něco! | Koupil jsem si jízdenku přes appku, 10 min před odjezdem jsem chtěl upgrade do první třídy. Přes ""změnit/zrušit"" mi appka nabídla pouze storno. Tak jsem stornoval a koupil nový lístek do 1.třídy. Pak mi přijde e-mail, že storno bylo možné max 15min před odjezdem. Bylo by dobré, kdybyste toto zavedli přímo do aplikace, abych si nemohl stornoval jízdenku, když už to vaše smluvní podmínky nedovolují. Rozhodně by to bylo více user friendly. | GORGEOUS | - It is not possible to tick ""Direct connections only"" without opening the settings below. - There is no option to turn off the automatic brightness adjustment when viewing the QR code, so it blinds you when you buy tickets in the evening. - It sometimes suggests completely random stations I've never visited. - It probably doesn't use your phone's location so it once suggested me the stations in the opposite order, so I had a ticket in the opposite direction. - The app doesn't have a dark mode!! | Add the possibility to scan the paper ticket's qr code and then use the app instead of the paper ticket. | Very much uset friendly user interface for the Czech ráilway transport. | no chance to reserve return ticket | Very easy to find connections and book tickets. | Apka je vesmes dobra, nekde mozna zbytecne preplacana, uzitecne informace lehce zapadnou(napr. Vyluky by mohli byt prehlednejsi). Vazne bych uvital,aby listky nad urcitou hodnotu meli automaticky zdarma mistenku(bud si vyberu nebo mi je system priradi). Jezdim pres 4 hodiny s pritelkyni k rodicum a kdyz zapomenu vybrat mista,tak zpetne si je musim za 70kc dokoupit. | Ztratil jsem penize kvuli chybejicimu spoji v teto aplikaci (behem srovnani s IDOSem, kde ve stejnou dobu tam byl hodne podobny spoj, ale delsi trasa). | Můžu s velkou přesností sledovat zpoždění svého vlaku 10/10 | App works okay. But, I would immensely appreciate if there would have been an option about the direction of the train when purchasing the ticket. This is like shooting in the dark for someone who suffers from motion sickness. Overall, notifs come on time more or less. Add an arrow of the direction and it will be 5*. | Úžasná aplikace, všechno skvělý, živý pozice vlaku (zatím ne na mapě, ale podle stanice), plánovač kterej prostě funguje (narozdíl od jiných), jediný co nefunguje jsou odjezdy že stanic které nejsou v ČR (ale to se dá pochopit), a taky nemůžu sledovat živě vlaky které nejsou od ČD (ale to se zase dá pochopit). A taky žádné reklamy. | Great app, but recently it's not possible to pay with Google pay. | Dneska 27.8.2022 mám pocit že máte nějaký problém. Furt je napsáno chyba komunikace se serverem. I když klasický web funguje dobře. Je to tak? | super apka, vše funguje jak má | Poněkud nepřehledná appka, ale funkce tam jsou dobré a funguje spolehlivě. | nice app | Useful, logic, simple. | Funkční ale omezená. Lze vyhledávat spojení a kupovat jízdenky pouze pro ČD. Nelze stornovat pouze jednoho pasažéra, nutno vrátit celou jízdenky nejpozději den předem a koupit znovu. Hodně štěstí pokud na vás zbyde místenka. Asi lepší kupovat jízdenky jednotlivě, dokud se nad tím ČD nezamýslí, ale stále jako faktický monopol, proč by se obtěžovali. Používejte raději IDOS, který vám najde i kombinované spojení s busem či konkurenci. | Ukazujete neexistující vlaky, doporučuje přestupní vlaky které ve stanici kde vystupujem ani nezastavují. Často nezobrazí výluku ale vlaky které by jeli kdyby nebyla. Za spoždění 3+hodin by se i na iredo jízdenky mělo vztahovat nějaké finanční odškodnění. Když se vlak spoždí třeba přes hodinu a jízdenka nám kvůli tomu v posledním spoji časově nevyjde, tak to není chyba nás, proto by se měla udělat alespoň nějaká výjimka když už musíte mít pokaždé spoždění. | Ostatní u nás by se mohli učit jak to má vypadat | Bloody charlatans - I paid the money and no ticket arrived. So I've been forced to buy another one. Damn robbery. | Ze jsou stránky českých drah šílené není tajemství, ale vypustit aplikaci, která se při nákupu nenačítá a hází errory aniž by vysvětlila co je špatně je troufalé. | Skvělé pro zjištění aktuálních výluk a zpoždění, ale při nákupu jízdenek aplikace pohořela. Nepodporuje ""vestavěný"" Google Pay a posílá na internetovou platební bránu, což zabere spoustu času a na mobilu je velmi nepraktické. Raději zůstanu u OneTicket. | Ok | is friendly app, and fast. | User friendly app. Easy and reliable. | App doesnt communicate with the server. It is useless now, cannot search connections or even log in. | Working good and is simply to use - for me the interface ia customer friendly. It had a Czech and an English version as well and the app informa the travellers about news regarding the train. | Good | Great app. Very useful for booking tickets , seat reservations, upgrades. I haven't had a problem reserving seats. If it's all blocked out in red. Check the class of the coach. | Awesome app | Absolutely horrible app | Otřesná nová podoba, nepřehledné, crashuje při koupi jízdenek. | Reliable app BUT I'd you own a lidacka use the PID lidacka app since it is often cheaper to buy their travel passes. You still need this app to by transit fir bikes though.","{""1"":2467,""2"":722,""3"":1855,""4"":6513,""5"":30024}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","České dráhy, a.s.","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9+dr%C3%A1hy,+a.s.","mujvlak@gmail.com","http://www.cd.cz/",,"https://www.cd.cz/e-shop/o-eshopu/-30156/","%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9+dr%C3%A1hy,+a.s.","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Of_LXw48h6Ld9zALE253MUN5flEt4Xl5YNdeKLJzRkXxjbv6N0D1zQfa-rcMjrJ9OGZC","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oMA9FplYai5WLX0aA0O20HdBuw9yFTyRhihxl6_sfo9ne8oWYqdXB5btesKYGWIA7k0","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rE8orflEubtTrF5ajhm1LoKI-ZZJ4lkcnvMiOrZM0efEPYI8TPuAuABwL0P-WOpuOQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9rGt7oHRhGYBGcUZjXawHA9dINuZHiqabfvBc8ry3Jm5Rel26sQcGnR6AiUEq2J8vLc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VkTA74fy6tE-osbrt9spWdwauZXDBxN4b54zLuWftn_EIYut_FkeACKH3t38Dw6KlS0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1ABJ3SvV35eqEqLGMjt6b9-yFaT8G7uMSXnxeMtaWGnlXHRxtOeBdS7mXaxXqE171Bk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GUEGsHOpvAHw30K6BEYslEu7tA3K5KSY-2aMLE-Bu4W3dfnxxZSqeYCGxlB5NFUIQQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-1U7fG20wDcj0pFeXHCqkp7sa64suEtBEY-iR641AP3lONhbfeDBN5VusKox84jOjQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-KdVjEkesvAmvDgzKOezlyq15Rxh8oZVtIo9FsCxNQg7QWAZbNqUN0UIi-S5zayxPtI""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8RPnkusH3U?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oMA9FplYai5WLX0aA0O20HdBuw9yFTyRhihxl6_sfo9ne8oWYqdXB5btesKYGWIA7k0",,"PEGI 3",,false,"Oct 29, 2014",1704282682000,"2.11.2","1.

I walked 2 miles more than the day before but the calorie count was 200 less then the day before. How can I fix this? The edit option only works for the number of steps and miles. Also. Goggle shows there's 2000 steps to a mile.

That's all I wanted. I don't need all the other junk. Thanks | Good yes | The app is is simple and is exactly what I was looking for. | Checked it against two other apps, Google Fit and another one which has a whole lot of ads before you can get to the information. Information. Way better than Google Fit and equal to the one with a lot of ads. So this is now my best bet at accurate stuff counts ! | Nice app | Accurate. Easy to use. | Good reliability, takes up little space, nice stats | I like this app. It works for the most part...its accuracy is ok. Seems to be off 10-20 steps but I can deal with that. I've used this app for years. Overall a great app. | Very useful to leave running in the background to check activity levels | Works like a Charm | Awesome trackage | Very good 👍 👏 👌 | Love this app helps me keep track of my daily steps with ease | I removed it to reduce data maybe two years ago and added it back yesterday. Earlier my steps reached nearly 3000. I just checked after several hours and all I see at 2:39am is only 297 steps. I wasn't wearing it as before but I'm puzzled. Did it start over at midnight? Why don't I see my original steps? I'm testing it and In a few days I will have a much better idea of how well it actually works to know if I am pleased with it like before. | Great tool helps a lot. | My only problem is when I put it in my pocket it stops. | Very useful | Just what I needed | Fairly accurate, simple to use and you don't need.your location or data on. | Use it every day. | it's really nice | Keeps me well informed. | Accurate step counter | Good | This is a marvelous app to track your walking and how many steps you do per day ,wished I knew about this free app before!

As a little project, in conjunction with me training at the gym, etc, I decided to record the number of steps I would walk The app is very accurate in calculating my steps. It gives me daily, weekly, and monthly graphs, and I can start and stop the step recording whenever I need to (which is only at the beginning and end of my work shift) There's a short ad for a few seconds only | App no longer works anymore.

při usínání, ale co když někoho zbytečně vyrušíte při řízení, poskytování 
první pomoci nebo nedejbože dokonce při sexu? | Nová: už za počin a pravidelnou údržbu si zaslouží maximální hodnocení.

telefonního čísla (ne, nepomohl update, ani odinstalovat a nainstalovat), 
což je obtěžující, nicméně se jedná o velice chvalyhodný počin a neměla by

odmítnout, je na jednu hvězdu že zásady. | Automatic switch on of the location is missing .. | Asi jednou týdně mě aplikace žádá o ověření tel čísla. Přitom říká že moje

Uzivatel si toho nevsimne a omylem spusti alarm skutecne (tak jako ja, bohuzel). | Proč chybí Nemocnice Hořovice, ačkoliv tam Beroun je (stejný vlastník)? | Myslím určení polohy GPS je supr a záchranka dostane polohu | Skvely napad a elegantni reseni. Instaluji rodicum. Co je potreba upravit: Pri nouzovem hovoru uz se aplikace NESMI dotazovat na ruzna opravneni, napr. Access to make phone calls. Zraneny clovek nemusi byt ve stavu je acceptovat. Veskera akceptacni opravneni musi probehnout pri prvnim spusteni. Pokud to neni mozne, doporucuji vynutit testovaci nouzovy hovor pri prvnim spusteni aplikace, aby probehlo end-end nastaveni nouzoveho scenare. Jinak tisicere diky, vynikajici myslenka. Drzi. Palce na integraci s okolnimi staty a hasici. | Aplikace je skvělá, až na jeden detail.  Bylo by možné, aby se při prvním spuštění dotázala na všechna potřebná oprávnění (pozice, SMS, telefonování) bez nutnosti použít testovací režim? Jinak bude uživatel v nouzi řešit, co to najednou po něm telefon chce. | Velmi ocenuji Vasi praci. | Aplikace sr rozhodla, že mi bude co 5 minut hlásit, že je dnes ""...den linky 155"". Super :D | Proč najednou vyžaduje aplikace právo zjistit běžící aplikace? | Aplikace je skvela, hodne de mi libi moznost najiti si nejblizsich lekarskych zarizeni. Pokud je toale mozne, uvital bych, aby ""rotovala"", kdyz otocim telefon. Na jednu stranu to muze byt rusit, kdyz budu manipulovat s telefonem a zaroven se zranenym, ale diky tomu, ze mi spadl telefon na zem, mi nejede vrchni pulka displeje, tudiz se nedostanu bez otoceni telefonu k nektrym funkcnim. Kdyz se nekomu takhle rozbije mobil treba pri srazce, tak to je problem. Bylo by fajn, kdyby to tam bylo jako on/off funkce | UPDATE: Škoda, že přidání reklamy na Vodafone ma větší prioritu než přidání manuální volby jazyka :-( PŮVODNÍ TEXT: Přimlouvám se jako spousta ostatních pro přidání manuální volby jazyka. Je to jednoduchá věc a aplikace bude v češtině i na anglickém telefonu a hlavně nedojde ke zbytečnému připojení na anglického operátora. | Take se primlouvam jako spousta dalsich k moznosti rucni volby jazyka. Neni nas malo, co maji nastaven telefonu v jinych jazycich z ruznych duvodu, ale nedava smysl prepojovani na anglickeho operatora. Ani ve vasich slibovanch updatech pro podzim to nevidim. | Používám telefon s anglickým prostředím, ale tuto aplikaci bych měl opravdu rád v češtině. Kolik dalších recenzi budete potřebovat aby jste to konečně implementovali? Slibujete už to uživatelům od března. | Chci si aplikaci prohlédnout, ale bojím se jí otevrít, abych neprivolal pomoc. | Super napad, stahla jsem, jen doufam ze ji nikdy nebudu potrebovat ;) | Great app | Jen jedna drobnost - mám telefon nastavený na angličtinu a v této aplikaci nemůžu nijak změnit prostředí na české. Takže i volám na linku s anglickým operátorem což je dost nepraktické. To by chtělo opravit | Better safe than sorry | Aplikace vypadá OK, ale nejde zvolit jazyk - mobil mám v angličtině... | Velká škoda, že aplikace nejde v nastavení přepnout do češtiny | Velmi užitečná aplikace. Vše funguje bez chyb. Také bych se přimlouval za možnost volby češtiny.

Freundliche Grüße DE Tetris Umzüge Küchenmontage Team . | easy and saving | Terrible app, wouldn't let me use my bank card in spite of that being the only means of payment, great app guys bravo 👏 | PSA: The app charges a service fee for every booking unless you take a monthly subscription. It's not a small amount too. This is unnecessary as they provide absolutely no added features for the premium. You can use Parkster instead, which charges no extra fees and had an even better UI in my opinion. (UI is subjective, I feel the disc UI in easy park is a bit gimmicky) | Great app and easy to use! A must if you drive in Norway. | Dyrare än att betala i automat eller med Parkster, eftersom Easypark saltar p-avgiften. | The app is easy to use and I have used it in 1.5 years. However, they increased the service fee incredibly this year and started to take percentage of the transaction which made it a worse choice and it's safer to use the parking machines again. It doesn't also show the price per hour in each choice so I have to use the spin every time to get the price info before parking which is not convenient. Unfortunately I'm not going to use it again with this high service fees. | I'd give 0 starts if I could! I got hooked by an easypark employee that called one day convincing me to switch to a business account. It was supposed to cost less than 5€ a month and cancelable at any time. They kept sending me invoices of more than 35€ every month. I didn't pay them and kept sending emails to their support email but didn't receive any reaction. They send an invoice through an insolvency agency claiming they've started insolvency proceeding. I kept reaching out without success. | I'm using an Australian mobile. I tried 4 times to do the verification. Every time it says the number typed is incorrect. I type in exactly the number I receive with the SMS. Can't use it. | Disgusting app. Implementing that all you just excluded all elders from the future. Its extremely unclear how it works. If mistake made no way to correct mistake before you submit the payment. If time slot booked incorrect there no way to extend time slot booked. Extremely stupied and poorly desined app. Should never be implemented before its easy and clear to use. And going round and round to make 12 hours parking stay is extremely stupied. Hope developers have honor to adjust app. | Karttaan merkittyihin alueisiin ei voi luottaa ollenkaan. Kaikki vedetty näköjään hatusta,kun sakkoja tulee vaikka on merkityllä alueella. The parking areas on the map are not trustworthy at all. I was on a marked area and still got a ticket. Useless service. | App is completely useless and Easy Park customer service is even worse. I parked in Denmark at a hotel. The hotel informed me they have an agreement with Parkzone so I could park for free. I informed about my EasyPark active parking and they said it will be cancel after my Parkzone will end. Great. However EasyPark app continue to be active and customer ""service"" is not helping me checking if my parking is active or not. The app don't allow me to cancel. I can not recommend Easy Park to anyone | I used this app and then my card details were stolen- after speaking to my bank they said there's been an increase in cases related to this parking app. Do not use | I downloaded this app, added my phone number and it said wait for a code and it never arrive, it is not working. | Kann mich nicht mehr anmelden.

Klasse, wenn das auch die einzige Möglichkeit ist, wie man sich bei der App anmelden kann 👌 Liegt auch nicht daran, dass ich alle Nummern von Easypark blockiert hatte nachdem Mitarbeiter mich im stundentakt angerufen haben um mir ein Abo zu verkaufen und es nicht geschafft haben untereinander zu kommunizieren wen sie schon belästigt haben. Schade, alle Nummern von Easypark entblockiert, obwohl der SMS-Login sowieso nicht geht. | Hello. I don't receive SMS upon registration. I can't login. The Norwegian number is correct. | After having deleted the app, I couldn’t download anymore. It says ‘not available in your country or region’ whilst I have not changed country nor region. | To avoid at all cost, business model is NULL. You pay parking to avoid get a ticket. Then an agent mistaken or who knows, maybe easypark is stealing us and not reporting parking .. then you get a ticket and customer service ask you to check with police .. I paid using your app for simplicity and not to follow bureaucracy nor follow your app bugs or your stealing .. you should be always responsible to handle active sessions with police agents or you pay the ticket or close your business. | Repeated data leaks of personal information Edit: latest data breach on the 10th of December 2023.

No one want to be surprised by parking ticket when you were sure it has been taking care of. Please fix the issue or add notification if when we choose car, parking time and doesn't go through. | Bekomme keinen Code per SMS. | L'app è generalmente buona e semplice, ma ha due GROSSI problemi: 1. Non ti avvisa in nessun modo quando sta per scaderti il parcheggio, quindi mi è capitato di beccarmi la multa perché non me ne ero accorta che dovevo prorogare e 2. Non si può inserire più di 1 carta per il pagamento, quindi metti caso che non hai più soldi su quella inserita, devi fare tutto l'ambaradan di inserire un'altra carta da capo. Piccole cose facili da sistemare e invece ancora niente... | Push notifications don't work causing a 2x$98 fine.. that's 200 dollars because the app won't notify me when times up! I feel that it doesn't work well so they can sting you in parking fines. What a joke. Fix your app my next step is the ACCC. | Worst app you can possibly have. The revolut cards don't work to be registered (they give a ""fraud"" error) and for a 0,30 CHF parking the app had a service fee of 0,47. Not recommended!!! Later edit: although I have a revolut account (both in CHF and €) my euro account was debited of course adding the exchange rate accordingly. This makes parking even more expensive than withdrawing money from the ATM and simply paying using cash. I am very sorry I cannot rate it 0 stars!!! | didnt recieved verification sms, several retries | No parking spots available in any of the cities I need parking in. Seems like not many users on thus app. | First thing this app does is asking your phone number. I haven't even seen any parking space yet. Crazy. | Registrierung beim Start funktioniert nicht - ich bekomme trotz mehreren Versuchen keine SMS. Aber wenn das mit den 15% Zusatzgebühren stimmt, ist es sowieso unverschämt teuer. Dann lieber zur (gebührenfreien) Konkurrenz. | It wants my phone number at start. No way! | Borked! Never receive any SMS to register. | This is the most shady and potentially unlawful company. First, they underwent a ""cyberattack"", which apparently led to all kinds of personal information leaked. Now, they ask for a fee to keep the normal account features on. The relevant authorities should definitely investigate Easypark and force them to compensate us for the loss (or sale) of data. I will initiate a petition to demand compensation. | Easy means easy. | Works perfectly well | Stupid app, wants some fees. Im using Litacka instead. Not gonna pay for parking AND 3rd party service. Make the fee 5% and I consider. 15% is just too much | Cool app | User unfriendly. The app has minimal online help and its phone help-line verges on useless due to untrained staff. The app provided no information about details such as when the park is metered, security of the park after hours, parking duration limitations (the area included 2 hour and 4 hour parks). This type of information is not difficult to present. The app did not explain how it calculated the tariff. The printed instructions provided at parking station were ""fine print"". Avoid EasyPark. | easy park it's simple 👌 you can test by the name easy park it's easy and simple. | Doesn't work when attempting to register it in Norway. Tried using multiple phone numbers from different countries. Called up support staff that wasn't able to help. | such an awesome app. very content and easy. I highly recommend this parking app | toppen | where was this app before, great! | This app is trash. Gives me a data error on both my phones! | Le parking dans ma rue à Reims devenant payant, j'ai téléchargé cette application. Elle ne fonctionne pas du tout et demande tous les détails de ma carte bleue. J'ai bêtement tout donné et suis maintenant très inquiète. | good | I just got a call from their office for marketing. Not only the staff was very rude but also I didn't even consent to any marketing. | Körs i bakgrunden och gör reklam för sig själv. Får väl avinstallera den när jag inte använder den. | Easy Park in Australia is rubbish. Always have error with the simplest things including login. | Can't pay for two parked cars at the same time. Annoying and quite expensive for me as I have managed to get a couple of parking tickets. (Partly/mainly my own fault but it's damn annoying) | Ikävä kyllä tämä taitaa olla suht pakollinen, jos haluaa välttää parkkisakkoja kohtuullisella vaivalla. Kehittäjät pitäisi pakottaa käyttämään. | App and website need some serious attention. Won't let you update payment details saying they're invalid despite being correct. Contact support and they end up telling me it is because of keyboard extensions. If your app can't accept typing from certain keyboards, your app is the problem. Have previously been having issues of my old car coming back to being the default car, thankfully that seems to have been dealt with. | Best apps for find parking. | This EasyPark is a good solution when need to quickly solve the parking in an area where there are no paying machines or they are not close, but the camera parking option is a scam! In a location where for example the daily parking cost 20eur, with camera parking you pay 23eur. No thank you. | Very useful | Viser ingen information(er) om, hvilken zone numre der gælder i København. Viser en liste af muligheder som ""vælg parkering"" hvor man ikke kan trykke på nogen af dem. Indtaster man numrene som står, så får man en fejl om det er et ugyldigt nummer. | Service fee???? | Due to lag, accidentally selected wrong zone and received parking fine. What happened: Opened app, a zone no. appeared on the top, verified it with sign board and proceeded to tap it. Apparently, number updated to different no. by the time I looked up and verified on sign. Didn't realise it, thus must have tapped wrong zone although the parked address was correct, so I left parking area. Parking inspector should be able to verify if the wrong zone is selected, and warn instead of fine. | easy to use usuffull | easy peasy | Worst than useless | I HATE this app. Every time I use it, it has forgotten my account, and when I try to log in again, I verify my phone number via sms, but then I ALSO have to enter the registration number of a car I've previously used. WHY!? 😡 I don't own a car! I use a carpool. I get a car with a different registration number every time, why on earth would I even try to remember them!? | Charges additional 13% fee | Wants me to enter a 6 digit code sent via SMS, however SMS is a 4 digit code. Exact reverse happened to me yesterday. Unable to use the app. | I have a new phone and tried to log in, it says enter a 6 digit code but then messages me a 4 digit code. There is no other options in the App at all. | Trying to install. Asks for a 6 pin code but it only sends a 4 pin code. Can't progress the install. | Reached out to support twice after easypark lost customer data in a hack and still no reply 3 months later... Avoid at all costs. | Please don't spam useless update notifications in the default notification channel. Put it in a channel I can turn off. Background: Rollouts on the Play Store are slow and there are never any updates ready when apps notify about it. | Just had an email from EasyPark informing me that my name, email, phone, physical address has been compromised by a cyber attack. Edit: They are introducing service charges for Prague. I suggest alternatives like the PID app. | Comfy | Hidden charges of unspecified amounts? Seems legit. Sure I will pay for the parking and for your stupid app .... Not. | no cash and no searching the parking automat | App works but why is there a service fee? | Best parking app there using it since 3 years now. | 27 minutos intentando anular una multa sin éxito. Me descargué la app para perder el tiempo y acabar teniendo que pagar la multa sin poder anularla, cuando aún faltaban 28 minutos. En todo ese tiempo, resultó ser más bien DifficultPark porque de ""easy"", nada. | A joke of an app. | bequemer als barzahlung, aber seit dem es parknow nicht mehr gibt, habe ich nur probleme mit easypark. schon 2x ist es jetzt passiert, dass ich die parkzeit gestartet habe und dann später entdeckt habe, dass sie doch nicht gestartet wurde (und nun habe ich einen strafzettel bekommen). außerdem fand ich's bei parknow besser, dass am ende des monats insgesamt berechnet wurde, statt ständig diese kleinbeträge abgebucht zu bekommen. | Great app! It's rare these days to see apps and services with this high quality. It clear, it's responsive, and you can easily adjust the parking time as you go. Kudos to the team working on this. | I had the app and deleted it, uninstalled it and just seen youre still taking money! Edit.....have taken yet another payment out! Not happy! | schön | Applicazione fatta bene ma fees troppo alte. 30 centesimi di FEE per un parcheggio da 30 centesimi assurdo | Great app, also love the Android Auto feature. The latter would be even better if the parking action would cancel automatically when the car starts leaving the parking zone. | App doesnt work - made me pay 18 euros for 3 hours of parking... do not recommend. | Avoid, Ultra overpriced... | Cant change payment method currently, Only white screen appears and freezes. | works well | Can't add credit card. Inputfield for Security code is cut off. | Cant add card from Lithuania for parking in Sweden. Rubbish! | In some spots u r charged an hourly rate for afew minutes | great | Absolutely amazing application give you 5star | Great app to use 👏 | Right now my car is at my house, but someone has still started a parking with my regnumber at another location. Since it is a camera parking, I can't stop the faulty parking! Will be interesting if I have to pay for this. | No payment methods work. Credit card, google pay etc. Customer service is so slow. I have been trying to pay off a stupid 4 euro unpaid parking for months but they just can't make it work. Uninstalling the app and never coming back again. Fail fail fail. | Skal instalere appen å gi flere stjerner når det er mulig å bruke den med Vipps eller å ha mulighet å parkere på gratis parkering i inntil 2 timer uten å måtte registrere betalingsmetode på forhånd. | bra | What can be simpler? Location on, pick a vehicle, spin the wheel, payment in credit card later. 💯 | It would be great to have a watch app with this. | Easy to use | Easy to use | just a bit expensive | good | Works perfectly in the eu | so much better than caring euros around | Save yourself a lot of trouble and skip this app. The company claims to not be responsible for the parking space it explicitly charges you for. Due to this I have received a ticket from parking operator and the company's official status is for the customer to pay the fine (with rental company's administration fee on to of it in my case) and then seek a refund by writing to parking spot operator with easypark receipt. This is a mockery and not how a real company operates. 0 stars from me. | Unforgivable flaw of not protecting user data. The leak is a catastrophic risk of getting phished by criminals forever as this data is never going to fade away. | Same parking lot, other company charges 140 for one day. Easypark charges 160. So if there is another option, consider using that instead. | Easy Park is really nice and very easy.... | good | 15% av parkeringskostnad i avgift.. nej tack. | The app is great, love the option to enter the zone manually OR autodetect! The start-parking screen is very good! The service charge is fair, but given that this is only an intermediary between the user and parking authority, It is illogical why the fee increases with the length of parking, but I don't mind it too much. As an owner of multiple cars, I desperately need the option to start additional concurrent parkings, that would bring it to 4 stars! The UI is sometimes glitchy, but workable. | GPS location works fine, does not show car park, can not select car park at all, app is useless. | best app.thanks EasyPark | Later edit: my phone number is now being spammed by scam callers from all around the world. You get hacked and you have the audacity to name my home address ""non sensitive"" data??? How dare you? In Copenhagen we have no choice but to use your service in order to park around. It is not a cyber attack, it is gross incompetence and carelessness on your behalf. Why do you need my home address for anyway? How about you offer Google Pay or Mobile Pay alternatives. Incompetent cheapskates. | Comfortable | The interface is nice and that's it. I turned off SMS notifications, but they didn't stop to send them anyway. Every SMS sent by EasyPark dies cost an additional 15 cent to a 49 cent fee for every completed parking. Once and never again. | Da easypark a easyfine e' un attimo!! Pago il biglietto per non ricevere la multa e mi ritrovo la multa!!. Affidatevi a dei programmatori che vi facciano un app come si deve, non che mi segnala un'area e poi mi viene registrato tutt'altro. Inoltre mando una mail per reclamare la multa e non risponde nessuno. | super easy to use and cheap too. | One of the best apps. Always works flawlessly. I hope they expand their network to other cities in Germany. | This is the scam nobody can avoid. This company charges you for parking, but, if there is a problem with parking authority, there is no support. I got a fine in italy which is due to a bug in easy park, but, there is no support from them, I finally ended up paying the ticket. Totally a scam which i can not avoid to use because i need to park my car and governments have cobtract with this one. | Careful and remove the renral plate from your account or you will be wrongfully charged for parking you haven't done and the Money will not be coming back😓 | Costs more than paying by the machine. Spin to select time is slow and annoying! +12 +1 buttons so much easier. Will not be using this app | Enostavna uporaba, zanesljivo delovanje. | Absurde Gebühren. 0.49€ bei einem 1.25€ Parkschein | So easy and so convenient. Best thing in Italy as far as experience is concerned. I travel frequently and this App is one of the best I have ever seen. | Over 20% ""fees"" charged afterwards by EasyPark. Very bad business style 😕 | Worst app ever made. | Alles super | nice and easy | Can't add neither a Swiss debit card nor PayPal as payment method. Also lacks the option of TWINT for payments. Thus, I'd say the app is utterly useless for many people living in Switzerland. | OBS VARNING! Blev bedragen på 530kr av detta bolag. Appen visar inte rätt 'zoner' på kartan så man vet aldrig om parkeringen är betald. Fick både en parkeringsböter och ingen återbetalning av felaktigt betalad parkering. I och med detta hänvisar jag alla potentiella användare till andra appar. Kundtjänst har ej varit behjälplig och kommer ta detta bedrägeribolag till rätten för deras olagliga agerande. | Data breach of some data from this app => low rating. | L'app funziona bene ma quello che non mi piace è la commissione di 0.29/€ che si prende EasyPark sul costo del parcheggio. Se fate una sosta breve non conviene, ci rimettete solo. Meglio cercare una colonnina e pagate con le monete o con le carte. | Can't end parking. Camera didn't work. App provides zero help in this case. | Very nice app | Could not find how to oay for 12 months. Very clunky app | awesome. | Badly needs a reminder to select correct number plate before start of parking, was booked due to this issue, yes was my fault, though a reminder would have been handy. Other than this issue it is a great app. | amazing parking app | 1 star for forced review | Notifications do not work, so parking expires without notifying me. Customer support offered no help here, simply said to check my notifications then stopped responding. It's a clear bug and I am willing to help as much as possible to provide logs or testing but it seems the team is not interested, so the result is you risk getting parking fines if you don't set your own calendar/alarm reminder. | Wont accept any credit card. I have tried 3 and all failed... | This app leaked payment cards to hackers, no email notification of this, or anything, just a ""we are sorry"" notification in app. Avoid. do not give them your credit card details! | Very practical | awesome concept, and extremely easy to use app. Hats down :) | 15% service fee is a ripoff. Shame. | Iltalehti, Easyparkin tiedote: ""Parkkiyhtiö varoittaa: luminen rekisterikilpi voi tuoda sakon Pysäköintimaksuja välittävä Easypark muistuttaa, että lumen peittämä rekisterikilpi saattaa olla peruste liikennevirhemaksulle. Vastuu puhdistamisesta on kuljettajalla."" Tähän loppui Easyparkin käyttö, ja jatkossa käytetään autoissamme vain Parkman tai Taskuparkki sovelluksia. EDIT. Nyt kun Easypark on kaiken lisäksi hakkeroitu, loppuu käyttö kokonaan. | Awful app I was at my parents apartment for a few hours, I forgot the time so the time went out, i tried to extend it but it couldn't do it without being on the spot, so a few min later i went to my car and i got a damn ticket, go with another app, this is garbage!! | svindlere | Not able to protect customer data. | great app, it works perfectly! | Works well enough, but push notifications don't work | Goes take Google pay, but does take payments (against policy). Keeps flagging cards as fraud....when you have to pay using card when traveling internationally.... 🤦 | US citizen traveling to Australia. Unable to register my credit card. The app claimed it was a problem with VISA but the card provider saw no blocks. EasyPark support tried sending an SMS to my phone and that failed also. | The ""small fee"" is 3-5 TIMES, more then the others charge. First I used Easypark via Mercedes me, I thought that price is higher than usual only for Mercedes users. But installed the app, proved that they really using unfair price policies. They are invoice more than the valid parking fee, and they also invoice more than the agreed transaction fee. This is not only unfair, but fraud. Uninstalled immediately. | it's a useful APP | For 20 minutes parking in Aachen Germany it's charge full hour. The government should Stop these scammer. | Won't even tell how many people they have lost information on, stay away from such companies, this is like the equifax hack. | I love it. its easy to use and so so convenient | It's been hacked | Easy to loose your PII with EasyPark due to lack of preventive security measures. | Idioter | Got hacked | 12 dage før I oplyser I er blevet hacket! Det er under alt kritik! | Hacked, all your data leaked. | Uninstalling because of the way they handle the data breach. - literally playing the victim card by stating everywhere ""We were the victim of a cyber attack."". No EasyPark - your customers were. - ambiguity around exactly what data was accessed other than that according to official EU regulations, it's considered ""non-sensitive customer data"". - ""We are sorry"" but no offer to make it up to customers in any way | Never works in Stockholm's Gallerian. Sick of having to pay fines because, after loggin time and location discovering that the app has stopped working after sevetal seconds. Utter scam. | Works around 20% of the time, errors are not descriptive, and my personal data leaked... I don't have an issue with paying the fee for the convenience but this is worse than just finding the machine | Very nice app for parking! | They got hacked Which can happen...but no concrete security arrangements have been named. Also no concrete information about each data have been stolen. ....so sketchy | During the cyber atack my name, email, and some characters from my debit card were compromised. I don't recommend using this app. | Adds an additional fee to the parking fees. Recently hacked (so poorly programmed). Thank you very much. Uninstalling. | Very effective, and easy and useful way to pay parking tickets. | Data is leaking like some popstar's unreleased songs | Parking extra fee is a joke. Sometimes if you want to park for just one hour for 1 euro. Often the service fee is more than 1 euro. Why should i pay double? And they call this the future of parking. Let's also talk about the recent Cyberattack where a tons of users data has been leaked, while the company failed at every security measures and played it down saying, well b-but this happens to others too! Been using the app for 6 Months. I wouldn't recommend. Security risk and waste of money. | data breach with a message that they are very, very sorry, but not getting into the nature of the breach beyond ""your data was accessed"". My advice is to beware and note that this company is based in a country that doesn't take data privacy and protection as seriously as other countries do, which is pretty much expressed in their weak response to some sort of massive data breach. | Total disregard for customer data, and basic app security, proven by your last data breach :( | The ui is great and simple, but for each parking you are going to be charged extra fee, ridiculous. I recommend everyone to switch to PID litacka and pay for parking for free. | Perfect 👍👍","{""1"":19515,""2"":2037,""3"":13296,""4"":24662,""5"":259490}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","EasyPark AS","EasyPark+AS","support@easypark.net","https://www.easypark.com/","Positionen 103

Fakt super přístup a přechod k levnější konkurenci i bez aplikace se blíží... | Chyba 1004, nefunguje vůbec | V aplikaci se nezobrazují transakce ani jakou částkou mám dobitou tankovací kartu...v tom případě slouží akorát na sbírání bodů...celkem zbytečné. | Bohuzel pouze pridana karta, pokus o zaplaceni selhal. Stojan mimo provoz. Obsluha nema tuseni co s tim. Takze vysledek pro zakaznika je zdrzeni a frustrace. Hlavne, ze mate reklamu pres Google ADs, nejdriv si vyskolte vlastni lidi na cerpacich stanicich at vi co maji delat. Update 1.10.2021. Aplikace super, kvituji moznost dobijet v aplikaci primo TankEasy kartu. | Aplikace vypadá hezky, zdá se, že i funguje, ale chybí zásadní funkce, a to platba pomoci Google Pay, kterou konkurence podporuje. Do té doby pro jistou skupinu uživatelů je QR platba nepoužitelná. | Pohoda | Very good tool for payment at Benxina statios as well as for collection of rewards | Appka fungovala rok OK, před časem odmítla platbu, pak i platnou kartu, která nešla znovu přidat. Reinstalace, nová registrace, úspěšná registrace karty - výsledek platba zamítnuta. Víc už nemám chuť řešit. Třeba budete mít větší štěstí... | No offline mode (at least for displaying the QR code), slow start, camera was sometimes lagging. But otherwise useful for paying from car. | top platby z appky | Chyba 1004, po používání skoro týdně mi najednou nejde spustit aplikace | Congratulation Benzina, you created App which is not usable. I'm not possible to register. It still ends with message ""You are offline"". | Slouží dobře, ale neukazuje transakce za poslední 2 měsíce, to je znepokojující. Chybka...? Podpora píše, že se ukáží jen transakce provedené z aplikace (platba u stojanu). Po update zobrazuje zůstatek hned při startu - spokojenost. | Today, after update, app does not work. Internet connection check fails (""you are offline"") | Všechny porodní bolesti byly vychytány a vše funguje jak má...hned je tankování jednodušší :-). Ještě by to chtělo přehled pro business karty, aby člověk se dostal rovnou na portál a možnost odebrání Easy karty, když je tam i business. | Konečně! Dá se dobít kredit v aplikaci. Teď to nemá chybu. | Zamakali jste a nyní už můžu s klidem dát plný počet. Jen tak dál. | Paráda, všetko funguje | Už 5x jsem ověřil účet přes odkaz v emailu a stále se nejde přihlásit, stále mě aplikace žádá o ověření přes odkaz z emailu. | Dobíjení kreditů pomocí karty je konečně k dispozici! | Nefunguje přihlášení. Po přihlášení napíše, že je potřeba kliknout na link v emailu, ale po kliknutí na něj se pouze zobrazí chyba. Nejde se tak přihlásit. | Looks good and easy to use but unfortunately does not take BENEFIT/BUSINESS cards. | Great app. Very convenient to pay via QR code at the stand. Enjoyed it a lot with my easy tank card. Hope to see support for the benefit card as well some time soon 😉 | Mohlo by jít dobíjet přímo v aplikaci pomoci platební karty. | Konecne funguje platba Benzina kartou, co je jediny dovod instalovat tuto apku. Bohuzial, prevladol marketing nad zdravim rozumom. Stav na karte musite hladat niekde hlboko v menu. Namiesto toho, na uvodnej stranke mate nejaky blby stav Konikov. Inak apka robi co ma. Edited: stav karty uz je na homapage, takze menim na 5* | Po přidání podpory tank karty je aplikace super, takže měním hodnocení, funguje krásně i ve spojení s věrnostním programem. | Měním původní kritickou recenzi, sice to trvalo 2 roky, ale už jdou přidat tank-tank karty, lze vybrat čím platit, lze přidat i karty z jiného účtu. Víceméně vše důležité funguje.... Co by se dalo zlepšit - personifikace karet (popis nebo obrázek) aby člověk líp viděl, kterou kartou platí. | UPDATE: Můj návrh níže byl implementován. Moc si toho vážím, díky developerům.-KONEC UPDATE- Aplikace je super, uvítal jsem zavedení možnosti platby zákaznickou Tankartou. Bylo by ale dobré, kdybych si mohl na obrazovce ""Domů"" zobrazit zůstatek na kartě. Je to pro mne důležitější údaj, než např. zůstatek koníků. Teď musím jít do přehledu karet, abych zjistil, kolik mi ještě zbývá. Jinak bez chyby. | Super! | Nakŕmil som aplikáciu PINom, otiskom prsta, emailom, heslom, telefónnym číslom a potom mi oznámila že BUSINESS kartu pridať nevie. | Parádní aplikace a jeden z důvodů proč rád tankuji na Benzině. Placení Tank Kartou či platební kartou je super easy a tak rychlé až se občas divím, že za mnou nevyběhne obsluha kvůli odjíždění bez placení :) Chybí mi ještě dobíjení Tank Karty v appce a zobrazení cen pohonných hmot. Aplikaci oceníte nejvíce na Benzina Expres (kde nepochodíte bez fyzické platební karty) a také že nemusíte dovnitř s rouškou na klasických pumpách. | Super appka, používám neustale, dovnitr jdu pouze na vyzvednutí odměny za koniky. Nicméně mi chybi jedna věc - možnost dobití karty skrz aplikaci, i kdyby tam byly údaje k bankovnímu převodu, když by nešlo online dobití kartou, takhle znechuceně hledám na webovkach. Jakmile přidáte tuto možnost, hned mrsknu 5 hvězd, nemam co vytknout | Good app. Really appreciate to be able to pay without having to go inside the statuon. However, it is a pity that I cannot link my Benzina card to benefit from discounts. Isn't it strange that the Benzina app discourages using the Benzina card? | Spojení s tankart dobré, leč nedotažené k úplné dokonalosti. Pokud na android zařízení použiji dark mode, nedaří se čtečce načíst barcode. | smart app, easy to use. I recommend | Nápad s používáním karty je dobrý, aplikace funguje bez problémů. Je ale škoda, že tzv koníci nejsou načítáni i při pouhém placení kartou tank easy na pokladně. To je nedořešené otravovat obsluhu pro připsání. Rovněž ""dobíjení kreditu"" by mohlo být spojené třeba s virtuální peněženkou na telefonu a finance by mohly být na Tank Easy kartě hned. Jinak je převod minimálně 24h a musí se dobíjet zase na pokladně. | Aplikace podporuje Tank karty :)))) | Neplanujete přidat podporu Google pay namísto nutnosti ukládat si kartu do aplikace? | Bohužel aplikace tvrdí že jde platit tank-kartou easy. Není to pravda. Kartu mam nahranou do aplikace. Dnes jsem chtěl zaplatit u tankovaciho stojanu a nebylo možné v aplikaci tank-kartu vybrat a použít k placení. *************** Edit: kontaktovan helpdesk a vše uz funguje jak má ! | Poslední hvězdička přibude, když se bude dát easy karta ""nabít"" v apce. S tím něco udělejte, když už tam mám nahranou platební kartu. | Neuvěřitelné pomalé! 13.11.20 Nyní už funguje jak má. | Funguje bez problémů. Na placení od stojanu a navíc s využitím tank karty se snadno zvyká. | Super aplikace, urychlí tankování. | Přihlášení do účtu nefunguje. Není jasné jak přidat tank kartu. | Po poslední aktualizaci bylo placení dost nepřehledné - oproti klasickému naskenovaní kódu u stojanu jsem musel znovu zadávat kartu (a kdyby se nenosily roušky, šel bych k pokladně). I po přihlášení otiskem je v aplikaci tlačítko přihlásit/registrovat. Update: nejde mi přidat karta, píše to Bankovní karta s číslem *** byla odebrána pro překročení limitu počtu přidaných karet. | Zvyšuji na 2*. Za možnošt připojení TankKarty, ale jinak je stále na čem pracovat. Aplikace má problém s přihlášením k účtu. Někdy to trvá velmi dlouho a někdy to nejde vůbec (ohlásí to výpadek). Tajně jsem doufal, že bude možné dobíjet TankKartu v aplikaci přes platební bránu pomocí platební karty. Nejde to bohužel ani na webu. Převod z účtu je na houby, než se to připíše do účtu TankKarty trvá to nesmyslně dlouho. Tedy stále TankKarta = chození na pokladnu. Je to škoda. | Almost not usable for a week almost. Extremely slow, my cards have disappeared | K platební kartě nelze přidat ""přezdívka"" nebo vlastní označení pro jednoduché rozpoznání několika platebních karet. | Aplikaci jsem zatím bohužel nepoužil ani jednou. Hlavně chybí již tolikrát zmiňovaná integrace TankKarty. Mapa čerpacích stanic a aktuální ceny pohonných hmot by byly taky super. Zatím tedy pěkně k pokladně. Update 23.9.2020: Tak jsem se po roce těšil na intergraci tank karty, ale když se chci přihlásit, tak mi aplikace napíše chyba 1500 a to je vše. Už bych vám chtěl dát více hvězdiček :) Update 25.9.2020: Dobrý den, bohužel ani po updatu aplikace chyba 1500 při znaze o přihlášení nezmizela. Update 20.10.2020: Po delší době jsem zkusil přihlášení a již funguje. Přidávám hvězdičku a po vyzkoušení platby přes TankKartu v aplikaci přibudou další :) Update 23.10.2020: Dneska jsem konečně vyzkoušel platbu u stojanu přes aplikaci s TankKartou. Všechno v pohodě, sleva se uplatila :) Dávám čtyři hvezdičky. Dal bych pět, ale na webu jsem si zablokoval jednu kartu a stav se do aplikace ani po několika hodinách nepřenesl. | Pres obchodni podminky o 1000 radcich jsem se nedostal. TL;DR Cenu benzinu na stanicich se zrejme take nedozvim. Nemam zajem. | Chybi mi možnost dobiti tank karty online platebni kartou. | Parádní aplikace, díky za přidání tank karty teď už je perfektní. | Funguje v pořádku, rychle. Nemusela by tak vehementně cpát registraci, když jde fungovat i bez ní. Účtenka nejde přes Share uložit do Google Drive, což by se hodilo kvůli účetnictví (nebo prostě nemít soubory v telefonu). Also, Google Pay? :) | Bohužel neexistuje možnost dobití z aplikace | Not working after update. | Update 2:Aplikace se již zapne. Přihlásit se stále nešlo. Opakovaně jsem se zkoušel přihlásit a kliknout na potvrzení v mailu. Vždy to prý proběhlo v pořádku, ale aplikace stále chtěla znovu ověřovat mail. Když jsem zkusil otevřít email na telefonu a ne PC, už to šlo. Další problém je hned u přidání fyzické tank karty easy, kdy pořád vyskakuje chyba 50042. Navíc, na webu ani nejdou změnit údaje v profilu - ""Při komunikaci se serverem nastala chyba"". Už opravdu dost ztrácím zájem o tento produkt. | Finaly Tank Karta support! Works great, thanks! | Very helpful, use it on every refueling. No queues, especially these covid days.. Card hold stays way too long though. | I would love to use this app. However, it does not support the Tank Karta, so I cannot. | Přikláním se k názoru, prostě přidat slevu kterou dostanete platbou tank kartou, ke platbam prostřednictvím aplikace. Stejně celá myšlenka tank karty je jak z minulého století. Přijdu na kasu, nabiju kartu normální kartou a zaplatím tank kartou... | Když je pro vás přidání tank karty takový problém, vykašlete se na ni a místo toho prostě při platbě touto apkou dejte stejnou slevu jako při platbě tank kartou. Jediný důvod proč tu kartu mám je ta sleva, tak bych prostě místo karty používal apku. Easy squeezy a nestojí vás to nic na vývoji apky. | Myšlenka super, ale nepodporuje vernostní kartu (placení, dobijení kreditu). | Tank karta stale v nedohlednu, stale zapomina ulozenou platebni kartu.. kdyz zrovna funguje tak ok, ale kdyz pri kazdem pouziti musite znovu pridavat platebni kartu tak to se fakt pouzivat neda.. behem karanteny to bylo fajn. Clovek nemusel od auta a potkat se s pumparkou.. ale v soucasne chvili tahle vyhoda mizi.. | Aplikace stoji naprosto za nic, tedy konkrétně platby v aplikaci. Pokud zadáte částku pro tankování, řekněme 2000kc ale máte na účtu v tu chvíli pouze 1999kc, aplikace na uctu vyblokuje celou částku tedy 1999kc ovsem nedovolí vás natankovat ani litr. Toto se mi stalo opakovaně. Aktuálně mi Benzina takto dluží cca 1200kc. Edit: jednalo se o Benzinu express, tedy o stojany v Poděbradech kde je třeba nejdříve ""zaplatit"" a potom tankovat. | Platit QRkem je pěkné, ale dokud nebude aplikace umět tank kartu tak stejně musím chodit na pokladnu | Nepodporuje benzina kartu ani pre platbu a ani k uplatneniu zľavy za tankovanie - aktuálne nepoužiteľné. | Od doby, kdy app vyzaduje pri placeni zapnute GPS se z platby stala nocni mura. Telefon ktery nema v aute zaplou gps se pod strechou cerpacek s GPS tezko spojuje a z placeni se stava zdlouhava neprijemnost. | Až bude fungovat Tank Karta, dám plné hodnocení. Ani po roce a půl není implementována tank karta, takže dávám nejnižší hodnocení. | Neumožňuje platbu kartou benzina a neobsahuje ani ceny PHM, appka má teda nulovú pridanú hodnotu a pre verného zákazníka je nevyužiteľná. Edit: Sľuby o pridani možnosti platby kartou Benzina trvajú moc moc dlho, a stále je to ""zanedlho"". | Chybí propojení s dobíjecí kartou Benzina | Slibný začátek, ale ještě Vás čeká velká spousta práce, pro začátek aktuální informace o cenách na ČP by nemusel být tak velký challenge, pak přidání tank karty, nebo alespoň přehledu o zůstatku a možnost si dobít z již přidané karty | Zbytečná aplikace, protože nelze spojit s tank kartou. Tzn žádná sleva na palivo. | Good idea but still promising final solution. No possibility to use Tank karta, which is still described as 'to be done'. So the question is when do you plan to implement also Tank karta into this app? Tx. | Nelze spojit s Benzina kartou ani neposkytuje slevu na palivo.(kromě promo akce na verva diesel). | Benzina v Suchdole nefunguje, apka ji nabizi jako jine neexistujici Banziny, prosim o opravu Účty by bylo dobre mit moznost odeslat za kvartal, kdyz se dela DPH, dejte tam prosim skupinovy vyber a odeslani/ulozeni (do telefonu to nejde) at to neposilam po jedne... diky David | Nelze přidat tank kartu, takže zbytečné. | Aktualizace hodnocení po opravě chyb. Přetrvává nemožnost sparovat s kartou Benzina a nefunguje v PL. | Nyni jiz funguje. | Nefungovala a zrovna nebrali karty, musel jsem si jit vybrat hotovost.... | aplikace po spusteni napise Jste offlne a nelze ji tak pouzivat. Pripojeni k internetu mam (apka nefunguje ani na wifi, ani primo pres data), chyba na vice typech mobilu. | Just downloaded the app and seems a promising one, if functionality is kept up to the exigencies of such a modernizing vision. Also, it avoids us having to face some of your cashiers, who are not always welcoming at all, with their locked up faces & attitudes. Other thing that would be a revolution is partnering with other payments options & companies, like Sodexo which offers cafeteria Account to employers for their staff. This pays in spa, gym & other places, besides food Acct, why not fuel. | Marketak od benziny tu robi zlu reklamu. Tvrdit platte kartou cez appku sice bez zlavy ale za to o par sekund rychlejsie nedava zmysel. (update) Trva vam to dlho. Privelmi(update) Teraz vie aplikacia vyhladat benzina cerpacie stanice na ktorych nemozete platit benzina kartou z appky (rozumej vsetky). | Tak máme začátek února a platby tank kartou nebo sleva přes appku stále nic... Tomu říkám ""co nejdříve""... EDIT: máme listopad a hádejte co se změnilo? Nic, i ty sliby jsou pořád stejně plané... | Bez pridania tank karty nepoužiteľné. | Nepodporuje vlastní kartu. Nepochopitelné. | Aplikace funguje jak je slibováno. Vítám systém placení až po natankování. Oproti konkurenčnímu řešení kde se blokuje částka je toto daleko lepší. Mám ale 2 výtky - 1.) Ne všechny čerpací stanice podporují Benzina platby a byl bych rád za nějaký seznam kde je platba tímto způsobem dostupná a tu bych v daném městě mohl upřednostnit. 2.) Zbavte se prosím těch UI prvků z iOS od Applu, především vyskakovacích nabídek a podobně - Material design Androidu je fajn tak proč ho nepoužít. Díky! | Pro běžné platby vypadá hezky, pro věrné klienty, kteří používají TankKartu je to k ničemu. Jakmile přijde verze s podporou TankKarty, pak to bude výborná aplikace. Kdy to ale bude? | Jak jste daleko s přidáním té Tank karty? | It's a great app but It's missing 2 critical features. It needs to support TankKarta and Google Pay | Nepodporuje platby Benzina Tank kartou - nepochopitelne, nepouzitelne. | Načo aplikácia, keď neumožňuje pridať benzina kartu :( | if the security code can only be numbers,why doest the input field open qwertz keyboard? i had to take my gloves off because of this..but overal the experience was better than queuing for 10 minutes behind people ordering food... | Its f... Miserable apps,very agresive advert,jumping on my smart screen loudly.Downlowding only to give a negative rate and will be deleted now.Hope is not going back like bad penny.I just cant believed,this advert went again on my screen.It looks like only way is get this fu.. Apps and give a bad rate.Its bloody sh...t.Hope I will never hear again about stupid Benzina. | Nemusim kvuli placeni chodit od stojanu. Super! | Stáhl jsem si dneska při tankování. Super, že je možné platit hned u stojanu, ale nevím, jestli mi aplikace vystaví daňový doklad do účetnictví. Umí to nebo ne? Bez toho by to bylo k ničemu. Ptal jsem se na to hned u pokladny Benziny pán řekl, že vůbec neví, že se ho na to nikdo neptal. Čekal bych proškolenější personál, když se to tak propaguje. Díky za odpověď. | Bez možnosti platby tank kartou je to aplikace naprosto k ničemu. Ve srovnání s ostatními systémy mobilních plateb chudý příbuzný. Nechápu, že do něčeho takového někdo vůbec vrazil peníze na vývoj. | Bohužel, bez podpory TankKarty k ničemu. Vlastní produkt by měl být podporován na prvním místě | Aplikace je fajn, ale je co zlepšovat. Ocenil bych přidání tank-karty do aplikace + platby tank kartou. Samozřejmě bych také ocenil dobíjení tank karty v aplikaci. Edit recenze: Tank - karta nikde, aplikace k ničemu. Už je to strašná doba!!! | Je to dobré. ALE přijedu ke stojanu chci zaplatit,  naskenuju kód a řekne to, že je aplikace zastaralá a že mám smůlu. Doma ji aktualizuju, pak s ní jednou zaplatím a při příštím placení už zase nezaplatím, protože zase zastarala :( Takže je to skvělé. Jsem  Váš fanda, jen to prosím vylaďte ať se s tím dá platit :) ...    Plus můžete mě vysvětlit, jak velký je problém udržet zpětně kompatibilní api, které pošle jeden krátký String s QR kódem (vím, že tam toho je trochu víc, ale pořád mě to připadá dost jednoduché)  Placení zdar :) | Původně spokojenost, ale poslední dvě tankování mi aplikace hlásí, že je zastaralá. Aktualizace na gplay ale není k dispozici. Takže se dostavilo zklamání... | Myšlenka je hezká, ale aplikace mi ani nejde spustit, buď jen černá obrazovka, nebo se mi zobrazí logo a dál nic. / Doplnění: Toto byla první instalace. Nepomohlo ani nainstalovat znova, ani smazat data aplikace. Mám Android 8.1.0. | Luxusní záležitost, nemusim nikam chodit, zaplatim rychle u srojanu, nebo z auta. vylepsil bych reseni prechodu z expirujici karty na novou. | Bez Benzina Karty je aplikace k ničemu. | Proc neni aplikace propojena s GooglePay? Clovek si nainstaluje aplikaci a pak musi zadat udaje o karte, kterou uz ma jednou ulozenou v mobilu (GooglePay)? | Aplikace nejde spustit ... | Without TankKarta support this app is completely useless for me. | Tank Karta chybí. Slibují její integraci už půl roku. Nic. Když už jsem přinucený vložit na účet prostředky a tím se zavázat k jejich útratě u Vás, zasloužím si víc než jen sliby. | Stale nejde platit pres benzina kartu.. dokud to nepujde, nepouzitelne.. | Aplikace nepracuje s tankkartou a neumožňuje využít její slevu, pro stálé zákazníky tedy nepoužitelná, dále chybí podpora Masterpass, Google play, nebo aspoň naskenování karty. Update 10.5: Po půl roce ani jedna aktualizace, kdy bude slibovaná Tank karta Easy? | Bez moznosti nacteni slevovych karet bezcenna aplikace. | Využití Tankkarty je zásadní věc, která této aplikaci chybí. Nápad je to dobrý a jednoduchý, určitě bych přidával další jednoduché funkce. Stojí za vyzkoušení ale ještě je na ní hodně práce. | Stále bez Tank karty a navigace k pumpě? Další zcela zbytečná aplikace nebo zcela neschopní vývojáři. Každý prostě dnes musí rychle mít svou ""appku"", i kdyby mu její totální zbytečnost měla zničit renomé. EDIT: Není podstatné, jak revoluční vnímáte vaší ""aplikaci"" vy, ale uživatelé. Až na tuto malou nuanci přijdete, možná nebudete ""nové funkce"" jen měsíce plánovat, ale budete je i implementovat. | Dobrý den, kdy bude aplikace podporovat tank kartu? | uzasna a uzitecna app. dekuju tvurci za pouzivani rozumu. | nápad hezký, ale nepodporuje tankkartu, chybí mapa benzínek např. s uvedenými cenami za pohonné hmoty :( zatím jsem nepoužil aplikaci ani jednou, protože to pro mě není dostatečně zajímavé | It's fine, but use Masterpass to pay. | naprosto skvělé!.... ale proboha, dejte tam mapu benzin, vždyť je to tak jednoduché a posune to tu aplikaci o několik levelů výš😉 | Velmi spatny nebo zadny pruzkum trhu, ktery neodhalil nejcasejsi use case tj. placeni Tank kartou a navic neschopnost pridat tuto moznost v ramci nekolika mesicu. Po mem uvodnim nadseni bohuzel velke zklamani, ani jednou jsem appku nevyuzil, skoda | Super aplikace, prvni zaplacení na pumpě bylo subjektivně hladší než u masterpass. Jsem překvapený z negativních recenzí, appka je z 99% hotová a na první verzi velmi vyladena, doporucil bych proste započítat body z věrnostni karty nejak zpětně. Jediná vytka je k umístění kodu na stojanu ve Vysokém Myte. Dal bych ho tak, aby při zastavení byl stojan u vika nádrže a QR kod u dveří řidiče, abych v zimě a dešti nemusel skenovat venku. Hodilo by se mit možnost poznacit si k tankovani stav tachomeru | Proč? Nelze použít tank kartu pro slevu. Nelze použít uložené karty v google pay. Služba je vlastně mizerná analogie Masterpass kterým lze platit u Shellu. Ke konci roku 18 je stále pouze 1. vydání aplikace z října. S tím že na tom pracují. | Chybi podpora benzina tankkarty. Tudiz itak se musi jit zaplatit do fronty | Vyzkoušel jsem a jsem spokojen.  Tady je pár poznámek, jak by šlo aplikaci vylepšit:  1) Doma jsem zaregistroval kartu, ale když jsem chtěl poprvé zaplatit, tak nenaběhla obrazovka pro skenování QR kodu. Celá aplikace se zasekla (telefon SGS 9). I podruhé, i potřetí, pak jsem zaplatil raději na pokladně a po příchodu do auta jsem zkusil přejít na skenování znovu. Teprve při tomto pokusu si aplikace vyžádala právo pořizovat foto. Možná by stálo za to nastavit práva ihned po úvodní registraci karty (nebo na to uživatele alespoň upozornit).  2) Jak psali i další lidé přede mnou, nedovedu si moc představit, že všechny firmy budou mít své unikátní mobilní aplikace pro placení zboží/služeb. A uživatel poté, co změní telefon, tak budete znovu a znovu  ve všech aplikacích registrovat karty. Vhodnější by bylo umožnit platit pomocí Google Pay, MasterPassu apod. | Mohli jste mít nadšeného zákazníka, ale raději budu dále chodit na pokladnu. V mnoha zemích světa celkem běžný koncept jak platit za benzín a šetřit čas. Proč proboha má ta aplikace 30Mb a co se děje na pozadí? Často i několik sekund odezva na povel. Než bych to naklikal, tak jsem i s čekáním ve frontě venku rychleji. Škoda. | Chybi nejdůležitější funkcionality - tankkarta a masterpass. To je asi jako koupit si auto bez volantu a brzd... hlavně že kola to má. Nekdo nezanalyzoval co klient skutečně potřebuje. | Moc nerozumím tomu proč aplikace nevyužívá Google Pay, ale ok. To, že chybí Tank karta je další věc. Aktuálně aplikaci nepovažuji za užitečnou. | Neumí karty CCS. | Pokud ma byt pro stale zakazniky Benziny (coz bych rekl, ze urcite, proc si ji jinak instalovat kvuli jedne platbe), tak MUSI umet vyuzit slevy z Tankkarty. Jinak nechapu jeji smysl | nepodporuje tankkartu, to je smutné | Rychlá a intuitivní appka.

This pays in spa, gym & other places, besides food Acct, why not fuel."",""No offline mode (at least for displaying the QR code), slow start, camera was sometimes lagging. But otherwise useful for paying from car."",""if the security code can only be numbers,why doest the input field open qwertz keyboard? i had to take my gloves off because of this..but overal the experience was better than queuing for 10 minutes behind people ordering food..."",""Good idea but still promising final solution. No possibility to use Tank karta, which is still described as 'to be done'. So the question is when do you plan to implement also Tank karta into this app?

For example, when reseting password, you need to enter the email multipple times, and once you reset the password, you need to login again for no reason at all. Furthermore, if you decide not to grant the app notification permission it keeps throwing annoying popups. | Constantly asks for notification permissions evem after declining. It's more annoying than 2000s popups and pop unders combined, no hyperbole | Prosím, aplikace se nepotřebuje ptát každých 10 sekund, jestli nechci zapnout notifikace. | I lost taste when i looked at the app. | Lousy app with bad UX and no real benefits. | couldn't order, it gave me some error. just gonna use foodora | Stupid login form. Make it accept all google password Manager suggested strong password with automatic pickup of the username. Validate entries immediately, not after you click the submit button (so you have to press it twice). After account/email verif link click, make the user automatically logged in so they can continue with payment. | Pokud v aplikaci zvolím možnost jídla s sebou, ale v posledním kroku při placení vyberu vyzvednutí připraveného jídla v restauraci, tak mi obsluha kvůli automaticky vložené poznámce ""At restaurant"" vždy připraví jídlo na konzumaci přímo v restauraci a ne s sebou. Pak z toho jsou zbytečně situace nepříjemné pro všechny, kdy si každá strana pultu myslí, že problém stojí přímo naproti němu. Já vím, že jsem v aplikaci zvolil jídlo s sebou, obsluha vidí ""At restaurant""... Tohle by chtělo opravit. | Notifikace každý druhy den, co si dám k obedu a teď jsem si chtěl v restauraci i.p.pavlova skrze aplikaci objednat a nabízí mi to nejdřívější mozsnot vyzvednutí za 30 minut. Tak to je fakt haluz | Very disappointed, pop-up adds constantly spam you. Inconsistent setting of delivery time for your order (got an order canceled because I didn't pick it up in time, even though I set different delivery time inside the app) | proč 5x za objednávku vyskakuje okno s vynucovanim notifikaci?? | nadblbejsi kupony. Moc moc spatny kfc | Cold french fries | Inhuman experience | Idk why I often have demonstrations in my area... let me check... oh there are none. So how the hell does KFC think there are any. Other than that, it works well. | Aplikace neustále vyžaduje zapnutí notifikaci i když jsem aplikaci netifikace dávno povolil. Neskutečně otravné 5x odklikávat popup pokaždé když si chci něco objednat | Terrible user experience.. required to select restaurant for menu and login doesnt work 50% of the time... | Aplikace pořád otravuje, že chce posílat notifikace. Ne, nedám vám práva mě spamovat na telefonu, já chci jen nakoupit rychle a pohodlně. To nejde, když 3x během nakupu zavírám hlášku s notifikacemi. | It isn't the only app nowadays that may logout you and you.. don't remember of cause your password. | velmi mi to chutná 5/5 perfektní | stupid app constantly logs out me and block my account | ! Cb .f | Tato aplikace je totální průšvih - nedokáže mi nabídnout objednávku dřív, než za hodinu (u okénka čekám reálně minuty), a ani tu nedokáže provést, protože nonstop pobočka je prý zavřená. Opakovaně jsem se rozčílil, appku mažu, vaše pokusy fungovat na úrovni 21. století selhaly. | It keeps asking about notifications and wants to use your location all the time. The app just tries its best to be annoying and you have to make additional effort to avoid this stuff. | works ok, howevere it keeps logging me out after update | Ok for deliveries, but for pick-up useless. Would need to wait for an hour for my order. | дрочибельно | the application is not showing my exact address, so it needs to be more precise. | I've been trying to register but it's not working at all. Resetting my password or creating a new account, both are not working. Very frustrating... | Fail... No, i do not want to allow notifications, stop asking every 60s. Uninstalled. | Příšerná zkušenost-KFC zrušilo on-line objednávku a doporučilo objednat druhou-identickou, s tím, že se sice musí zaplatit obě ale dojde k vrácení penez. To se nikdy nestalo,ani po desítkách telefonátech s call centrem. Vždy ty samé lži o zavolání zpátky a vyřešení. Nikdy se již nikdo neozval. V současnosti probíhá příprava žaloby - trestního oznámení z důvodu podezření z neoprávněného obohacení a podezření z trestného činu podvodu. Dále byl podán podnět na obchodní inspekci. Nedoporučuji! 0/10 | the delivery discount coupons are always not available eventough the original vebsite is advertising cupons :( | I am sorry, but no veg or vegetarian food. Apologies! 🙏🏼🪷❤️🌌 | Stupid app to find the address, and says come and pick up at the store, if I could I would come, that's why I installed this stupid app. | Kupony nefunguji, ani pri rucnim zadani na kiosku | Buggy, doesn't even have a checkbox to accept terms of coupons... | Each time I read in the news a restaurant complaining that a delivery service takes their money for nothing, I remember AmRest that delays orders on 30 minutes on average, misplaces the orders completely and has the worst customer support that doesn't solve your problems and literally steals your money for nothing. Czech KFC, PizzaHut and BurgerKing apps are a literal scam and I don't know how they are still allowed here. | Vybral možnost S sebou. Nejen, že mi to dali tam, ale na celkem 12 stripsů mi dali jeden B-smat boxík, nechali mě si to zabalit a když jsem chtěl tašku, tak mi za ni naúčtovali 5 korun 😭😭 | App will Not work. KFC app sucks. | Při zvolení objednávky ""to go"" je objednávka vždy nachystaná k odběru v restauraci na tácku a ne zabalená. Štve to obsluhu i zákazníka.. | Po aktualizaci nefunguje rozlišení tady a sebou. Způsobuje to nepříjemnosti pro obsluhu i zákazníky. Nechápu jaký je problém přidat funkcionalitu pro započtení ceny tašky, když uz ji tedy uctujete. | Bohužel dovolí objednat do zavřené restaurace | Worst food ordering app I have ever used! | Podle manuálu od T-Mobile nejde aktivovat pouze nabídku 15 strips za 200. Je potřeba zadat jinou položku a uplatnit kód. A podle T-Mobile stačí pak onu položku odebrat. Ale pakliže odeberu položku košík se smaže celý. Možná by bylo jednodušší uplatnit kód u kasy. Ale to bohužel možné není. | Tohle zas musela vyvíjet nějaká super guma. | To many turns and curves! Makes it hard to navigate and order. They want more info than they need! | Not user friendly and worse coupons ever | The app is quite clean and nice, unfortunately so clean that you can't turn off the notifications about news and deals, which is really annoying and it's the reason why I gave only 2* (turning off notificatios for this app in phone settings isn't an option, because then you cannot see the order notification) | Coupons never chance, same things for months. | Objednali jsme jídlo, které bylo doručeno po 3 hodině v noci, podpora nebyla dostupná, chladné, nepoužitelné kousky kuřete, za to už měsíc nemám vrácené peníze ... | prehledna aktualizace | The app is very easy to navigate through and it looks very stylish, the food is more often than not on time and and is cooked perfectly so 5 stars from me, very satisfied | the worst app on play store, anything dont work properly | Po novom kupóny, jediná vec kolu ktorej si niekto tento odpad inštaluje, vyžaduje aby ste im dali mail a mohli vás spamovať. | I didn't get my 3 free wings but ima get my sandwich | I want coupon to use in the store not book my food from the app | mekac je lepsi ngl | Nepreskocitelne reklamy, radši objednám přes Wolt kde to je přehlednější a podstatě levnější, tohle se KFC fakt nepovedlo | Хорошая | We got food 45min later than pre-ordered time from app. Restaurant somehow not registered our order. We got meal as the last one | Během objednávky jsem zadal, že chci vyzvednout jídlo až za dvacet minut, neboť jsem byl na cestě. Po zaplacení mi ale aplikace ukázala, že jsem objednal na okamžité vyzvednutí.. jídlo jsem si tedy logicky nestihl vyzvednout a v aplikaci jsem mohl stornovat objednávku jen přes volání. | I love fried chicken | Ok | Does not know my address. | Otevřu aplikaci, zobrazím si kupóny a obsluha řekne, že nejsou aktivní. edit: opraveno | Bydlím 15 minut od kfc (Roztoky u Prahy) ale dovoz není možný naopak mě to popuzuje at jedu do Prahy i přes zákaz.. | There is no option to remove saved credit card. | Ordering can't be more chaotic. | Mel jsem 15 minut na jidlo ve meste. KFC jakoze zavreny, ale pred nim fronta kuryru. Ze pry jde objednat pickup. Ok. Zkusim. Instalnulnjsem app, natukal objednavku, pak Order and pay... A vyfakovalo mne to, ze to chce telefon a email. Ok, telefon jsem zadal, hnedka prisel nejakej kod, ale nebylo kam ho zadat. Pry jsem pak mel pockat na overujici email (omg, proc chcete na jednorazovou objednavku email, kdyz uznjste mne overili pres phone?), ale ten proste v tech 15 minutach neprisel, takze fail | Idiotic order and pickup implementation. Order will switch to ""has been picked up"" status, hiding the number at pikup time, even when I did not take it yet. Keep showing the number or handle this status correctly. | Zmatené | Cannot cancel or modify order through app... have to call which is a nuisance with all the background noise it is difficult to hear and convey the proper information | Nice app | Good app | Nice | Works as advertised again. | Useless. Just a same few coupons for many months. | No coupons or deals. Worthless app | Update rozbil aplikaci. Update nejde provést a při pokusu o reinstal instalace skončí chybou. | Not working, top complicated. | Aplikaci psali asi nějací opilí studenti. Vždyť je všechno špatně. A angličtinu překládal asi nějakej negramotnej. | Některé položky hlásí ""Not available in your localization"" což chápu jako, že toto není dostupné pokud je aplikace v angličtině. Tak proč sakra není možné jazyk aplikace změnit?! Aplikace automaticky použila angličtinu, protože mám android v angličtině, ani se nezeptá a ani nedá možnost to změnit.

I could swear I entered everything right but still ended up with order at the wrong place and time, wasting money.

"Google Authenticator","Google Authenticator adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by adding a second step of verification when you sign in.
This means that in addition to your password, you'll also need to enter a code that is generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone.

The verification code can be generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone, even if you don't have a network or cellular connection.

* Sync your Authenticator codes to your Google Account and across your devices. This way, you can always access them even if you lose your phone.
* Set up your Authenticator accounts automatically with a QR code. This is quick and easy, and it helps to ensure that your codes are set up correctly.
* Support for multiple accounts. You can use the Authenticator app to manage multiple accounts, so you don't have to switch between apps every time you need to sign in.
* Support for time-based and counter-based code generation. You can choose the type of code generation that best suits your needs.
* Transfer accounts between devices with a QR code. This is a convenient way to move your accounts to a new device.
* To use Google Authenticator with Google, you need to enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account. To get started visit http://www.google.com/2step

Lacking in a lot of features and it's a pain trying to migrate to a different app. I switched to Aegis Authenticator and it was the best decision I ever made. Took a while to switch my accounts to Aegis thanks to Google not allowing you to export to other apps, but no regrets."",""Was fine for over a year then all of a sudden my codes won't work on any website I use it for. I tried syncing but it keeps telling me \""it appears to be synced already.\"" I made sure it was updated. I transferred it from one email to another and I was able to log in to one account. Tried logging into the same account again and couldn't do it. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixed it for now but I'm not optimistic."",""It's better than it used to be as it now has a backup option. One big issue is there is no password needed when opening the app . If your phone is stolen whilst unlocked which does happen . The thief will keep the screen unlocked and will be able to view all the codes in the app. I've also tested the export option with 12 codes in the app. This gives you 2 QR codes to scan . Scanning them didn't work as an error message came up saying something like 'invalid code'. I tried this twice."",""Update...still no fix for the issue below. Little point in having the clock counting down when users have to manually refresh Used to be great but now it doesn't auto-refresh when clock has counted down. This means that, occasionally, I enter an incorrect code when logging in to some sites. Rather annoying. Seems this has been an issue for some people for quite some time (at least 10 months).""]",false,false,false,"com.google.android.apps.authenticator2","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Prosím o opravu... | Absolutely useless outside of CR | je vetsi pravděpodobnost ze vyhraju v loterii nez ze se mi aplikace nacte:D u 10 pokusu se obcas nacte 1x, nebo 2x ale treba vubec. takze jsem odkazana na webovou verzi, coz neni tak velika komplikace, ale cekala bych, ze kdy existuje aplikace, tak alespoň bude funkční a ulehci tim tak sledování, asi ne xd | Asi 98% s toho je premium co znamna ze je to za penize 😔 | Forced ads before live stream which contains another ads....seriously?!?! | I live in UK and would like to watch , when i try to pay for premium the page is just loading for ages and will not let me pay ... what do i do please ? | Mam problemy s platinum premium kdyz so zvolim chci premium tak mi to nacita a nacita a na platbu mi to nepusti zkousel jsem to asi 100 krat nejaka rada? Dekuji | nefunguje,nejde spustit nic.. | Poslední aktualizace už fungují i na Androidu 13. | Don't like | aplikace je docela dobra, akorat me stve ze treba u Ghost adventures chybí díly, dříve když bylo iprima tak tam byli všechny díly a ted tam je u každé série jen jeden nebo dva díly, takze davam jen 2 Hvezdicky | Nádhera! Mnohem přehlednější 🤩 Doporučuji! | Otravny reklamy, ktery se pořád zasekavaji. Celkem by mi nevadili, kdyby fungovali. Měli by to vyřešit pro jednou a pro vždy. | ""Obsah není dostupný ve Vaši lokalite"" Skoro nič nejde prehrať zo Slovenska. | Poslední aktualizace fakt na prd. Nefunguje, nelze spustit, proste nic. | Aplikace funguje s aktivním předplatným OK. Co mě ale štve je, že nefunguje na TV boxu s androidem 9 ani na chromacastu s android tv. Nechápu, proč to takhle omezujete. Pokud by mi aplikace kvůli kompatibilitě nefungovala, tak OK, ale ta šance je hodně malá. | Proč se musím přihlašovat? | Chápem, že reklamy sú v appke nutné a akceptujem ich, ale všetko by sa malo robiť s mierou. Niektoré reklamy na konci zastanú, obraz zamrzne a nejdeš sa z toho dostať. Inokedy sa prehráva 5 reklám a cca 10 sekúnd programu, zase 5 reklám a opäť tých istých 10 sekúnd programu a tak dookola. Už som raz appku odinštalovala a v nádeji, že na nej nejakí vývojári pracujú a vylepšujú 'glitches', som ju nainštalovala zase. Ale mám len jedny nervy. | Půl hodiny jsme strávili tím, že jsme se snažili všemi možnými způsoby přihlásit na TV. K čemu si to platíme? Už z principu za všechno, co Prima v poslední době dělá, se jí snažíme moc nepouštět. | Bez podpory AndroidTV, chyba. | Koki | Beru to zpět, stabilní to vůbec není, pustím si pořad nebo seriál běží v pohodě, pak přijde reklama jo to je normální jenže reklama doběží a pak se to stopne a nejede to a musím to resetovat a pořad si pustit znovu!! A mně to fakt nebaví.. Chtělo by to doladit hlavně tuhle chybu aplikace tedy vůbec stabilní a funkční není, má nějaké chyby furt | Zbytecna apka. Reklamy, reklamy a zase jen reklamy. Nic jineho, normalni TV v tom pustit nesla. Odinstalovano. | Jako jede vše docela dobře, ale třeba reklamy by se mohly přehrávat až po odeslání do Chromecastu. Takto si tam chci něco poslat a musím se podívat na reklamy v mobilu a pak až odeslat do Chromecastu. Nevim ano, jestli funguje autoplay na Chromecast na další epizody. V aplikaci chybí na hlavní obrazovce nějaká nabídka nedodívaného videa nebo další epizody, pokud je to seriál. | Sice není jako apka na android tv, ale naprosto perfektně mi funguje na chromecast posílání, takže za mě skvělé. Hlavně s tím proboha nic v budoucnu nevymýšlejte :D Takové to uděláme skvělý modernější update, kdy polovina funkcí umře :D (Plus oceňuji, že si můžu pořád vybrat, jestli budu platit předplatné nebo čučet na reklamy. Občas koupím předplatné, když toho začnu sledovat víc a už mě ty reklamy nebaví, občas holt reklamy.) | Great 👍 | Byla by super podpora Android TV | nepřehledná aplikace - hledání diskuzního pořadu, který běžel jen před dvěma hodinami, je něco jak lovení králíka z klobouku (pořad najdete jen s trochou štěstí a trpělivosti). Zcela nepochopitelně aplikace nefunguje přes LAN (tv-box). | Předchozí appka byla mnohem srozumitelnějsi. Tohle pořád padá. Znovu se načítá a neustále reklama i když být nemá. | Proc iprima neni dostupna v UK | Jako plus beru to, že aplikace ukazuje kolik reklam se zobrazí. A taky možnost sledování videí na výšku, je to příjemnější. Ale jako minus musím dát dlouhé načítání a nepřehlednost aplikace. Já třeba než jsem se dostal k Modrému Kódu, tak to trvalo deset minut, protože vyhledat mi to odmítlo. To by bylo potřeba doladit, ale jinak dobrý. A asi jenom ještě jedna ráda pro podporu. Zrušte možnost sledovat dříve než v televizi. | Otáčení obrazovky mám vyplé a přesto se obraz v aplikaci každou chvíli otočí a hned zas narovná aniž bych telefon natočil, během tohoto probliknutí vždy obraz zčerná a asi 5 vteřin je slyšet jen zvuk. Nastavte aby natáčení obrazovky fungovalo podle nastavení telefonu, ne zvlášť v aplikaci. Také někdy nereaguje tlačítko přeskočení reklamy a to je velmi otravné! | Aplikace je na prd,kvalita streamu 576p logo iPrimy a ne Primy a to se mi Nelíbí, chce to update | Polibte si elipsy s registraci | Kvuli memu problemu s prehravacem na webu (chybne napsana extenze) jsem nainstaloval tuhle app. Ale ta neni schopna ani vyhledat epizodu podle cisla ci popisu (fulltext) a nema zarigistrovane URL, takze nejde na webu vybrat ""otevrit v"", a tak sem musel prochazet stovky epizod, kdy kliknuti ""Dalsi"" docte jen asi 5. A po spusteni videa a shlednuti 3 reklam jsem zjistil, ze to byla jina serie a musel opet projit cisla od zacatku. Pro zachovani klidne psychiky jsem app radsi odinstaloval. | Kdyby to ty reklamy stale nezablokovavali tak bych dala 5 hvězd.Tohle je už vážně sila 🙄 | Ach ty reklamy Kdyz se zacnou prehravat reklamy tak to potom prestane hrat vubec. Ty to zablokoji a nejde s tim nic delat nez zacit znova dokud se to neopakuje. Nekdy porad nezacne vubec. | Aplikace často padá. Přehrávání se přeruší/pokazí při reklamě. Do pořadů je vloženo příliš mnoho reklamních bloků, a dlouhých, bez možnosti přeskočení po odpočtu. Chápu, že je nutné do pořadů reklamy vložit, ale pokud aplikace pořád padá, někdy kvůli reklamě, někdy sledujete jen reklamy...je to na prd. Ještě jednu důležitou chybu jsem objevil, pořád jsem nechápal, proč aplikace padá, když pohnu telefonem. Zřejmě je to v okamžiku, kdy se má překlopit obraz, tak místo toho aplikace spadne. | Nelze nic prehrat, stale rika, te nejsem pripojena k internetu. | Když funguje tak je dobrý. Ale v poslední době..září 2020.. krachuje. Nedovoli hrat koupené epizody. Instalovala jsem 2x znova. Moc to nepomohlo. Android. Samsung note9. Novy. Žádný jiny problém s podobným app nemám. Chybí na novém app oblíbené pořady. Nebo historie..... aktuální stav říjen 2020... je vidět že chyby byly opraveny. Děkuji :-) | Nejhorsi aplikace a sluzba vubec. Ucte se od jinych.

"Microsoft Teams","Whether you’re connecting with your community for an upcoming activity or working with teammates on a project, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has communities, events, chats, channels, meetings, storage, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect and manage access to information. Get your community, family, friends, or work mates together to accomplish tasks, share ideas, and make plans. Join audio and video calls in a secure setting, collaborate in documents, and store files and photos with built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. 

Easily connect with anyone: 
• Meet securely with communities, teammates, family, or friends.
• Set up a meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. 
• Chat 1-1 or to your entire community, @mention people in chats to get their attention. 
• Create a dedicated community to discuss specific topics and make plans*.
• Work closely and collaborate by keeping conversations organized by specific topics and projects with teams and channels.
• Video or audio call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to a call. 
• Use GIFs, emojis, and message animations to express yourself when words aren’t enough. 

Accomplish plans and projects together: 
• Send photos and videos in chats to quickly and easily share important moments.
• Use cloud storage to access shared documents and files on the go. 
• Organize shared content in a community — events, photos, links, files —so you don’t have to waste time searching*. 
• Get the most out of your meetings by using screenshare, whiteboard, or breakout in virtual rooms.
• Manage access to information and ensure the right people have access to the right info, even when people join and leave projects.
• Use task lists to stay on top of projects and plans - assign tasks, set due dates, and cross off items to keep everyone on the same page. 

Designed to give you peace of mind: 
• Securely collaborate with others while maintaining control over your data.
• Keep communities safe by allowing owners to remove inappropriate content or members*.
• Enterprise-level security and compliance you expect from Microsoft 365**.

How exactly did a team of PROFESSIONALS decide that IN A **COMMUNICATION** APP YOU DON'T NEED A LIST OF CONTACTS?? Soo. Very. Basic.

Also when I try to reinstall it gives me errors when I try logging back into my work profile most of the time. | No inicia sesión con ninguna cuenta, esta actualización es basura. | It used to be a great way of staying in touch with coworkers, but now it will not load any new messages until days after they are sent. I get the email that I have a new message in one of my groups, but I can NOT open it in the app, because it shows there is none. I've missed a lot of info that I need, and I can't even update the app because it's at the latest one. | this app stopped working for me. | Helpful | Nice experience | Bad interface, joining a meeting is not straightforward like ZOOM, not beginner friendly. | It suddenly stopped working. It was laggy but working fine until I logged out. Now it won't let me log in. It shows an error saying we can't log you in, please try again. I'm guessing some issue with the Microsoft Authenticator API. | Very nice App | Issue: I have seen the message already in laptop, even replied. Then, after a while I get notification of the old message which is already seen and to which I have already replied. | Péssimo aplicativo, não funciona. Depois da atualização eu não recebia nenhuma notificação, e agora ele não atualizava a págia das equipes.

To top it all off it doesn't work correctly on data or wifi so it seems kind of useless if you ask me."",""I don't like the changes that occurred here in teams. The mobile app does not fully support the opening of the file tab, hence, I cannot see any if the files for my class when I need it. Unlike the old version wherein it supports the opening of the tab. The same problem occurs in the windows application version 2. The file tab keeps on lagging. Not only the file tab but the whole application itself tends to lag.

Transparent text and impossible to use. This is the second update that has the same bug. | With largest product range, the app is well designed to let the user find the required product. | I spend wayyyy too much time using this app! Haha brilliant for planning out rooms, decorating ideas etc. IKEA is my go to for all home items and never ever lets me down as far as price and quality is concerned | Works okay from what I have done | Absolutely love the app and the store | Great tool | Good | Fairly good app, but since a few months they started using notifications to spam me with offers I'm not interested in and there seems to be no way to turn them off without deactivating all notifications of the app (including useful ones). Very annoying! | Please review the login process. It is impossible to authenticate with email or phone number, as it says that the account can't be found. But I have no issues with authentication on the website. | Doesn't work properly in dark mode! App has a problem with displaying labels in dark mode!!! | When you check out, the app gets you to type in address, and then route you to choose the automatic typed in address, but proceeds to tell you it exceeds 50 characters! Good luck letting people who live in apartments shop on the app!!! | It's lit | So good products | Incredible!! | don't miss out, two new notifications from IKEA!! | Good | Good | Works well | Want shower cuertain delivered | Love Ikea | Great idea if it works. I downloaded it as I am building and plan on using IKEA furniture in a couple of rooms so wanted to plan them out to figure out if it was suitable for the space, but everytime I try use kreativ it errors out before I can even start planning | 👍 | I paid money online to Raftaar Welding works by this application with faith of IKEA application. The 9 months passed but I didn't received Sofa cum bed order placed , I send lot of Reminders and mail but no response. Very bad . My payment transfer to Raftaar Welding works showing in my account. After receiving payment not getting the order item . | Ikea is the best and most affordable 😍 Easy to build | Good to see you | Vrlo informativna i korisna aplikacija. Dobra priprema pred kupovinu. | Absolutely pathetic & disappointing app , take ages to load , they are more interested in collecting our data | DIDNT EVEN LET ME USE IT | Nem működik | Waste app | Absolutely love the Ikea app! Quick delivery and tons of products to choose from for whatever you may need | Nice shopping app for quality products | Product quality is very good at reasonable price | Don't have ability to put or move items to in-store list now, only online. So to find location in store have to click into each item and isn't efficient. | Love love love ikea ,I'd sleep there if I could . A+++++ | Perfection.. | It's really good | HOLYIKEAINALLLAW HOLYIkeaINALLLAW HOLYikeaINALLLAW | Easy to use 👍 | Easy to browse IKEA's products, check availability, see your previous purchases or track an order. The only thing I dislike is that you can only search for products, no content results will come up. The website shows both products and content related to my search. You can browse inspiration on a particular room, but only random pictures, can't search for ""minimalist hallway"" for example. If I want inspiration on ""small living"" or ""shared bedroom"" I still go to the website. | This app has made my ability to find the amazing organizational items I need. This is dangerous for my pocketbook | Looooooove the app! Everything clearly displayed and explained with dimensions 😍 Love shopping on the app 🥰 also love making my shopping list on the app so I go to the shop to check it in person before buying 🥳 Thank you!! | Ikea kündigt 7h Lieferzeit Zeitfenster an, man nimmt sich extra frei und dann funktioniert weder die Lieferungsverfolgung noch wird in dem Zeitenster geliefert. man sitzt sich einen Tag lang, an dem man sich extra frei genommen hat, den Hintern platt, hat keine Ware und ist genervt. Als Kontakt oder Hilfe gibt es einen Chatbot auf der Seite, der nur sagt, man würde sich melden wenn nicht heute noch die Ware kommt. Da wäre es billiger gewesen einen Transporter zu mieten aber arbeiten zu gehen. | Good layout of interface. Easily navigatable | No 1 worestest app | Unable to login. I used my credentials that are correct, it said I need to login through browser, but the browser won't let me, so it told me to click the three dots and open in app. The app it directs me to is the old one which doesn't work.. I then created a new login in the app and right away after completing, it says same thing, cannot log me in. | Easy to create a shopping list and plan for a trip to ikea | Great app! I would love to be able to use the designer tools from my phone too. | Amazing | 😁❤👍 | Easy to use, practical, and helps to pay for your items while browsing in the store. | Ikea has stores all over the globe and surely this app exists in many languages, so why language options are so strict and do not allow users to chose English (for example) with every country store (if not any language)? I just don't understand... Searching a product in a language that is not your own is already a pain, but combined with this terrible search and category navigation makes me quit every time without buying online. Please consider to enable language selection. | Great app, but buggy when making payments. Usually I browse in the app and make payments on the webpage, but the browsing experience is great! | Obtaining refund is a torturing experience. Customer care team is ruthless. | I love Ikea and app | The app is best | Others : 😊😊 But me : scp 3008💀💀 Americans : scp 3008 ☠️☠️☠️☠️ don't know what I'm talking about go to YouTube and type ikea scp 3008 | It's ikea | I don't understand the stupid solution to lock one language for one region. So I have no ability to use an application with a language that I can understand. And the system language is English, so I'm sure that app supports it. And why, for Japan (for example) app supports manual language choice but for some EU countries no? Why you just can't unlock manual language choice for all regions? | Disappointing when there is no signal in IKEA and wifi is a speed of a dial up connection. You provide an app but takes several minutes to open using the guest wifi signal in store. 4G signal is of no existence in store!! | Love it | App is easy to search for products and is very intuitive. | Poor, it needs way more work before the app went live! Have you even pentest done?! The app looks dodgy because it doesn't work. | Great with English support in Sweden | Works well and has lots of useful features | Update: 03-11-2024 The issue appears to have been fixed hence, amended the rating. When attempting to Sign In with e-mail or mobile number, keep getting a notification stating I'm a bot ? Something went wrong., Unable to sign-in.. | Major issues with checkout when it does not work and you cannot leave the store. Uninstalled, installed again and again. :( Otherwise it's ok | ich kann nicht registieren. bitte fixieren den Bug sofort | this app collects all your personal data. instead of offering convenience for the shopper, it is aiming to make things convenient for the business instead. without offering personal details such as birthday information, it won't let you register. you need to scan your all of your items prior to coming to the checkout. scanning device doesn't work half of the time. after all the effort, and having account with your address details, the checkout machines still ask you to enter your postcode. | Good | Great app really smooth interface Love the ability to see what things look like in my room | I miss the planning tools that only seem to exist in the browser | Disappointed | It would be nice if I could pick English as the language despite living in Germany. | Very useful, especially convenient with the self-scan and pay, do not have to wait in line for so long at the check out, brilliant !! | Easy to find product and super fast for self scan and check out | So easy to shop using the app! I can create a list add items to it and then checkout for delivery or click and collect! Really easy and takes away the stress of navigating the whole store. | Very easy to use | Has some more convenient options that the web version. | IKEA items are very reasonable | Excellent and momentous shopping experience | Fabulous | Smart and flexible planning tool. Helps both to order online and to plan one's trip to the store. | Outstanding app | Love the app easy to find items. I like how i can check an item is in stock before i go to the store | Easy to use. I've had no issues with crashes. | I would like to share 3 experience here. 1. The app little confusing to shop any product. 2. Offline at Turbhe, they have amazing place to shop but the Citi bank Ikea credit card keep disturbing and promise you free and discount plz don't fall in the trap. They will not bother once docs and card applied 3 transport facility - I had booked on Sunday and the items delivered after 5 days for 15 kms delivery. They keep telling line up not happened and Viwandi go down mein chala gaya ( stupid one) | Remove | Super easy shopping from the app!! Everything right at your fingertips and no walking around forever in the wearhouse!!! WIN + WIN | No me deja loguearme. | What's wrong with having a standard option to put the room size in and the allow you to populate the items in the room and move them around. The ar feature doesn't work for small rooms in my opinion, it's just a gimmick. | easy to use | Login doesn't work | Good experience | Good | Little different from generic UI we see in shopping apps. So little hard to use. | I felt like a kid in a candy store | Great store! Great stuff | Awesome loved 😍 | Aplicația nu este destul de ușor de folosit pentru mine. Mi-a cauzat timp pierdut și mulți nervi. Nu îmi place interfața prea luminoasă a aplicației. Standardul în 2024 este o interfață întunecată. | Easy | Very helpful app to find items you want in stores. | ❤️ | Bezużyteczna przy słabym połączeniu internetowym. Nie wychodzi poza ekran startowy. Wszystkie inne aplikacje działają | Accurate, easy to find items, and a very simple interface. Not unlike IKEA itself. Good job. | Amazing app very useful | Online shopping need more advance. | Nelze se přihlásit, při zadání hesla jsem vyhodnocen jako bot a zaslání jednorázového kódu nefunguje. | 👍 | Easy to navigate, find and save items. | Vaatii VPN yhteyden poistamista jotta voi kirjautua. Huono ratkaisu | Changing region forces the app language to change. So don't move to a new county or the app is worthless ig. | Shopping is easy and fun | Odlicno radi, lak pregled i naručivanje | Used to be great, but I can no longer login since the latest update. Now fixed as of 27/2/24 | All I see is a picture of a bed and a bouncing dot. I don't know where to click or what to do 🤷‍♀️ | Einkaufen bei IKEA ist eine schreckliche Erfahrung! Es wurden falsche Teile geliefert, jetzt warte ich seit mehr als 2 Wochen auf die Lieferung der richtigen Teile, aber der Kundenservice war nutzlos, sie entschuldigen sich nur und verschieben das Problem auf nächste Woche. sie helfen nicht. Ich werde nie wieder etwas bei IKEA kaufen und rate jedem davon ab, etwas zu kaufen, wenn ihm seine Zeit und sein Seelenfrieden wichtig sind. | Love IKEA - just evaluate what you are purchasing and for what environment | easy to use and very convenient | Great information on products | The app doesn't load so it's useless. The issues started around the end of last year and have only been getting worse. | Wanted to favourite an item, clicked create new list, had to restart the app completely for the list to show up. And then it was empty, didn't even contain the item I wanted. | Never get a barcode after paying. I always have to open my email, find the receipt among 12 attachments, open it, zoom in on the barcode in the attachment and then I can get through the gates. Debatable if it is a time-saver or not. | Awesome | Great App! My favorite app/store for all my housing needs and wants. | Can't log in. It says something went wrong and tap the 3 dots to go to the app and there are no dots. Go back to the app to log in and the same thing happens. | Love ikea and the app makes shopping so much easier | 🖤🖤🖤 | Den enda delen jag var intresserad av, att planera ett rum, fungerar inte på enheten. Istället får man en länk som leder till webbsidan som säger att man ska använda appen. | Has everything you need in a doing app and works. Search for items, see stock levels, quick checkout, shopping list, online purchasing. | Easy to use, clear info on products, similar products, paying and delivering models | I installed this application because I want to renovate my room and I thought it would be the best option. And it really is! ❤️And the 3D option is so cool😃 | Great app, works fast, can use to scan items while shopping then pay quickly | Not working properly in android notepad | Tad bit laggy but overall love the app | The load times are so slow. I looked up what I wanted on the website, scrolled through all the options and returned to the app and it was still loading. | Cannot log in.... | Good price, friendly staff. | Love it | Excellent app with all the relevant product details. The page loading is a bit slow even with faster internet, the interface experience could be made smoother... | It works as intended. | Easy to use, scan in store and add to cart is awesome. Also, it's ikea. | Love it! | Very good furniture at good prices | Yo why did nobody tell me how to exit ikea yall I been wandering these yellow rooms for hours rn I'm boutta go cray cray ong I ain't never goin to ikea again 😭😭🙏🙏🙏 | Most of the products are unavailable. | Ikea always excellent | Great options. Lovely UI | Ok | Love filling my basket for when I'm in store. | Nice | Uoversiktlig..... | Beautiful products | Works just as intended. I don't have an IKEA in my state so this helps. 😊 | Good quality products and easy to fix | Just download it already, used this to decorate my apartment and there ar room scan feature made the experience even better than I could wish for. | Perfect for adding things to my list for when I visit the store | Scam. They take your pictures and scan your room, and THEN make you login/sign in with IKEA. Do not use. | Super | My Ikea app is not loading anymore. I don't know what's wrong with it. | Jabbar ole ole | Finally a place where I can save my favorite items and see every available option!! Get this app NOW!!! | Good app love the products | Simple, well designed and functional. Excellent 👍 | The app helps you make your final decisions before going into the store. Just a real help, just call before going in the store to make sure your item is in stores and not just on line. | Scanning and qr scan payment at terminal worked fine, but app thinks that I have NOT paid and refuses to show anything but a ""you must complete purchase"" screen. | Very, very, very bad customer support. Called 3times, and waited each time more that 30min. Absolute joke of a company. | Excellent app | Good, and easy and satisfied. Thanks. | ♥️ | The app works mostly fine, sometimes it is hard to find the right category of what you are looking for. The language can't be changed for the region you are browsing in. for example you can't have app language in Swedish in Finland. | I work for IKEA, so I'm hoping I get a pay rise for this comment. | Ikea is Ikea... The Best Store for Furniture | Good | Frequently Wonky Products | Worst after sales support IKEA has, the support team is highly untrained. Incase we have to return a product some Form need to be filled up and sent, why cant the support professionals do that on customer behalf. It's like IKEA has a policy ""make the process so complicated so that return is not possible for online delivery purchase"" | Easy to use at the store and at home! | Excellent | Please do open a store at vizag | It is helpful | Good app | Best | Too slow got irritated within 5 min | App was not installed on my smart phone. | Easy to navigate | Ikea Kreativ, room scan not working | Great place for shopping household items, a huge place where you can spend a whole day looking and having beautiful ideas. Great value and affordable for all budgets with a nice and helpful team. Products are good quality and last a for a long time. A nice food court area, must try, the food is amazing. You should try some meatballs and hotdogs on the way out. | There is/was/will? No way to use Englush language with your address is in Finland. | So, my biggest complaint about the app is I can't order anything with it. My billing address and my shipping address are different, which the app doesn't know how to deal with. Had to place my order from the website. | Good deals. But app is 🐌 | Smart furniture ! | Changing from 5 to 2 stars. Have been buying from the app since quite some time. In my recent order, one item is missing and one display sample was sent. Had to contact customer service repeatedly. No call back from their side. While they are replacing the display sample item, they will 'check' with the packing team about the missing item. Which clearly means they will not be sending me the missing item. Totally lost trust in their service. If you place online order, please take unboxing video. | Nice and easy | I really wish that the 41st Ave. Capitola CA. Mall will have an Ikea of their own. Since there's an empty space in the Capitola Mall area. I already know that Ikea mainly sells home furniture. Even though they never sell other products like welding supplies, kitchen appliances, video surveillance equipment, wearing apparel, woodworking machines, beauty supplies, jewelry accessories, etc. | Very good | Easy to operate. Can choose as per the requirements, colour sizes,price, warranty etc. Easy to visualise the decore. Able to know the range of fabrics and accessories available. | Having so much fun finding the shelf I want. Trying to get a jump on what I am going to buy when I go there next week. | Great ideas and products | Exellent!","{""1"":7813,""2"":4464,""3"":3348,""4"":10046,""5"":158058}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Inter IKEA Systems B.V","Inter+IKEA+Systems+B.V","ikeaandroidapp@ikea.com","https://www.ikea.com",,"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/customer-service/privacy-policy/","Inter+IKEA+Systems+B.V","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U_hRwbvZcVxq32BmCBGRd-dH9S2PmkiFovPdEz5CPDzMzELNYP7njs44EQFqTWQJIdc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZeUtX5IdkunPYdX17x-Ap_xsBwboF-3Lji3_rIKOmXOUB5KYk0KBWeXQ6lV5mJo1HQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/m7cUT-a1vBQzO2eRsj2Crn4cWn9GDhjwS7meyVcUv_CqrM8PACoi_aQs8LhYASqicg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jHchlBMtj2pXnqubZkPBQma1KeuvcnUzTkUigOYCGjNoU7cLLw4jfOt79476dDRa0Lt9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FSrKbw0xgr4WZaogiM9YO_gc3KQUzlhmMtG3Qv4ttHMBcY0BU2ufhVJ4v4KQsZxTOFEc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8dLI--VMTDFPuTnbZsL8fdvM5MQchjbF5Jyb8eeTp_T2Fa0UJ6dJEjPYq6bHnsfh6Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gbwFSKdODfSvh64ub0Mghcwk1-x4ywhngNoOAZx3xk6plZPNieCQ-VqWyddCxfONG0ai"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lwpAEcL9SELTOfBKZLRG9Ij2JATd1-aJWdI8ql-Qe-sMsIdUOt3nQL-8JNG2iamasIJD"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_ITk5OqbL_yQrhJSzBDLIBMsxbUuM0LR16DN8RN1B81TVsSTgHslPBabYV1-Hsw7cWNE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/onEIl7JgxljuE12ASwqre7NWkfWkdRQAI6qNhFSGEN54I_WlrYGfG1TJzUc332mNB_Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1YKHSUdguk1V58YqITpYjban8eGqkEtqGWYjMpyWOFLSrgjomTi3gAcxw9qu3k760HM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uoPyXii2IsRwK1QE3ToDrYRIVGbCnOJeboQBX6WJyntJ7lX7vB6Ruj8ObUAo6iL6gQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZPtx2YVew_Cfh37nWFL4ZuIDwOU3ZnFqRqTq39MJGJcWmI9rgw2JpecWW1q2umF-BmNX"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QpGIThqXfy3lEmFa5SyGh39OC_M4ifyUKiixSRWDghffTxB0TmJEceaiJVRR8PBScrI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vZPKkMOfDSA27MFCY3DbSsD_VVmZf3bytKFPIRjPH_RuMbk0AfBgNZ48_3HEKHX38Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hbWn8USFg2VvHUSusR7wqywGplC7CzyjApbweL1tPWYKrGjZ3Ma_4ZpnVXgFVV5u4w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GMNIdHxp-D3nfP0KNLHGVLH0Ea53eTg3OW0ZDXUwDLPQhi2qBPtCmBoKwiZKr4XaFlw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4iViXTD13O4hcus6l1fommRlzDNk7FGvF_ZmHANO9IJRvOrxJl47zpHrI8WmST6SKnY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4fWuB70ydjBEB7PATthJPxL2ZgiMJzIHqAbxjt76nP-V7Lkx8mgdKhfEEWLZZTsp3A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tboC1MFis-mPTsPrGSV0cahwKoDVXIXWbmiiH7nDLJOPtcdHz_jFZ8eTTl88eNL1Igk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/81Re1Wzhok6bpqg7DhsOTC3GJFBTcFl5F0SxWURUj8frbFEJjaFN9QwiUomioY3ynw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IZliB81fOO1wjHAVxte5mWCuPS8T9DwpjqB1FLYlT72zE6WrHYz8EAB-XmF0gdGWqYjr"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J5yZt5gC1hJ8R9XHwJoJLJb1769l3IfHzm2VJP2NiQBUXcT8j3P3Foppcqhnv8DStcI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KMPwc5Prtn7Vi_qYVz9HsVItEJokpNB1d0K9C5UMIvVeaiPtiO_pvNfxH5e1GwQQAA4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2TcTZ1dKS1PSaSrj46ARHZDZOZANW_h9Gjf4a-EMPgvgMqPtgKYG0mFDibxrkz-j95f2"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TrG1RVPz8rSLGGK6mR8oznfwb__YPsCNPeOWPXLTqWtjjtRozjQ3nLz-2IHO6TF_Ng""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jun 7, 2021",1710772000000,"3.62.0","Bug fixes and performance improvements.<br>","[""I love shopping using the app. There are two improvements I'd like to see. 1) Make it easier to browse by categories, it's somewhat difficult to find. 2) When browsing a category with lots of things, app loads a new batch of items and returns me to the beginning of the list, so I have to scroll back down where I was multiple times, which is annoying (Android)"",""Unable to login.

A reading appeared without knowing how it happened and it was very different from an actual BP cuff measurement. | Misleading ad made it seem you could take your blood pressure through the app. You can not! You take your BP on an actual monitor and put the numbers into the app to track how it fluctuates. Uninstalled immediately | I don't know yet I haven't | Thanks dear | Doesnt work - compared it with a regular bp meter and completely doesnt match | Just started using app. We'll see how it works out | This app is a joke. First thing is advertisment pop up before going in. And just got in before measuring, the result is already there before you add. No star at all.

So far, great to use! Simple! | Excellent | Fantastic | Aestatic!!!! | Don't work | Good | Nothing but adds | Still learning. 15 min later, having trouble reading this app. My problem is I cannot get reading of my BP..... | With further developments. | This is first tiime | I am not in favor of additional offers | Awesome | Total rubbish, just adds. | me use | Ok | Good | Not too bad | Just downloaded this application, seems really good at first sight. | How does it work cz I see so many? | Self installed from an ad.

Tvrdi ze informace jsou vyzadovane zakonem, avsak aplikace vyzaduje informace mnohem detailnejsi nez vyzaduje zakon. Pizaduji to vydirani ze strany banky za ucelem zjisteni detailnich informaci o pitencialni bonite klienta pro pripadnou nabidku uveru. Naprosto neakceptovatelne. | Bankovni aplikace ktera sdili soukroma data se tretimi stranami? No tedy klobouk dolu, koho tohle napadlo? A pokud s tim nesouhlasim tak 5kc za SMS? To je skoro vydirani. | If you click on some of the displayed offers, only to find some details, you will start getting notification spam. There is no way to turn it off in the app. | V aplikaci se nedá zobrazit PIN ke kartě - nevím, odkud máte ty screenshoty, no aplikace pro Android tak nevypadá, vygenerování jednorázového čísla karty pro nákupy na podivných stránkách, které by mohly zneužít číslo karty Moneta nepozná, nově také zmizely ikony v přehledu transakcí, takže když chci výdavky řadiť dle kategorií, tak vůbec nevidím, která již je zařazena a která ne. A o možnosti uložit si nějaké časté příjemce nemluvě.... | Proč zase komplikovat věci? Aby UI/design experti měli co žrát? | Cant use app when AnyDesk is installed | Mám trochu ""problem"" s jazykem v aplikaci. Co jsem pochopil, tak aplikace přebírá v základním nastavení jazyk telefonu (já mám telefon v anglictine). Aplikaci bych chtěl mít v češtině, což tedy lze v nastavení nastavit. Každopádně po nastavení češtiny v aplikaci je poté aplikace napůl česky a napůl anglicky. Např spodní ""menu"" mám celé anglicky, a jiné věci zase v češtině. | Většinou jsem schovívavý a nehodnotím negativně, nicméně v případě Monety ji shledávám jako neprofesionální banku. Například neustále mi chodí otravné emaily že to či ono je teď skvělé/nové ""Bezkontaktní placení je pohodlné"". Marketingové emaily jsem si vypnul, vyjádření reklamací je že to není marketing a nelze tyto emaily vypnout. Nic podobného jsem nezažil u jiných bank (mBank, ČSOB). | V ČR best. Oproti světovým lídrům z Fintech sektoru stále zaostává. Prosím zkopírujte funkce z Revolutu a poté dále stavějte na tom co se Vám zamlouvá. Uvítal bych zaokrouhlování plateb a zbytek spořit do trezoru, tak jak to má Revolut dále je výborné sdílení plateb, jako má Revolut atd.. Design máte také moc český... Celkem pozadu oproti světovému standartu. Chtělo by to posunout dopředu.. | Tomu nemůžu uvěřit. Mobilní aplikace nejde spustit z důvodu nainstalovaného AnyDesku (který nutně potřebuji) v mobilu. To si myslíte, že nevím co dělám? Za pochopení mi neděkujte, nechápu. | Prepnuti z AJ do CZ ma nulovy efekt. Nelze zobrazit cislo karty. | Chybí mi u spořící účtu co se obálek týče možnost nastavit trvalý příkaz např z hlavního či spořící účtu do dané obálky trvalý příkaz a ne do volných prostředků. U AirBank je možnost zvolit u spoření do obálek v trvalém příkazu. Mohu vybrat zda chci klasicky na spořící účet do volných prostředků nebo do dané obálky. Tohle by chtělo doplnit !! | Velmi zle. A nepaci sa mi, ze si Moneta vynucuje pouzivanie appky poplatkom za prihlasenie sa do internetbankingu na webe. | It's a great convenience but the payments seem to take a bit more time than expected. | Aplikace trvá na odinstalování jiné legitimní aplikace. Už jen to prohlíží ostatní nainstalované aplikace je nepřijatelné lezení do soukromí. | Smooth navigation, user friendly. So far looks my 2nd best banking app, since I don't yet use Moneta as my first banking account. | Apka bývala skvělá, ale po updatu 2-3 roky zpět se výrazně zhoršila, poslední dobou je už skoro nepoužitelná. Neustále errory, zamrzání, každé přihlášení, je bolestivý zážitek. | very good | Velka spokojenost | Čím dál horší prace s kategoriemi. Vše se cpe do jídla, třeba i Sportisimo. Po změně kategorie se v přehledu nezmění. Nastavování kategorií v prehistorickém internetovém bankovnictví. Neumí to v apce ani novém internetbankingu. Nemožnost si jednou nastavenou kategorii nastavit pro příští automat. Stále dokola ručně. Na upozornění daného stavu ani neodepíší. Hrůza | Hezký, přehledný a zatím vše funguje jak má. Edit: Nelíbí se mi, že nemůžu používat anydesk ani teamviewer. Používám tyto nástroje celkem často. | Crashing all the time, loading takes way too long. After the latest update, the app automatically adds two zeros (BEFORE the decimal point) to the amount sent, rendering it completely unusable. Considering switching banks just because of how bad this app is. | Unstable. I can't get how this app can be rated as one of the best?! I'm getting connection timeouts many times in day. Support is awful, don't care about complaints. | I am not able to log into the app. Restarting the mobile device does not help as well. The first registration email is also years ago and cant find it. | Po poslední aktualizaci se mi nezobrazují všechny výdaje a příjmy. Nejdou posílat peníze ze spořícího účtu přímo z dané obálky. Dříve to šlo. Pokud budou problémy opraveny, změním hodnocení. Edit: opraveno, dávám 5 hvězd | Protože se do aplikace nedostanete pokud používáte AnyDesk nebo jiné potřebné apky pro práci, tak Monetu nedoporučuju a ruším účty. Jdu ke konkurenci která upozorní že mám AnyDesk nainstalovaný ale pustí mě do mobilního bankovnictvína moji zodpovědnost!!! | Works OK enough, but quite buggy. Timeouts, app restarting itself etc. Language setting translates only about 50 % of text, the rest is still in device language. | Vyžaduje k aktivaci zadat QR kód, ale nenabízí možnost ho zadat. Hlava XXII. | Smart banka je důvod, proč zruším účet u Monety. Nikdo mi nebude přikazovat, jak mám pracovat se svým bankovním účtem. Přecházím do české Trinity banky | Reklamy při potvrzování platby, to jako fakt? | Pixel 6, Android 14 aplikace se nenačítá | Poslední aktualizace přinesla jen zklamání. Ošklivé, nepřehledné, pomalé... Základní informace o vlastním účtu se zobrazí až po pěkných pár vteřinách načítání a to jen po rozkliknutí, namísto zobrazení hned na úvodní straně, jak tomu bylo dříve... Seriózně přemýšlím o změně banky. Jak je vůbec možné, že se odsouhlasí změna, která z nejlepší bankovní aplikace (uživatelsky) vytvoří naprostý, s prominutím, odpad. Mrzí mě to. Myslel jsem, že má Moneta na víc. Edit po roce: vůbec nic se nezlepšilo. | You are not able to use app, while Anydesk and similar app is installed on mobile. Not able just confirm awarness of risk, you are not able to continue into app. Feedback on callcenter was to uninstalled, but I need those remote apps for work, so banking is useless. Other banks allow you to accept the warning and continue. Moneta considers its customers as legally incapable persons with no choise. | Extremely slow starting and a lot's of adds on services I'm not interested in. Plus i just found out several of my payment templates get deleted and it fails when i try to create new ones. | To ted musim odinstalovat Anydesk abych se dostal do aplikace?! Promiň te, ale limitovat klienty kteří potrebují Anydesk nebo Teamviewer k praci, že se nedostanou na banku? Nebylo by lepsi klienty v tomto vychovavat nez omezovat ty co si umi davat pozor? Jinak pro mne aplikace nema proste vyznam, kdyz ji nemohu pouzit a pracovni aplikace jsou prednejsi. Myslel jsem si, že zrovna Moneta je pokrokova banka... | Bugy, spatna odezva, nelogicke ovladani. Edit: Po roce pouzivani prechazim k jine bance,tahle aplikace se opravdu neda... | Nelze spustit, pokud je na telefonu nainstalovaný Anydesk. Asi nejsem jediný, kdo jej k práci potřebuje. | Opět si ze mne děláte srandu, vaše aplikace zřejmě trpí paranoiou a nutí mě odinstalovat aplikace které potřebuji k práci Jedná se o Teamviewer a Anydesk. Vidím tlačíto i přesto spustit banku, ale nejde to stisknout. S vašima vývojáři nesouhlasím, aplikace jsou bezpečné. Problém je jen v uživatelích. Tohle se dá řešit úplně jinak, např. nepovolit přihlášení když je aplikace spuštěná, při spuštění té dané aplikace se odhlásit z banky. Nebo jen donutit uživatele změnit nastavení pro aplikaci. | Potřebuji mít nainstalovaný Anydesk i TeamViewer. Kvůli své práci. Aplikace nejde spustit dokud tyto aplikace neodinstaluju což nemůžu. Odpověď: děkujeme za recenzi je stupidní odpověd. Správná odpověď zní: omlouváme se, opravíme to. | Shows ads for irrelevant products. Repeatedly. When you try to rate the app lower than what they want they ask you to email and they hide the prompt instead. :) :) | Not only my smart bank app data are still corrupted, but it's blocking me from logging in, as i am using anydesk as personal app for connecting to pc from mobile. | V zahraničí téměř nepoužitelná!!! V EU funguje zpomaleně, v USA, Africe či Novém Zélandě téměř vůbec!!! Mohli byste s těmi servery něco udělat. Pokud nelze poslat ze zahraničí příkaz k úhradě, tak apl. k ničemu!!! | Suddenly decided that it won't let me into the application if I have AnyDesk installed. Meaning I am locked out of my bank because of an application I need for work. | iOS app is much better. Widgets do not work at all and overall it feels quite clunky compared to iOS app. | simple and reliable | I have set up the way I want my accounts lined up, and they're still constantly switching places. What in the world is that? Why even have the option to line them up when they don't stay in one place? This app just keeps getting worse, and I thought that wasn't possible after that legendary switch from great to horrible. | Aplikace mi začala padat. Nedokážu potvrzovat platby. Povede se cca 1 pokus z 30. Komunikace s podporou na jedničku. Domluveno, že mě bude kontaktovat někdo přímo z vývoje. Už je to X dní a nikdo se neozval. | After latest update app stop working and constantly crashing. I can't send payment, many times even confirm payment, or look at account history. Please work on that! I can't use Internet Banka if cannot confirm payments. | Aplikace již několik týdnů nefunguje, v 99% se nejde přihlásit, obrazovka zůstane na té první stránce s logem a vůbec se nezobrazí možnost přihlášení. Poslední verzi mám. Asi to brzo bude důvod změnit banku, když se nelze spolehnout :( a to bývala MMB moje nejoblíbenější | Plno reklam a záložek na nabídky produktů, které nejdou skrýt. | Netýká se to mobilní aplikace, ale je to jedno z mála míst, která někdo čte a reaguje na ně. Sundavám všechny hvězdičky za to, že posíláte reklamní SMS, která nelze zrušit. (A kdovíjak dlouhý rozhovor po telefonu nepovažuji za relevantní způsob, jak zrušit zasílání obchodních sdělení.) | It works really well, interface is intuitive. I like a lot that you can bring in live information about accounts in other Banks via a token, and have one central hub for monitoring and accessing your overall banking. This feature does not affect applications that you might have for other institutions. | Poslední měsíc se mi nedaří přihlásit do aplikace. Někdy to funguje, většinou ne. Vznikají trapné situace, kdy potřebuji někomu zaplatit a nemám přístup k účtu. Aplikace podporuje přepínání profilů (osobní vs firemní), ale nefunguje nastavení defaultního profilu. Kvůli tomu selhává potvrzení plateb a je potřeba znovu opakovat dokud neprojde. Psal jsem na support, kde mě odpálkovali s tím, že si mám updatovat aplikaci (samozřejmě mám poslední verzi). Kdysi to bývala nejlepší aplikace na trhu. | Dobrá a funkční aplikace, ale už MOC komplikovaná. Připadám si jako důchodce, když nemůžu najít úplně základní věci. Mělo by se zase trochu ubrat a přepracovat UI, aby bylo více intuitivní. Tohle už je trochu moc :D | All perfect! | OK. Add says: ""you will have product in a few minutes!"" No way! App gives ""unexpected error"" no matter what way you use to confirm identity (Bank ID, or scan documents). So after 45min of useless attempts you call support and it sounds like they are having a party in the background. Cool. So 1 hr passed and I am going to another bank, thanks. | OK | Pro nováčky neintuitivní, mám 2 další účty i aplikace a přesto jsem zde měla problém vytvořit nový trvalý příkaz, chtělo to trochu zkoumání. Nezvládá landscape mode, na tabletu komplikace. | works well | Bohužel nefunguje. Včera jsem chtěl poprvé využít funkci Smart banky při platbě kartou na internetu. 2x otisk prstu, nic, 2x PIN, nic. Nakonec jsem si musel nechat poslat beztak SMS. K čemu potom za aplikace je? | Tristni uroven zabezpeceni a nucene zhorseni. Doposud byla moznost 2FA overeni(sms+dlouhe heslo), nyni uz je jedinou ochranou 4 mistny PIN. | Dva mĕsíce nefunguje směnárna - ani na mobilu, ani na PC: ""Neočekávaná chyba - zkuste to později."" Řešení v nedohlednu. Po překonání 1st level supportu žadná další odezva. Dělám jim testera. Vývoj na to z vysoka... Asi třeba nejprve naplánovat do sprintu. --- Odpověď Monety jen podtrhuje onu tragikomičnost. Se ""zákaznickým servisem"" si dopisuji již měsíc. A výsledek? Mám napsat na zákaznický servis. | Good bank | Nelíbí se mi že se aplikace jmenuje Smart Banka, místo například Moneta Banking, nebo tak něco. Také mi chybí možnost přepnout jazyk (telefon mám anglicky, ale právnicinu bych raději česky). Naopak kladně hodnotím funkčnost (momentálně více funkcí než internet banking např v nastavování limitu nebo přechod od jiné banky). Vítám také možnost přidat a odebrat další telefon/zařízení. | Uses 3rd party to monitor everything on the phone. 3rd party !!! EDIT: I write in English they reply in Czech. Changing my review to from 2 to 1 star. The above stands still: it is a spyware ! Collects everything possible from the phone!EDIT2: So now they switched to English. Interesting why they didn't reply in English initially. Anyways, I have the mobile apps of 3 other banks. They don't collect that much data. And mainly: they don't provide it to a 3rd party companies!!!!! | Funkcionalita je dobrá i když mi aplikace nepřipadá úplně přehledná, ale to je spíš o zvyku. Nízké hodnocení dávám, protože mě hodně naštvalo, že aplikace odmítá fungovat (nejde se přihlásit do aplikace, ani přes aplikaci potvrdit přihlášení na PC), při nízkém stavu baterie (na mém telefonu se na 17 a míň % nezapne, s tím, že telefon samotný zvládne ještě půl dne fungovat). | TLDR: Nová verze aplikace je nedodělaná; Shrnutí: vizuální glitche, aplikace se občas sama vypne (spadne), navigace aplikací není intuitivní (3 různá tlačítka pro nastavení aplikace, atd), vizuálně mi přijde nová verze méně přehledná (je z toho teď omalovánka); Zatím jsem nenašel věc, v čem by byla nová verze lepší, než ta stará, za to je tam řada věcí, které jsou oproti předchozí aplikaci značně horší. | Po update mi pise ze Smart Bance chybi internet a nejde se vubec prihlasit. | Aplikace fungovala v poradku do okamziku, kdy se mi vzdy pri otevreni objevi 'something went wrong, please try again later'. Support team byla jen ztrata casu a nakonec nebyli schopni muj problem vyresit. Nechapu, proc v tento okamzik nuti sve uzivatele na potvrzeni skrze smartbanku a ne sms, kdyz je smartbanka nepouzitelna. Jsem u teto banky jiz 14 let, ale nyni prejdu k jine bance, ktere normalne funguje aplikace. | Ze všech bank nejlepší podmínky pro BÚ. Mobilní aplikace ale bohužel přesný opak. | Nelze zkopírovat číslo účtu v detailu platby. 🤦‍♂️ | Great app, lot of useful features | Poslední aktualizace se nějak nepovedla a před pokusem o přihlášení zobrazuje informaci, že schází připojení k internetu. Ověřeno, a minimálně telefon je k internetu připojen. | Simple to use app, makes ones life easier! | Spyware. Collects data about phone and installed apps. | Notifikace k autorizaci platby kartou se objevují jen občas, většinou musím otevřít aplikaci manuálně a přihlásit se, abych platbu potvrdil. Notifikace o zaplacení kartou ale fungují vždy. | Update - 3 různí lidé na MOJI urgenci slibují, že se do týdne ozvou, po měsíci se samozřejmě nikdo neozve. Nemůžu platit kartou přes internet, nemůžu platit QR platby. Spousta ztraceného času. Dají se dát záporné hvězdičky? Poslední review ze 7.11.: Už více jak týden SB NEFUNGUJE - nelze se přihlásit, appka crashuje. Přeinstaloval jsem, znovu nastavoval zařízení pro SB a opět opakovaně crash. Už před měsícem jsem musel appku reinstalovat, aby fungovala, teď už raději nefunguje vůbec... | gold-black design was faaaar beter + too often technical service in progress ... | Awful, keeps crashing. If something ain't broke, don't fix it | Posila notifikace s nevyzadanou reklamou. Vyjadreni zakaznicke podpory: ""Aplikace je marketingovou plochou spolecnosti, reklamy nejdou nijak zrusit."" | Aplikace nefunguje v zahranici, kdyz si dam VPN do CR,tak normalne bezi. Proc? | Reklama na dětské konto (které je pro mě nerelevantní) je na prominentním místě v aplikaci, zabírá prostor mnohem důležitějším informacím (kvůli kterým aplikaci mám) a nejde vypnout!!!!!!! | The app is laggy sometimes | Jedním slovem katastrofa. Když se po dlouhém čekání na android konečně objevila možnost rušení spořících účtů, tak jakákoliv snaha o využití této funkce končí chybou : Nepodařilo se načíst data. A to už od té doby proběhly 2 hotfixy. | *už opraveno díky* Po updatu neumožňuje převést peníze mezi vlastními účty dlouhým stisknutím a pretazenim na jiný Můžete funkcionalitu prosím vrátit Děkuji | Super application 👌 | Prvotní neduhy nového interface zmizely. Opět je to plně použitelná bankovní aplikace. Nicméně záložka Insurance stále nefunguje a bylo by fajn lépe zapracovat stavební spoření do aplikace, pohyby na účtu, jednoduchý převod peněz. | After recent update just mentions ""something went wrong"" and that's it. I would like to politely remind to developers, that people use this program to manage their finances and it is probably the biggest part of bank client experience with the bank. The fact it just stops working without any hint how to fix it is plain negligence. Before when it ""worked"" it wasn't the best either, especially qr code scanning was of poor quality. What mBank app would scan fine, this one failed. | Jsou to zmetci. Plošně zablokovali transakce na burzu. Myslí si, že můžou rozhodovat za co budu utrácet svoje peníze. Končím, čus | Po aktualizaci nefunguje, stale pise ""smart bance chybi internet"" :-/ po reinstalaci to uz funguje. Celkove nevidim v nove aplikaci zadnou cestu v pred, z hlediska UX je to takova beta verze. | Dříve to byla jedna z uživatelsky nejpříjemnějších aplikací, co se bankovnictví týče. A právě díky tomu byla MONETA mým hlavním účtem. S posledními aktualizacemi se však naprosto vše zkomplikovalo (z transferu jedním posunutím se stala akce minimálně pětkrát delší a asi desetkrát komplikovanější), o přehlednosti ani nemluvě... Třešničkou na dortu je, když v akcích na svém účtu místo jména majitele účtu vidíte pouze zprávu příjemce... Mým primárním účtem se tak stal zase ten od konkurence. | Přestal fungovat widget, ale podle vyjádření Monety, to se řeší.... Už skoro měsíc... | 2022-10-14: • Nefunguje korektně s myší: kolečkem ani tažením nelze posunout obsah (v Home, Cards, Settings) → v režimu DeX na monitoru jsou některé funkce mimo dosah. Přitom v More kolečkem myši i tažením posouvat LZE. • Část apky je anglicky, část česky. Nesmyslně opravuje částku při platbě: 1000,10 → 1,000,1 → 1. • Při zadávání částky platby skryje disponibilní zůstatek. • 2022-09: Nikde nevidím tlačítko Aktivovat (kartu), o kterém se psalo v dopise s novou kartou (mělo být v detailu karty). | Vůbec nefunguje. Jen hlásí chyby. Podpora nedělá nic. Otřesný zážitek. BTW, jsem vývojář a nechápu, jak si to mohou dovolit | Good 👍 | This is is the worse update from Moneta, I have tried a million time just to upload my id still not succuss. I am very disappointed in this new app for that matter I have downgrade from 5 stars to 1 if there was zero, I would have rated the app 0. In this case I will rather login from website instead using this application. | Aplikaci po aktualizaci nelze používat bez schválení sběru dat o aplikacích na mém telefonu a sledováním z jakých internetových přípojek telefon používám. Hláška se odkazuje na ""prověřený software třetí strany"" který tyto data data zabírá a ukládá, není ale jasné o jaký software se jedná a kde jsou tyto data ukládány. Každopádně jsem aplikaci odistaloval a měním banku. | Právě jsem při spuštění aplikace dostal výzvu v angličtině, abych aplikaci povolil permanentní špehování. To snad nemyslíte vážně! Pokud bych si měl představit kybernetický útok na mobilní aplikaci, vypadal by právě takhle. Jak mám z té výzvy poznat, že pochází z banky a není podstrčená? | Na to, ze Moneta rika, ze za par mesicu nebude mozno se prihlasit pres webove rozhrani, je aplikace nefunkcni. Pri rucnim zadavani qr kodu, copy, paste, napsalo something went wrong. Uzasny error. Pri opetovnem unknown error. Skutecne odladena aplikace. A proc aplikace mluvi jen anglicky, kdyz je pro pouziti v CR? | Už několik týdnů nefungují Widgety na ploše. Člověk pro kontrolu zůstatku musí otvírat celou Smart banku. | To slabší na trhu bankovních aplikací. V přehledu účtů formát čísla 9,999.99 Kč v detailu účtu 9 999,99 Kč. Aplikace několikrát do měsíce padne (subjektivní, ale jiné aplikace nepadají). 1. místo ""Zlatá koruna"" je jen marketing - realita 3,7 z 5 hvězd v Google Play. Ale kdo nemá srovnání s konkurencí, může být spokojený. | Great bank app | Super. Bohužel mi na Samsung Galaxy S21 nefunguje widget. Stále se načítá a nikdy se nenačte, i když je povolen v nastavení . | Really good app | Vše přehledné, rychlé, stabilní a funguje jak má. | This app did not even start to work, said that something went wrong. I was considering to set up an account but like this I won't. | Jde se nějak vrátit k předchozí versi? Update je, promiňte, ale to nejde jinak říct, debilní, strakatý jak pro děti, velká tlačítka jak pro seniory a v QR platbě nefunguje čtení kódu ze souboru. | OK-ish, but has major flaws. For example, ""Savings"" (sporici) and ""Fixed term"" (terminovy vklad) accounts share the same template, thus showing exactly the same info. Which is wrong. They deserve to be tailored. Fixed Term needs to explicitly display Start of term; End of Term; Interest Rate (the row for this is empty); ideally the expected sum to be paid at the end of the term, this should be easy to calculate; button to withdraw early and the corresponding penalties. | Whatever I try to do, I get 'unexpected error'. How am I supposed to work with my money after 01/12 when Moneta will use this app ONLY? Fix it, it's worthless when you can't do anything because of 'unexpected error'! | Horrible new version, adding money to Revolut is a pain and lot of time app says something went wrong maybe too much maintenance I m in different time zone and this message apper at least once a week. | Tu novou appku dělala nějaká chráněná dílna? Stará aplikace mě téměř donutila přejít k vám od konkurence, nová mi připomněla, že sem ten přechod nedokončil a měl bych si zbývající prostředky přesunout zpět a účet zrušit. | Couldn't activate the card. I can not see the PIN. A few improvements necessary. RESPONSE: I am not able to see those options in Internet Banking or mobile app. | Po update změna UI, velmi nepřehledné, za mne velmi špatný krok | Great banking app | Nejhorsi update, ktery se teto aplilaci dostal. Tvrdite, ze funkce prevodu penez pretahnutim z jednoho na druhy ucet jak tomu bylo u drivejsi verze by mela byt opet aktovni. Ale nefunguje. | Celkem ok a dobre funkce, jen po nascanovani QR kodu se stane chyba a od te doby se vsechny castky u zadanych plateb nasobi 100x... docela neprijemny problem (asi chyba v desetinnem oddelovaci v ceskem rozhrani a anglickem mobilu. Nez potkam QR kod, tak to funguje, po nem se to rozbije a je nutny restart aplikace) | Převod jedním tahem po novém updatu nefunguje, aplikace je teď celkově méně přehledná, není tak intuitivní jako předtím a ještě ke všemu hůře vypadá.. předchozí verze byla mnohem lepší. | Often stops working on Android. | New version is terrible | This app lacks many financiall planning features. E.g. working with tags for transactions and further analysis is cumbersome. I would appreciate more simple utils similar to maybe.co financial planner. There are also some bugs from time to time, but I understand this app is insanely complex and hard to test for your QA team. | The new version is terrible... You can't activate new card in the new version, you need to go to web... And did anyone try to set card limits in the new version, where the popup keyboard covers the fields? Whoever butchered the once good app to this mess should be fired | Cannot scan ID in app. Missing personal information. Buggy version of app. | And the ""most difficult and least customer friendly app of the year"" is... Seriously, is this a banking app or just the way to piss customers off...? Nothing works, you have to try 5 times, only to get the message that ""we have you data but want you to take pictures of your ID again"". Would be fun if they were not handling your money... | Ta nová aktualizace je katastrofa, stará verze byla o 100% přehlednější. | Však to crashuje když jdu do detailu účtu. Týden zpět jsem se nemohl ani přihlásit. Co jste stim udělali? Proč mě trapite? | Dá se vrátit zpět aktualizace? Poslední verze aplikace je slušně řečeno nepoužitelná... | Dal bych 5 hvezd pred tim nez jste zmenily vzhled a funkcnost vasi aplikace. Byla uasna, dejte aspon moznost tu starou verzi pouzivat, protoze tohle je neprehlednej bordel. Nebo to proste vratte zpet. | Docela dobré, obvykle tuhle aplikaci mam rad. V poslední dobe ale obcas pro pokusech o platbu pres QR kod scan spadne a nic nejde udelat. Dela to na stejnem QR kodu i bezna verze app na jinem telefonu a jinem uctu. Samotny QR kod přitom v RFBank app prošel. | Update May 2022: proč jste tak přehlednou a rychlou aplikaci zkazili novým designem? Nejen, že je extra nepřehledný, ale aplikace je o dost pomalejší a na většinu úkonů je třeba více kliknutí. Tohle je za mě krok velmi špatným směrem. K reakci MMB: místo zbytečných reakcí si prosím přečtěte pořádně jak mou recenzi, tak ostatních po květnové aktualizaci. Námětů na opravy (úpravy) v nich najdete dost. | Appka nefunguje, pada. Nedokazem ohodnotit vyzor a pod. Dokazem ale podotknut, ze zo vsetkych bankovych appiek bola ta od monety najlepsie navrhnuta. Ak sa to zmenilo ako sa ludia stazuju, tak sa netesim, ked to zacne fungovat. | Když naskenuji QR kód z vašeho webu, tak na mě furt vyskakuje Invalid QR code | Since the major update, completely wrong presentation of credit cards (no details on the front page). After today's update still not fixed | It is a good app, unfortunately in the new version, when I try to change limits on my card the keyboard wont go away, resulting in me, not being able to save changes, so in the end, I cannot change it, which is a huge mistake and should be immediately fixed | Proč nejde měnit limit na kartě v noci? To to schválně pozastavujete? | Nová verze výrazně neprehlednejsi. Opravdu už nemůžu zadat převod tahem prstu z jednoho vlastního účtu na druhý? A proč nevidím v přehledu účtů číslo účtu? Nutite mě každou chvíli nesmyslně zakládat nový spořící účet a tyto věci mi pomáhaly se v tom vyznat. Zrušení starých účtu asi přes aplikaci taky nejde :( | I used to be very happy with this app. But after last update I am not able to orient in it. As somebody mentioned before, IT looks like a high school project, rather than professional app. IT Evžen does not support dark mode anymore, do everytime I use this app, my eyes just hurts when I have to switch to light mode to be able to read text. | Bývala to skvělá aplikace, po poslední aktualizaci se ale stala velmi uživatelsky nepřívětivou a také nevzhlednou. | Kterej galaxy brain zavelel k tomu grafickýmu overhaulu, kterej je naprosto ohyzdnej? Proč nyní v seznamu historických příkazů nevidím jména druhých účtů? Musim kliknout na každou platbu zvlášť, abych zjistil, kdo to poslal. Proč vylepšujete aplikaci tím, že ji zhoršujete? | Hrůza po poslední aktualizaci, nepřehledné. Jen víc složitější převod emzi svým účty.. | Po poslední aktualizaci spuštění smart banky to vypadá, jako by se jiná aplikace vloudila do přihlašovací obrazovky a pokoušela ukrást PIN. Asi je to záměr, ale pro jistotu jsem se radši přihlásil na jiném telefonu, kde aktualizace ještě není. | Z naprosto jednoduche a uzivatelsky prijemne aplikace jste udelali neprehlednej paskvil. Je mozne se vratit k puvodni verzi? | Although i like the looks actually the usability got slightly worse with latest update in may 2022. I used to transfer between my accounts by dragging from one acc to another. Now have to click on one, copy acc number, go back, click on next and paste the number ... 5 steps instead of 1. Not sure why they removed the ability | Aplikace vypadá velice krásně a moderně, ale prosím Vás, spravte ty bugy. Tam, kde by měl záznam měsíčních výdajů končit, se celý seznam začne opakovat a je nekonečný. Souhrn měsíčních výdajů taky nevychází a ani se nezobrazují všechny transakce. | Nový vzhled aplikace je neodpustitelný zločin. Z nejlepší bankovní aplikace jste udělali nepřehledný a odpudivý... cosi... Veliké zklamání. | What the hell have you done to your app????!!!?????!!!! This was one of the most professional looking, perfectly functional apps I have ever used. After the latest update it looks like something put together by a student for a school project. This is horrible. Several options are hidden or difficult to find, the design is cancerous, it is unsightly. Please make it look the way it was. This is sad... | Předešlá verze za mě byla na 6 hvězd. Výborná, přehledná, všechno rychle po ruce. Nový vizuál je děsný. Dávám jednu hvězdu. Nepřehledný, obří font, nejde tahem převádět peníze mezi svými účty atd. | good. edit: annoying offers and for me useless messages from bank. can't stop it in the app. why? edit for delevopers - jsou to reklamní nabídky monety na půjčku atd.. zobrazuje se to na hlavni strance po přihlášení. nenašel jsem/nelze to vypnout/zakázat. btw, po dalším update celkem grafickej odpad. sry, ale před tím lepší vizuál. | Jděte do háje s tou změnou designu, nebo aspoň ponechte přepínač na tu starou. Aplikace je teď naprosto nepřehledná a hnusná, tenhle Apple-like design mi pije krev. REAKCE: Nepřehledná je správa běžného účtu. Aplikace je najednou plná nevypnutelných reklam a nabídek, původní ovládací prvky jsou z většiny skryté. Předchozí aplikace byla ceněna pro svou přehlednost, teď všechnu ztratila. Přeorat takto ze dne na den bankovní aplikaci bez jakéhokoli upozornění je velice neseriózní krok. | New version is faster and nicer | Hrozný, změna k horšímu. Oproti předchozímu, elegantnímu stylu aplikace, tahle nová verze vypadá jako mobilní téma pro seniory. Obrovská písmena, ošklivé bubliny a ještě ke všemu reklamy na produkty, které ani nejde nijak schovat. Příšerný. Není někde možnost vrátit aplikaci do původního zobrazení?","{""1"":1187,""2"":233,""3"":1106,""4"":16155,""5"":88191}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","MONETA Money Bank","MONETA+Money+Bank","smartbanka@moneta.cz","http://www.moneta.cz/smartbanka","Vyskočilova 1442/1b

Už 2x sa mi stalo, že som objednávku zadal, zaplatil, ale systém bol preťažený a na pobočke objednávku nedostali, prípadne trvalo niekoľko minút než sa im zobrazila. Obsluha je v takom prípade absolútne bezradná a typicky sa snaží človeka odbiť bez akéhokoľvek riešenia, čo je naozaj mizerný prístup k zákazníkovi. | Bugly, unpredictable, just loose my payed order No any contact point for support or refund provided. | Věčně něco nefunguje, takže kupóny nejdou využít. Buď se nenačte rovnou kupón nebo nejde zaplatit a nikdo neví proč... | App is ok, but it often has an error 503 during lunch hours. | Aplikace nefunguje. Všude pouze loading... | Pobocka sirejovice se ukazuje nekde u steti, na pobocce v sirejovich mi rekli ze mi asi blbe funguje gps. Jasne, to dava smysl. Blbe mi funguje gps, proto to moji polohu ukazuje spravne a statickou polohu pobocky 40km odeme. | Nejde zaplatit; po výběru a vyplnění všech povinných údajů tlačítko ""K platbě"" nic nedělá, jen se u něj protočí ""loading"" kolečko. | Aplikaci jsem si nainstaloval jen ""pod hrozbou"", že se zruší staré plastové karty. Registrace se povedla, ale dnes 29.2.2024 aplikace vůbec nic nenačte. Takže až (jestli) přijdu do BB, nebudu schopen ani ukázat kód. | Application simply doesn't work. Can't see the menu, coupons anything. It is just loading for minutes | V aplikaci nelze objednat menu... | Naprosta katastrofa! Zaprve nechapu, proč je nutnost mit internet k tomu, abych si mohl načíst číslo zakaznickou kartu (QR kod) při vytváření objednávky. Zadruhé je ta apka neskutečně pomalá. Musel jsem při objednávce čekat víc než 2 minuty než se mi načetla, abych mohl využít zakaznickeho bonusu. Naprosto triskni...mel jsem sto chuti jit vedle na Salaterii než s timhle bojovat. | Avoid using this app. You cant log in using google account, it will just take you back to login screen, but when paying using google pay, it will get stucked on confirm payment screen (which is only demo payment screen) and if you confirm it, it wont order anything but might take your money without giving you food. Just don't use this | nejde platit pres tu apku tak se ani nenajite bo si nic neobjednate, gpay nefara | In order to see Menu, you need to choose an address - would be better to be able to see menu before starting any ordering. Would be nice for the app to provide my account address as choice when making order, instead of needing to put a delivery address from blank. I personally find the app interface to have very large elements, making it hard to navigate the Menu. | Tuto aplikaci mam jenom jako nahradu obsolentni fyzicke karty, a dela vsechno daleko hur nez karta samotna. Aplikace se nacita dlouho, qr kod je az na posledni zalozce a terminaly ho pravidelne spatne skenuji/nevidi. Obecne je aplikace asi ok, ale od bageterie jako takove bych ocenoval alternativu vytukani cisel manualne jako tomu bylo do ted, qr kod vsechno jenom vyrazne zpomaluje a zneprijemnuje | Plastovy karticky koncej, ale nemuzu si ji prevest do appky, protoze jsem pred 10 lety pouzival jiny email a jen buh vi jaky. Dobra prace! :) | Telefoní číslo? Proč potřebujete telefoní číslo? Budete mi snad volat? Chci jen ISIC slevu, nechci vám dávat všechny své osobní údaje! | Terrible experience ordering with the app. Nowadays, the screen kiosks are also somehow bugged to the point where you can enter your BB card only when you wake it up. When I tried the app, I could only insert the coupon, and by inserting it, all my BB points went away, and I'm from free baguette to 0 points. There are multiple bugs that need fixing! Quite alarming for an app that is supposed to be used extensively in interactions with the merchant. | Aplikace je relativně pomalá na to, že prakticky ""jenom"" zobrazuje obrázky. Při objednání menu s nápojem jiným než ice tea se započítá cena za bagetu + patatas + nápoj, místo cena za menu + rozdíl v ceně nápoje, jako je to u kiosku. Nyní také zmizel caesar salát, ač u kiosku šel objednat. | Nefunguje | Overall, this should be a useful app. I am a frequent customer with a MyBB card, however, I am unable to register for the app because I have a UK (+44) mobile number. Please remove this restriction. | 2x jsem chtel zkusit kupóny, 2x se v apce nenacetly. Je to tak pomalé, ze je to nepoužitelné. Mate novy slogan - Fast food, slow app. Apka Vám kazí jmeno, otravuje zákazníky. Mate to zapotřebí? | Sleva na první objednávku nejde uplatnit, aplikace nic moc | Bruh, nefunguje nic. | Coupons doesnt works at ordering kiosks.show as invalid coupons | Naprosto zbytečná aplikace. Místo toho abych si normálně zašel na oběd a dostal na bagetu pár korun studentskou slevu tak musím řešit na co je zrovna kupón jestli platí jen na dovoz nebo na i pobočce.

How came? | Used to love this app, but now keeps asking me to accept or reject cookies, who wants cookies!!! This time it makes you go down a long never ending list!! So I uninstall it!! Very disappointing! | very detailed for hourly updates | good | I am so happy with the precise predictions | The weather is great! | good functionalities fit a free app. The UX could be improved though to make it easier to use | Not accurate for NZ in spite of its claims. Uninstalling. | Cool | Great app | Great app | very informative | excelente | exelent | Good 👍 | Very useful and generally accurate with a thorough 14 day forecast which is great. Easy to use. | 80 is my address, not 78 ?? | Very satisfied with the app so far. Seems to be accurate and has additional excellent features. I'm using the free version. The ads don't bother me. | Forecast is wrong. | I love Meteored, i have been finding all the information really helpful and it is more reliable than B.O.M. | a good weather guide | haven't had this app long enough to rate it a 5 star but will give it a 4 star for now. i like many things about it. | This has been quite an accurate weather app. Would recommend to others. | 👍 | u need to update your gps it doesnt know my address but it knows every other house i go to and its full of adds its ok when it knows the address im guessing u have to buy so called premium to get your own proper address hahahahha | 👍👍👍👍👍 | Pretty good app but ads are super scammy. I get the need for ads to support a product but ones that lead to malware are not cool. Uninstalled the app after getting a ""Your phone has updates available"" fake ad. | great app | Very good. | brilliant app. | Very good | handy to know what to expect in the weather each day | Thank you | Awesome App. for weather... | awesome 👌 | Too much ads | very good | What a great app to have!! It helps me when I travel. | Great app so far subscribed premium finding one negative. That would be lack of radar choice on Main Screen , it only provides satellite view. Some customization allowing user to add Weather Radar map would be nice. | Love this app 😊 | Brilliant ! And accurate! Tried many- this from every aspect is the best!!( especially for an 86yr old!! ) cannot think of any way it could be improved. .well done.! | It is a good app , lots of information, by far the most complete weather app I have used | 80 % correct | I really like the layout. You can find what you need without having to go through numerous menu options and ads. | Very good app, daily weather predictions are nice and clear and detailed. One of the best, | Inputting my home addresses for the app and it refuses to accept the address and not only that, it refuses to accept the city that I input. My address must always be correct. I may lower the score again if this does not get correct. | great | I love it | great value! clean layout, easy to read, and more accurate than other weather apps I've tried. | Good and reliable weather app. | Good for keeping up to date with my morn temps | best and most accurate one I have ever used | seems quite accurate. great display. | Don't want to see news and videos in a weather app! At least have an option to hide sections I don't want to see... | I like very much I will use it again | Good app. | best weather app I've had. very accurate. | Great app, and quite accurate. | Great app | Wow its so well designed it makes the day brighter .The other apps are so badly designed I'm never certain what day it refers to for weather . They seem incapable of putting the name of the day clearly on top of the weather forcast . | Not accurate at all! | After trying about six weather apps, I chose this one. The one I had no longer exists. The search was a little frustrating but that search is done. I'm glad I found this one. | Thanks for the excellent work | Great design | O melhor app do tempo em Portugal! | Best weather app hands down, especially when travelling overseas. Very comprehensive and as accurate as a weather app can be. Great job. Was well worth going premium too. | I have found this weather forecast site to be very good | really good 👍 informative and helpful, there when I need weather reports for the day | it nice to have meteored.to find out what the whether | the very best weather reports ever first class | superbly accurate | radar doesn't seem very accurate, sorry | Great 👍 a very good look 2 it | nice app | clear graphics, easy to read | Quality forecast app, with good information which is usually accurate | Very awesome | Nice Weather App | I only want weather. no news or ads | no advertising | Wow! This is a very well layed out weather app! The only thing missing is a 4 x 1 widget that shows icon and current temp, high and low, current time with current location above it. | It was 5 stars, as soon as I gave the app a 5 star rating, I got a full screen video ad, so it just lost a star. | So far so good, I hate adds so I went premium straight up. Cheap for the year. I've only had it for a couple of weeks (the heatwave) so I'm yet to see how it handles a '4s in 1d' scenario. | better and more accurate than weather bug | Best weather forecaster yet | Great app | The app is on point with weather location on the other hand needs help it gets my address but then switch the name which only a suber area | This is the most accurate Weather app that I have found for my locality. I love the tremendous level of detailed data presented, and now it works correctly with tablets, and the spurious icons (e.g. Humidity icon with an incorrectly associated 18° temperature value) have now been removed allowing the correct icons and their values to be displayed. Devs were a bit slow in responding, presumably to fit in with their work and release cycle, but they've fixed it as requested | Awesome, pretty accurate. | 👍 | i love it accurate forecast all the time | well rounded app, great for use when wind monitoring is needed | Fantastic to change the Devils tone of modern music to a harmonious frequency for us. | pretty good | Great app for weather forecast 99% coreect forecast | love this app | very good | Very accurate and precise! | best Weather App | GREAT! | the best weather ap I have ever used! it gives you the correct wind speed/gusts. now I don't have to go into the national weather database. | good | Purchased Pro version, but didn't refresh on Samsung Galaxy 23 ultra . | Accurate and an excellent weather app. But don't have the humidity information. I hope it will be upgraded with all necessary informations. | so far I like it. will update more later | love this app it's got very relevant and accurate information. highly recommend | Those 800+ advertising companies, lots of suspicious names in that list. Even if I refuse them all, seeing the other reviews where the devs beg us to let them sell our data doesn't instill trust. | thanks for accuracy | I've tried other apps and this one is the most accurate. When it says rain it will rain in within 5 minutes of the time specified. When other apps say rain it means sometimes during the day it could rain between 1 minute and 10 hours | Store says this app has a watch tile, but that seems to be false. | Awesome app! Great info and detail | It kept thinking I was 10+ miles away so I tried to get into the settings and found an INSANE number of companies to block, if you don't want them sharing your data with them ....and you have to do it twice. I spent probably 20+ minutes going through the first list, rejecting all these advertising (aka spying) companies, only to come to a second huge list. I gave up, and just uninstalled the whole app. This is absurd. I might've kept it if there was an easy way to reject all of them at once. | Good | Love the layout. So easy to access. | nice working app | You not only got the forecast for today wrong, but you didn't even give an accurate temperature of the NOW temperature. What has weather forecasting accuracy changed in the past 100 years? Doppler Radar has made it worse. You went from 10 minutes Tornado warning to 15 minutes warning in 100 years. People pay a high price to become a Meteorologist , which means what?? They still can't get an accurate 3 day forcast. | A really fast and so far accurate prediction nice1 thanx | I love this app and more especially I love the satellite images of the prevailing weather system. | amazing and most complete weather app. | very accurate | It's a gr8 app and it's not too expensive to sub, thank you for all your hard work. I still can't find the humidity! | very good app tells me what I want to know. I would recommend it. | So far so good, easy to use, all information I need accessible | easy to navigate and understand | It is not very accurate for Chile, which free one is better? | LUV!! | no option to hide redundant address or clock elements from widgets | works great and lots of info. plenty of days ahead forecast | perfect weather report❤ | lts the Best Weather app I've ever had! | great weather app | Awesome weather app ever!! It forecasts the hourly weather thus letting you know what to expect in the next hour. Never a bad day with Meteored. | quick and quiet accurate | Great | Veri nice | This is normally a great app. Not sure what's gone wrong exactly but every time I try to enter a location, it flashes an error up on the bottom of the screen (obscuring the keyboard!!) saying something about it's location services having issues. This has been going on for days if not weeks now. Turned a great app into a useless one. | great | Nice so far.. | The app is very good so far. Installed Tues 5 March 2024. Previously the app showed the time and temperature. Now it shows the app Icon which has to be tapped to open the weather details for my home location. Is it possible to return to showing the time & weather details rather than having to tap on the app Icon to see the weather details ? | Why should it make me happy?? | Nice weather app, all the info I need about the coming weather | I tried lot's of weather aap but I found this aap is very accurate and reliable and trustworthy | So detelled | Clean and easy to read | Brilliant app wind direction warnings of rain also, the whole job, thank you. | awesome app!!! bang on with rain radar! | Awesome app apart from Google's adds | Easy to access reliable information. | works well but occasionally doesn't update weather till open it | Easy app with less ads and more versatile.

Only one thing needs improvent: my eyesight's not great, so the lack of icon and font size control options on the widgets is problematic.

The only thing is it will not update its location automatically. All settings are enabled for it to do that, but it has problems. I have to open the app for a chance that it will update its location.

Great user interface, accurate location that can follow you if you want, radar map available, future forecast by the hour, just any and all info you want in a user friendly app. Plus an alert feature. This is a keeper."",""Exceptional weather app, including 2 week projection. I discovered and used this app last year to plan a trip to Prague, CZ. It has a routine that can make extremely long range predictions, based on 70 years of collected weather data! This helped decide which time frame would have the best chance of accommodating weather for my wife and I. As things evolved, had to cancel our trip for medical reasons. I liked this service so much, I adopted it as my go-to weather app. I used to use NOAA's app.""]",false,false,false,"aplicacion.tiempo","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aplicacion.tiempo&hl=en&gl=CZ"

It used to be great and work prefectly, what happened? 😢 | data from 2 radars, only | Na novejsich androidech vetsinu casu widget neni vubec videt. edit: zda de, ze jsou novy widgety | Nový design se opravdu nepovedl, dá se nějakým způsobem obnovit ten starý? | Does not work. No data is shown. Just an empty map ;-( | Is there a way to avoid screen rotation? | After upgrade almost does not work 😞 | Aplikace dobra, redesign se povedl. Ocenil bych softwarove tlacitko pro manualni aklualizaci (refresh). Good app with nice redesign, but missing refresh buttot. | Vítejte mezi živými, pořád tuhle appku mám rád i po 8 letech, tady máte 5 hvězdiček 🙂 | New design was well needed. App functionality is as great as usual. Number one app to know when and how heavy it will rain. | It was too much better before this new design. I reinstalled apps and widget is still on bad shape. | Po posledním update nefunguje widget. | Nová appka vypadá skvěle! | Pokud někomu nejde widget v nové verzi ať apku odinstaluje a nainstalujte znova,.vše ok | hmm widget stal uz predtim za prd... ale po updatu nebyl videt... po odebrani a pridani cant load widget a konec... mozna by bylo super zapracovat na velikosti.. protoze na obrazovce se to vejde uplne na prd... co se tyce vyuziti mista 2x3... stejny mozna vetsi problem s velikosti ma bohuzel i aladin... mno snad se ro zlepsi grafika v nahledu vypada lepe.... ale nejde update: po reinstalu ok. i nastaveni widgetu se zda lepsi nez bylo. tak jeste aladina widget poladit | Another uglification project. You really think this ""redesign* would impress anybody? Downgraded and frozen the app to never update again. It still works, that'a why it's not 1* (i hate when dev is enforcing new bs design whem the old was sufficient) | Was bugged after update, reinstall helped and seems to be working nice now | Great app, been using it for years. The redesign is great. Had to reinstall the app to fix new widget loading (deleting app data didn't help). | Finally! New widget what work even on android 11! New design! Thanks! | Funguje skvele, ale novy design je humus.... Nechapu proc jsou vsichni na vetvi z tehle radoby moderne vypadajicich nesmyslu. Aspon kdyby widget vypadal stejne, ty novy jsou fakt hnus. A totez ikona. Jeste ze se da nainstalovat stara verze. A ted jdu zalohovat soucasnou verzi Aladina, protoze pocitem ze ho brzo zmrsite stejnym zpusobem. | Je to skvela a uzitecna mapka, nicmene ma obcasne problemy s funkcnosti widgetu. Na priklad nyni po posledni aktualizaci. Pomohla odinstalace a reinstalace. Pokud by se nekdo potykal s podobnym problemem. | IT used to link to Aladin module. Not aby Linger. What a Shane. | Moc krásně předělaná verze 4.0.13 z října 2020! Tak ještě teď Aladina, prosím. S UV indexem. | Snad jediná aplikace s pořádaným widgetem! Nová verze se povedla... | Vypadá výborne | Skvělý nový UI. líbí se mi - praktická dostupnost ostatních appek, možnost přepnutí podkladové mapy. Dobrá práce. | Nový dizajn dizajn potešil. Super vec mať vlastný radar na mobile resp. prístup naň. | Was great app. Untill the last update | Poznámky k verzi 4.0.10 z 22/10/2020: - jak nastavit vlastni pozice a nezobrazovat pozici radaru? predchozi verze to umela v nastaveni; - jak zakazat zobrazovani animace predpivedi? v v predchozi verzi to slo zakazat nastaveni. Diky | Long time user, the redesign looks great! | Why can't be installed without location permissions?? | Aktualizací bylo trhání opraveno, už jede vše plynule. | Nový design je moc pěkný a už bylo na čase ho aktualizovat, ovšem na Oneplus 8 Pro s Android 11 aplikace nefunguje (nenačítá data o srážkách, nefunguje pohybování se po časové ose). | App redesign a šup 3 nová oprávnění a ani slovo o nich. Nefér! EDIT 2020-10-01 Výborně tedy o tom ani nevíte nebo netušíte? Vidím to stejně na Android 9 i 10: NOVÉ spuštění služeb na popředí, bránění přechodu telefonu do režimu spánku a Play Install Referrer API | Radar nemusí ukazovat vždy přesně. Ale používam společně s aplikací počasí abych měl okolo sebe přehled. | Genialne jednoduche. Skoda, ze neobsahuje informace o blesku. | Na Galaxy S10 se nezobrazuje mapový podklad, takže netuším na jak velké území se koukám. Chtělo by aktualizaci pro nové Androidy... | Great app... I use it many years. Unfortunately on Samsung S20+ widget doesn't work correctly. | Widgets don't work on my pixel 4 | Not showing any data for more than two weeks. | Not reliable even 10 minutes ahead. Sometimes, you look at it, it's supposed to rain but it doesn't. | V poslední době zcela nesmyslné a nespolehlivé předpovědi teploty i srážek. | Only positive about this app. | Perfektna | Skvela aplikace, ale bohuzel widget je na novejsich verzich Androidu casto neviditelny. Prosim autory o opravu. | It's really useful when you want to know sth about weather in first 20-30 minutes, cuz then it's accurate,but when you want to know weather in 2-3 hours, you will be surprised, because if you don't pay for it, as free app you're able to see only what will happen in first 50 minutes. Of course when you'll see some dark clouds in another country and it will head for your country, you still will know when it beat your home, but it can change its way fast and disappear, so then it's not so accurate. | Widget has still issues after update to Android 10 @Samsung s10e :( Usually it is not visible at all. | Jedna z nejspolehlivějších aplikací. Jednoduchá, čistá, užitečná. Ještě mě nezklamala. Vždy fungovala zcela spolehlivě. A to na několika zařízeních :) | Výborný, ale po posledním update (asi na android 10) Samsung 9 widget přestal fungovat. Snad dojde k aktualizaci. | It seems there are no actual radar data since about three weeks ago. Or is it only me who can't see them? | Beznadějně zastaralé, nefunkční a nepoužitelné (Android 10). | Is there a europe module for this, or only czech republic? | Widget nefunguje na android 10 | Update: Skvelá aplikácia pre CZ. Zo všetkých vyskúšaných sa ovláda najlepšie. Škoda, že je len pre CZ. | Why there is no radar data recently? | 😊 | Useless - data not accurate at all not even for the current time (I'm not even talking about forcast - even couple of hours ahead). | Cant install this app | It is pity that the app only show the Czech Republic and does not work abroad.  I love the widget and the finger scroll thru time | Good app but sometimes doesn't work - not showing data even if it's obviously storm coming and radar data checked from another source shows something else... , however, it's just for a few last days... | Widget update isn't stable, also often disappear from screen. | widget not working on android 9 :-( | Po updatu na android 8 mizí widget. | Just works as expected. | Radar pěkný, aplikace funguje výborně. Škoda že data jsou teď z nějakého celoevropského obrázku v obdélníkovém výřezu, myslím že ta 2 kolečka kolem radarů v Brdech a v Bukové pro mě byla užitečnější, bylo vidět dál do Rakouska. A ještě bych si k vánocům přál blesky, mapa už tam je, tak to nebude těžký.. Díky. | Great app, however widget doesnt work properly on Android 8.1. | Not available in my area | Dneska mraky na obloze ale zadne na radaru :-( | Simple app with great source of radar data. Please add at least 24 hours 
history of radar images in order to be able to know whether there was a 
rainfall in previous hours. 12 images is only last 2 hours, which is 
tragically short timespan. Thank you in advance! | Mapa nefunguje ani po aktualizaci,  vidím jen mapquest tiles not available | Bohuzel ukazuje obcas značně neaktualni data ze stare predpovedi (i po aktualizaci). Dnes venku aktualne 4 stupne a aplikace tvrdi pres 10 :-( | Widget nefunguje na Android Oreo. Jako ryhly workaround staci nastavit na /data/user/0/org.androworks.meteor a podadresare pristupova prava pro zapis a cteni libovolnym uzivatelem (nezapomente na X bit pro slozky). Vice v logcatu. | Widgets do not work on Android Oreo. | Useknuté mapy zhora aj zdola. Cez WEB stránku je to vporiadku. PREČO???? Ináč by to bolo O.K. | Useknute mapy pre Sk. Na oreu je veľmi nestabilná a vyzerá že update je v nedohľadne. Treba prejsť na niečo iné. | I don't like it | Říkali bez reklam, lhali | Důvod, proč je toto pouze pro obdélník kolem ČR jde mimo mě.. pokud se oblačnost pohybuje ze severozápadu a bydlíte v severních Čechách, je vám radar naprosto k *** Jinak ale super aplikace.. | Výborná aplikace | podarena appka, pouzivam aj na kus slovenska :) | Nothing apear on main screen,like wheather.The photos under the Read more links are fake.Only the radar works...sorry jako! | Super | Super. Nešel by prosím přidat widget s měnitelnou velikostí? | ...dokud nevyskočila pop-up reklama přes většinu screenu. Nechutné | Super aplikace, škoda občasných reklam na ostatní aplikace při spouštění. | Aplikace skvělá, jen škoda že zobrazuje jen srážkový radar. Hodila by se i oblačnost (ideálně i dělená nízká střední vysoká). Ale nevím, zda je licence na data z těchto satelitů dostupná. | Velmi užitečná aplikace👍 | Supr | Works vzry Nice | Moc kratky casovy horizont. | Aplikace bezne zobrazuje ze v miste me polohy prsi - neni to v 60% pravda. Nespolehlive. | Perfektni aplikace | Perfektne funguje! Pouzivam ho kazdodenne na ruzne sportovne aktivity | Nice and useful tool | Though it only covers the north of Austria, there is no other app that shows live rain radar maps. | Pecka!! | Pecka | Starts automaticaly with internet every time. Stays in the memory all the time. Cant kill it. Uninstall. | Krátký horizont, ale velmi přesný | Prestalo ukazovat budoucnost. Pls opravit. | Horrible  Does not work will not set the right loacation | Pure Rubbish | Thanks | Sure would be nice if these apps would be specific about where they work and where they don't. It could be the best ever weather app but I'll never know because it doesn't work in North America | Nice app | Would be great if the app could cover at least whole central Europe. | Downloaded this app before going to c Venice and Lake Garda only to discover it does not cover southern Europe. Northern Europe and I suspect. The States (as usual) It will be fine. | Pura verga | Second times applying for Galaxy tablet as first choice. | Všechno funguje. Akorát bacha na transparentní srážky. Stalo se mi, že jsem omylem kliknul na maximální transparency a pak jsem žil 14 dní v tom, že nikde neprší. | But why did you turn off this small piece of Poland?  Now it sucks | good | Od včera prestala ukazovať dáta pre juhozápadné Slovensko :-( a časť Moravy ... (neviem či je to iba náhoda, ale) onedlho po mojom povzdychu sa udiala náprava ... VĎAKA ... Back to 5 stars :-) | Dříve bylo možné sledovat přesnou shodu radaru se skutečným průběhu srážek. V poslední době radar několikrát ukazoval srážky a nedopadla ani kapka. Možná se slabé srážky mohou vypařit ještě nad zemí, ale pak by bylo potřeba takto údaje prezentovat. | Not working at india | Great | why is the USA not on this? Uninstalling its worthless to me. | Drive byla aplikace presnejsi. Aktualne aplikace ukazuje v me lokaci bezny dest az silnejsi srazky (svetle zelena, zluta az oranzova). Ve skutecnosti sviti slunce. :-( | It's the best application for people who's going to ride a bike. I always see before go out. | Simply the best weather forecast app | does not support north america | Don't work for the uk, uninstaling | Už tolikrát mi interpretace dat z radaru zachránila suchou kůži, že nemohu ohodnotit jinak než plným počtem | Nice work | It wouldn't go to ameica | Yes | Great app if you sray in CZ | Skvělá aplikace, idealni na planovani venkovnich aktivit. | Už přes rok čekám na to, kdy si autoři uvědomí přechod na moderní Android UI. Po funkční stránce bez problémů, vzhled je ale ostuda... | Would not work | very goos app.... | Love it! | Super slow | Simply brilliant after the last update. If you are able to convince CHMU or even SHMU to come up with a detailed weather forecast, you deserve 6*! |  | Nefunguje interní mapa. | Po posledním updatu mapa konečně funguje bezchybně, díky! | Hey so it does work for lg optimus ls670 thats alot of info from a pic  have that type of phone | Opravdu velmi uzitece, zvlaste PRI planovani nasich outdoorovych aktivit. | Enough said! | Chybí mi autostart animace a stahovani jiného počtu snímků přes wifi a přes mobilní síť. Taky bych uvítal kdyby se po tuknuti na inkonu aplikace vždy spustil meteoradar a nikoli Aladin,  budj se má jednat o jednu aplikaci, ale pokud jsou samostatné tak toto chování je nejapné. | Nefunguje mi na Androidu 4.0 :-(, na 2.x mi slapala :-/. | radarova data maji nejakou hloupou pruhlednost a zmena nastaveni nic nedela. tak nevim | Slúži presne tak ako má, maximálna spokojnosť! | stupid. | Naprosto perfektní appka | Používám často, ale po update na nové mapy se použitelnost zhoršila. A když už jsem tady : V Meteoru je update jako refresh, v Aladinu jako update. Přidat custom polohu v Meteoru nejde jinak nežli GPS koordináty, v Aladinu si to vyhledá pěkně ze seznamu. | Rychlá a jednoducha... | Must have for everyone in Czech Republic | good | But slow on tablets | Only sometimes even when clouds are on the sky, meteor does not show them. It's for a few days now, seems like some of the rdars are broken or something. Also sometimes images are loaded really slowly even though the Internet connection is good. Otherwise very nice | No language choice No data displayed No weather report | Svuj učel splnil! | That's moor lik it | Nice | very good weather view. I suggest! | However needs a tiny improvements. | Vynikající pro předpověď počasí v ČR. | Super... 100% | Dùng rất hay | Potreba ukazat na delsi dobu dopredu ne jen pul hodiny, predpoved na cely den | Perfected | Mash sain | Only 1 location | Its very good app has much more feature | Vyborna aplikace. Pouzivam ji velmi casto. Aladin model je uzitecny doplnek. Jen mi docela chybi detekce blesku celdn. Bylo by fajn kdyby ji autori pridali. | Well good app, but i hate when apps have the 24 time hours insted of 12 hours. Can you atleast add that in the settings? | It is nice and very clear in india too. Caricaturist Sugumarje | Ideální v kombinaci s Alain modelem | . | Perfect! | Bohužel v poslední verzi přestalo fungovat zobrazení polohy. Na widgetu funguje. | Really useful app! Much better than standard forecasts.. | Ale prestal mi fungovat kompas ikdyz v jinych aplikacich funguje.A zda se, ze radar v Cechach nyni neposkytuje data | Weather forecast program | Na mobilu htc funguje bezproblemove, ale na tabletu bez GPS modulu hlasi chybu aplikace a nelze spustit...mozna fix at neni potrebe gps modul ?:/ | What is this | Občas vidím jak se na mě valí mraky a aplikace nic nezobrazuje.

Love it!!"",""It's a decent app. It has its trouble recognizing stuff half the time, giving only things with vague color schemes as results, but I'm going to chalk it up to the technology not being as advanced as it could be, maybe bc of the budget. You used to be able to select text quite easily but they have removed it unless it is translated or the text is recognized in the original language, which it has gotten worse at :/ It was really useful and kinda bummed to see it gone."",""It's not perfect, but it's certainly does help when you are looking for people who are trying to scam you. I love to do screenshots and then an immediate reverse search using my share app after the picture is taken. I go immediately to lens and then I look up the person and see who the person might really be. It works a lot! But there are still some hiccups and I'm sure they'll eventually get worked out."",""When you use lens to translate the words or characters in a picture, it usually does it accurately and a good job but it unsymmetrically blocks it and stacks. So there's different shapes that kind of overlay the tops and bottoms of the other words below or beside them. sometimes I can't select every single one of the words because of this overlay of uneven boxes and the way that they're stacked or lay over each other's edges. If you're using it to reverse search image it works great 90% of time.""]",false,false,false,"com.google.ar.lens","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.lens&hl=en&gl=CZ"

I had to use mastercard instead. | App is ok, but the prices TWICE more expensive than in other shops. Makes no sense to use it. | So far it's been great to use, but there's an issue now. The app seems to be refreshing every X seconds and each time it does, the list of items I'm shopping goes back to the begging and I have to scroll down to where I left off... Please review this bug, as it is rather annoying. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S21 5G and my app is up to date.

Recommendations work great too! | I think it is one of the coolest apps for women. They have a very large range of clothes, accesories, etc and the prices are good. Even if they are a bit more expensive, i like the quality and the fact that i can always give them back and get my money back. So, thumbs up from me! | I like this app thank you about you | Nice | I really like this app, which is easy to navigate and order. Would be nice if you could read people's opinions about the clothing instead of just seeing their rating. I have ordered and returned more than once and never had any kind of problems,on the contrary, they usually process my orders faster than promised 😊 The only thing that could really be improved is the size advice on the boots. It would be very useful to have the circumference of the ankle and the top of the boots plus the height | Great app to order clothes or shoes. | Sent wrong item | payment had to be restarted about 20 times until it finally worked since the app always kept closing. tried with all payment methods, all the same. after an hour of struggle I finally got it to work. | Odlično | Good choices with a few flaws.

It's always easy to return an item if it's not the right size or you just change your mind. Refunds are advised over mail as well. The best is the great choice of items and brands. | Great service. | trag in aplicatia voastra, nimic nu merge | I have been using this app for almost 3 years and i had no problems with it. The products are a good, as well as the prices. There are a lot of costum deals that they give you and they are useful every once in a while. I recommend!! | Great experience so far, will continue to shop here! | Am comandat un cadou pe 13 și încă nu a venit! Nici nu a fost predata comanda curierului. Rușine. Sunteți cei mai praf din Romania 👎 | I like About you | fast easy good price | Good product as they shown and the delivery is good | During Black Friday promotion I ordered 14 products in 1 order. The order was confirmed. After waiting for 2 weeks I contacted the support to check on my order. They said that my order will not be completed due to a mistake on their end. They made me fill out a form I guess just so they can protect themselves. After almost a month and a huge hassle with 42 emails in total I received none of the ordered products. They promised me a 30% coupon and a refund. I still haven't received any coupon. | Great app | The best Shopping app | I love it | Easy to use | obuća dolazi u neorginalnom pakiranju, veličinom i kvalitetom ogromne razlike od orginala.

There are many other apps where I order sg from, and I get it in 1-2 days. Here it is different! I always have to wait at least a week, then if I have some problems with the items, it takes so long to get my money back! This time I had to ask them about the items I sent back, and after two days of waiting, I only got an automatic message!

Po zadání rezervace eReceptu není později nikde v aplikaci vidět seznam všech takto zadaných rezervací (tedy něco jako „odeslaná pošta“ v emailových systémech). A z toho důvodu ani není vidět stav v jakém se rezervace eReceptu nachází. To dělá největší problém v případě, že není v možnostech lékárny požadovaný lék sehnat (nikde a nijak). V tomto případě by měla moji rezervaci stornovat a tím i „uvolnit“ eRecept pro to, abych ho mohl zkusit uplatnit v jiných lékárnách. Ale jestli k tomu již došlo se v této aplikaci bohužel nikdy nijak nedozvím. Takže nezbývá, než jim zkusit klasicky telefonovat a až se konečně dovolám, tak se s nimi nějak domluvit. A dále mi tam chybí možnost (kterou již dávno běžně umožňuje většina eShopů) pro případ, kdy na receptu je více, než jedna položka. V tomto případě bych potřeboval mít možnost zadat, jestli požaduji dodání celého receptu naráz nebo po jednotlivých položkách (v případě, kdy dodání jedné z položek bude trvat déle, než u těch ostatních). A nakonec ještě detail (vzhledem k předchozím nedostatkům) – všechny dnešní kvalitní aplikace by měly podporovat i tzv. „tmavý“ režim zobrazení (tedy světlý text na tmavém pozadí), který je dle mého názoru i šetrnější pro oči. | Kdybych mohl, dam nula hvezdicek.

"PlantNet Plant Identification","Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand! Pl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it. 

Pl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads or cacti. Pl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature of course but also those that grow on the sidewalks of our cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!

The more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. Flowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant (or the tree if it is one!) is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.  

At present Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. Don't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.

The new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:
- The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.
- The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).
- The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application. 
- The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.
- The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.
- The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.
- The mapping of your observations.
- Links to many factsheets.

The web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/","Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone.

I rated 5 stars because I had a great experience with this app. Highly recommended from my side 10/10. | Excellant | Good I love this app | Very hard to use to get care and identification of plants, weeds and help on fertilizer, repotting various plants and lighting. | Does not work only shows error | Amazing | This is the best app. | I love that application ❤️ | A very nice app for an amateur botanist. Helps me a great deal to correctly classify a species which I only vaguely know. What's amazing is also,that you can get to know species which are totally unknow to you, e.g., when you're traveling abroad, far away from your local flora. | Very accurate | More Australian natives being recognised | Good functionality and features, works well with no significant issues. It's very much better than many of the other plant identification apps and is completely free to use. | Great app. Very useful | It's been accurate and helpful the several times I've used it. | Very helpful in identifying plants about which I have no knowledge but sometimes not absolutely definitive. | I've learned so many great things by using this app! Thank you! | This would be a very good app if it allowed choosing language other than 
the OS. To be blunt: For some reason it only gives you plant names in the 
same language as your Android. Duh :-( | Much faith in this apps accuracy | Good overall | Great accuracy and very easy to use! | Love this app so much. | Finds it every time | Excellent app. Identification is spot on. | Best identifying app | Pretty accurate | Only totally free plant identifier app I've found. So far free anyway. | Excellent | Despite being my favourite app so far I give it 4 stars in hopes that you'll add the features and details of plant care(ph,soil, fertilizer,watering, sunlight, season) and disease identification. Then it'll be a complete app and we won't need to Google every plant that we identify with this app. All the best. | Excellent! | Poor | This is a really great app to help identify plants, weeds and herbs. | Location didn't work. Kept suggesting Singapore while I'm in UK. | Mostly the app identifies accurately | Good app | Fantastic | It works great | Awesome app. Very accurate and helpful. | Basic and Useful | Sadly when loading a picture from the gallery the app freezes and closes down. When I reopen the app the pictures where loaded but ID was uncertain even when the whole inflorescense was visible and sharply defined. I really want to use this app. What's up? | Wonderful app, perfect for nature walks! Takes very sharp photographs, and the identification is always accurate. | Wonderful app for beginners | Got it right o the nose! | Excellent | Using it for last few years and it's a great and very helpful app. Till now all my plant identification was successful and accurate with these app | Very good | Having the background I can discern which ones most are after looking up on the app. Plantnet so far helps remind me on the plant name and species even if some pictures aren't as good. Thanks for providing suggestions. | Fantastic resource,so easy to use. | it's good but only for identification | Its a great app. | It's amazing and timely | Excellent citizen science app. I'm in Australia so expecting it to have some gaps in the flora data base, but users get to submit plants they can identify for inclusion. More users will improve the Australian collection. | Love this app! Really helps identify plants. | All over good | Nice appearance, stellar execution. No bombarding ads, yet install severely lacks basic instruction, leaving users guessing what & how to proceed. As another user said, tons of other's nearly useless photos consuming space. Are they combined in identification of plants, or merely for visual enjoyment? Much of this is great, some I don't see how to use. It is very useful. | Excellent Garden Helper | Great App!! Very handy when you don't know what you're looking at | One of the best apps for plant identification. It is completely free and has no adverts. Sounds to good to be true but I haven't experienced any issues with it. | I have got a wonderful experience from this application. It gives detailed information about species that are identified. Especially It is very useful to agronomists and people working with plants. It is the real identifier of plants!! | I love it and it's helping me a lot 🙂🙂 | great app. | Great job | Helped me identify heaps of plants. Love from Australia 🇦🇺 | Easy to use and very impressed at accuracy | Very good excellence | Nice | good | Hell yeH | Fantastic for garden plants worldwide. Simple and informative. Not so useful for Australian natives but at least helps ID the weeds! | 1000/10, cannot recommend this app enough! It's all open-source, and has a very consistent and high rate of identification. It's helped me identify a whole host of plants, so I know which ones are safe for my cat to chomp when I'm not looking. | I had already tested several types of plants the result was exact. Thanks | Has been excellent, so have recommended to many others | Excelent, i went through a lot of apps to find one that helped me identify a herb i needed for a tea. This one is perfect, just perfect | Great App! Convenient and works even if the plants are not native of the region you live in. The collaborative nature of the app is not 100% reliable though. You have to scroll down a bit from the first choice and observe carefully details to eventually identify the right species. But overall wonderful app, I cannot complain! | Nice project and identifier, but no data about caring | Worked on plant that was matured and dried out. | The accuracy of this app in identifying plants is really good 👍 | Everyday useful, almost always right | Great app and easy application Thanks | Great app | Working great! Amazing UI and just Great overall | Awesome | Excelent | Handy and free | Great App, identified 2 herb and 2 houseplants as well as a chilli plant. Another app asking for £7 a month. This is tremendous for free. I'm busy watching YouTube Bushcraft, where people are growing and farming exotic fruit and veg. I use this app to capture and identify produce. It is very accurate and so far, no failures. | Wring plant names | Mixed results | Very accurate | Very good app | Very useful in identifying plants | Best app | I think it's a great app but it would be good to have a audio icon that we can play so we can learn how to pronounce the latin | I read the info on this app before purchase. I thought it provided guidance on using it. I also thought it would identify my specific plant rather than compare my photo with hundreds in its database and ask me to pick which one was mine. That really isn't helpful to me. I also thought it would provide all the specifics for planting, light, watering fertilizing, and propagating. If it does all this, what am I not doing to get that from this app? | It's acurate all the plants that you searched and no ads free to search | Wonderful | This one is truly amazing, it helps me a lot to identify my plants, and it provides a lot of useful information and related pictures, thanks a lot | It's the best I have used! | Nice one | Very accurate and helpful | Amazing app. | Does an incredibly accurate ID job and I'm using a phone from 2017! | Great | Very good identifier | I'm not good at recognizing The name's or what is it | No subscription and it figured it out anyway. I approve. | Awesome and easy. Very accurate and in Costa Rica so far it helps and does identify a lot of plants and flowers | Bug report v3.17.4 This version does not read the GPS info of photos. The same photos' GPS location can be created by Google Photos and by iNaturelist | Noticeable lower usage starting latter half of 2023. | Amazing programme. It misses a bit of a database and organisational side but it works really well. It has not been trained well in recognising tropical plants of the Amazon basin | Fair but some time don't get detailed | A very good experience. Highly recommend. | Very helpfulf, I learned a lot of plant names | Quite good flower and leaf also | I'm very happy with it. It's easy to take a picture or upload a photo of the plant you want to identify once you are in an area with internet. Much easier to use than other apps with the same purpose. I do wish they had more info on the plants after they are identified but at least I can find out their names much faster than trying to use a book. | It's the best one | This aap is very helpful aap.We use this aap in our daily life and this is also very informative aap. Plant is essential elements in our life, we can't live without plants.This app help us lot. Thank you | No camera recognition | Great sop! | A very useful app. I definately recommend it | my favorite app. it identifies plants and has a plant list, family, genus, and species based on world zones | Overall incredibly accurate and easy to use. | Such a good app for plant lovers ...but it's difficult to find good community | Very very informative | Work well | Very useful almost 100% accurate | Very good | Good idea *but need to spices what for used* | A great help in identifying my cactus 🌵 | The app is good though sometimes it gives me two different names of the same plant. How is that ? | Best experience. Gives you the probable findings of your photos arranged by probability. Would have been even better if it had standard photos of every species. | Good | Very quick and accurate response with this app. | Great app. Works well | Excellent app | Should add translator | Did not identify anything | I guess I have an unidentifiable plant. Not even close to what's growing in my front yard. | Easy to use and great results | مفيد جدا للتعرف علي الأسماء العلميه للنباتات | Very Helpful! | The OG app for plant identification. Works great, free, made by scientists to help you do some science, not by me-too devs to cram ads down your throat. What else do you need? | This is hands down the best app ID app I've used and recommend it religiously. It's free, no ads, and makes me want to pay for it! | Very educational it allows me to choose what I feel is the correct plant | i trying | So nice | Unsubscribe pls | Worked everytime for me and is sooooo useful. i learn to know plants that I never before knew the names and history of. | Awesome experience the app users guided me in right direction -i always wanted to know more about trees especially identity and uses and I have been taught both. By no means am I an expert but I am smarter about trees-allot | One the the best app I have ever use to Identify plants, it's fast to give results. | It has been a very vital key to my heath it a very good app | So helpful | Very good. Love the persentige showed | Super app ☺️ | Love this app it's helped me so many times easy to use and free | . It's the best | This app is very good, I had a very good experience with it for verification of medicinal plants. Now make it even more correct. | Quite good . | very good app. | Very useful app for plants lovers. I recommend it without a piece of doubt. | Very convenientn useful | Excellent | Nice app | Exceptionallly optimum","{""1"":7965,""2"":1867,""3"":6441,""4"":23934,""5"":195554}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","PlantNet","8292161998699316373","contact@plantnet-project.org","https://plantnet.org/",,"https://api.plantnet.org/views/terms_of_use","8292161998699316373","Education","EDUCATION","[{""name"":""Education"",""id"":""EDUCATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6p_UoXPjovHWARuVaOilwZzjIOzqltetjYkE9eQ9L9ZhgBb2Fbbl8LkVCf-k64k8Fw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KPSolZnKlLpty5nQunOJWi5OGlg2Wp2Qx6SbpX3208TNpfnqvesDLvc-fNTGyue80g","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SynFhkxTfmYbxMhUuDxrTU9njyfV2kJO5-Hz4VwdDxzMSy--YRaJHBmyr3KtnmsxeVQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3nPYFZqafpRP_zBq0_vHe2lYBEarZ-qPn7pll4QOnEjg56vYlHhacTT8S3SJbm2vAzo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ytsFgixT-m-amPw64SoVgQDvnQ1mVC0bhM6grnyHMk4ym_1K7W6IBiGbzmL0GSYH23s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DuIMwGhzCTG6vakEqq_LCfxPrT_-U_rII_fZjFfU_PK4qa52DJfO4NVrrShPRCSvgSZD"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y5y9f3FDiYKtxPQjMfolt9EhXEBHCebYaa9q784RbMOG8OQNdSzs4Xc0bQoTJuOb_DY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d7cqdFUp5Vdf9_fazAaW0kxI6Lb4xz84vChPjojyV7eM60TCo_afoBSOUcTobVzF9fA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y0PU2NEKcmcEmTlbmzT9aORAmPu-bEK3w9gDIQpL0V6r7RfBVQDa9dHdgRvFvhCSfw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uqPd0FHagloDKFnsfMP6bJ97jBavQDgNtvKvdlQeeV-pqTpMXbXZiq2l_yZR8gkEdoez"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/YAIZS3B0Ho3MIHev1W3aLBUNhNEaUkJSrG5wHs3HorJEJKN-tN38as-tmhHlOaGV-WI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dhqgeemUUOHa37Euf02WgsfnFRD9rdp5zgjPSQsP0hSLEYXGNjp4h0AcJXPCKaQfbLE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4dIzzAddkyahTMvxRIckBHfhp_tIpJl3rTCDdMrf1ECpYxtzSNkbuQOk5AVqJcXq33w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5DdFSDejQOoe8XDFmZdSrJNMW9dfQBnOxu0PSyQ9mQWDrIhWuQwGGEZ0EMpkVouSSvtW""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jan 21, 2014",1710780972000,"3.17.6","- Added Belarusian and Occitan languages.<br>- Fixed critical fullscreen image bug.<br>- Implemented coarse geolocation for Android&#39;s flora selection.<br>- Enhanced group functionality.<br>- Added species-related features and fixes.","[""I love the simplicity of being able to take a photo to check the plant name.

Never use this app | Support is not answering, multiple payment issues Tried again a year after: No more payment issues but support still sucks and service is awful. Not recommended | Nice | Helpless at our area always not available | Very bad service. Changed delivery time by 30 minutes and till now no courier assigned. If you have option select anynother delivery app. Don't ever use Bolt. | Don't deliver where I stay | Completely trash delivery, my pizza come destroyed | Useless support framework | Be very careful. There's an ongoing scheme where the person that delivers is not the one shown in the app. It's a major safety issue that Bolt chooses to ignore. Do you really want to be opening your house door to someone you can't trace? | What's the flippen point of this apps no one dilver in my area like wth all these apps are just useless | Better service | Mu adress suddenly got baned ore something | Bots control support service, so they offer 1 eur compensation on nearly hour late cold order that I've tried to cancel for half an hour. Don't use this app if you have other options. | Very bad ap I lost money and I didn't get order or money | Zero service | Support is dumb, if you get the wrong order they don't refund your money | Terrible support experience. Really avoid as much as possible! They don't assume their mistakes and avoid as much as possible to give the money back. Real shame... | Bad service. No delivery and near zero communication with thr customers. | The app manipulates one into thinking that the order has been prepared though they have barely informed the restaurant.its honestly the worst food delivery app so far in kenya | Food comes late. Support is useless | Delivered less food then ordered. And refused to deliver food that was missing. | I can't access my account? All the time, ya'll say verification code sent but I don't get any code why? | Very slow start | Totálne neschopná podpora, papagáje ktoré len dookola opakujú to isté a nie sú schopní sa zamyslieť nad kompromisom ak vám nevyhovuje ich riešenie ktoré samozrejme nie je dostatočné. Zaplatila som za položky ktoré mi nikdy neboli doručené a nikdy som za nich nedostala kompenzáciu. Sťažovať sa na podporu tiež nie je kde, keď od nich pýtate nejaký kontakt na nadriadeného/kompetentného, tak vám odpovedia že žiadny taký kontakt neexistuje. Bez vyriešenia reklamácie sami ukončili chat v Bolt aplikaci | At this point, this app is an online scam: - no compensation for missing products or any other issues, they send you to the place you ordered the food from, which is illegal - prices are far higher than the competition - bolt market products are very old and almost expired, which is illegal - delivery times far in excess of those indicated - couriers are treated very badly and they're almost never available for orders - none of the issues above are present when dealing with competing apps | Odvratno loša i pohlepna kompanije Nabijanje cijena u nebo , nikakav support a o vozacima da nepricam | Asistenta oferita în cazul comenzilor greșite era bunicica. Acum a devenit foarte proasta. Nu răspund la mesaje, nu returnează banii pentru produsele nelivrate! | I really like this app! It's really worth it. I rate it 5 stars because I love it. The over all service & delivery service are fantastic. Highly recommended from my side 10/10. | Even more fees!! Fees fees fees! Small order fee!! Discounts (but only after an expensive order!). Service fee! Some other nonsense fee! | A very legit one and fast delivery....Thanks Bolt food🫶 | Kai trūksta prekių užsakyme, grąžina tik suma už maistą, tai jeigu vistiek nori trūkstami maisto vėl mokėti service fee, delivery fee, small order fee, supportas visiškai nepadeda ties tuom ir jų vidinėse taisyklese neduodamas jokia papildomą kompensaciją. Sistema tokia kad vistiek klientas pralosia, rekomenduoju filmuoti kada atsiemate savo užsakymą, nes jeigu kažko nebus - apipis. | Have been trying to open this app and is just Soo annoying that wouldn't open | Too expensive, they charged me 7.4e for a ""small order"" | O panarama de app.. Merge sa platesti doar cu cardul si pe langa asta angajati toti boschetarii nespalati sa livreze, care fac comenzile terci ca sa nu mai zic ca nu raspundeti in timp real pe chat. Niste jigodii | S-a deselectat adresa de acasa cand am comandat si s-a introdus o adresa random. Am sesizat in secunda 2 si am incercat sa iau legatura cu ei, insa a durat extrem de mult sa ma puna in legatura cu un operator, timp in care comanda deja fusese atribuita unui curier. Am reusit sa iau legatura cu livratorul insa nici ei nu au nicio putere im aceste situatii, si a trebuit sa anuleze ei preluarea. Operatorul s-a spalat pe maini si mi-a zis ""sa folosesc responsabil app"" | Nice app, but your support is so bad. That AI bot lying he will solve the problem and then doing nothing.. | Hope I could leave a nice review of 0 stars. Now explaining all the situation so hopefully people will not use bolt food as it is a disgrace for Lithuanians. For 26e order I paid 126e??? No resolve will be hi to police. To get scammed that bad by the driver. My order was 26euro. i gave him 100e and he say he give change to bolt balance (70e) means a tip of 4e. And I got scammed - driver put food amount as not paid to my bolt food acc. And on the top of that support no help me in 24h? Support?! | If the restaurant doesn't deliver your food after you've already paid for it, support will do nothing. | Good apps | FURA BANI DE PE CARD NU COMANDATI!!!!!! | Pridėjo random mokesčių | Muitos problemas | 90% of couriers dont even read instructions, half of the time they cant even call me because it doesnt work | Very poor customer service, you need to wait a lot to hear back from them. Besides this couriers randomly bail out on you and this adds significant waiting time(one time I have had 3 different couriers bail out for one single order which was supposed to take 20 minutes) | Generally very good , courier and support, used to use Glovo too many issues Bolt more professional | Very bad, one star is too much | Wrong language in commercial. Russian or something. Why? In Estonia? Bad commercial = bad app. | Horrible service | used to deliver in my area and boom not any more | Mi s-a livrat mancare stricata si pur si simplu au pastrat restaurantul listat. Nu ke pasa deloc de ce primim. Raspuns? Va oferim crditBolt.. nici macar banii inapoi. Nu mai zic ca am ramas nemamcati. 0 customer care.. doar firma de livrare oreice gatit de orice bucatarie improvizata. | i don't like it the food is super cold | Worst app ever.. They did not deliver my order | The best ordering app so far, the couriers are polite and professional, and the delivery is quick. 10/10 | Total disapointment! My order not delivered and my money not refunded!Totally Scam! | Very very very poor experience with the app they don't deliver everywhere, even in town. You guys should just shut the app down. | They cancelled my order and refused to refund me . Bolt food kindly refund me | I used to like this app, and being a person that is working in the day, i count on it to get my dinner, but lately and on many occasions the delivery service has become so bad and it is actually affecting the quality of the food, right now i ordered over an hour ago , the food is ready since 45 mins and still no courier to pick my order, definitely the food will arrive spoilt and might even make me sick. I will just uninstall it, and I hope no one install it, because he will end up disappointed | Great | Fake discounts and false advertising. Found at least several restaurants where is written ""an offer"" with -30% where in reality the price in the app is over 30% higher than in the place itself. This is unacceptable. | Good | Off the hook ✨️ | They take the money and never deliver . Customer service do not care ,,, very bad app | Kaut kāds bardaks lietotne. Atļauj strādāt restorāniem, kuri nepieņem pasūtījumus un tad cenšas izdomāt iemeslus, kāpēc nepieņēma pasūtījumu, bet tajā pašā laika nekas nemainās restorāna lapā | Neseriozitate!!! | Кусок *****, чтобы заказать бургер верификация по паспорту. Нет уж, спасибо, заказывайте сами. | After google deleting my 1st review, I understand now why most apps have good reviews. Anyway, here's why it's 1 star (and it would be zero stars if it was possible). I had 2 coupons, after using the 1st coupon, Bolt Food removed the 2nd coupon. I just uninstalled the app afterwards lol. Thanks for the 1st cheap meal but I'm not wasting 1 more cent if you are going to behave like that. | This app is so cool | App is decent but there is no way to select a specific tip. Please change that | Hrozná podpora. V prípade problému s objednávkou nie sú schopní vyriešit problém. Bola mi doručená nekompletná objednávka. Podpora mi zdelila, že si to mám vyriešit s reštauráciou. | Very poor service, takes forever to find courriers and even longer to deliver!! | This service has the worst customer service of all. Been a loyal customer since 2015 when they came into the Latvian market as taxify, stayed loyal when yandex was pushing prices down, refused to use wolt when they started food. Today I'm deleting the app because they can't get any anything done right: driver scams you - it's your problem, the courier can't find you - too bad for you, want to delete just one part of their business - too bad cause all of them are gone. Praying for uber to come! | Terrible experience. Will never use it again. Anti customer approach. | Extremely Poor service! They do not follow up on orders! You can wait 3 hrs for a 30 min order. | Very bad I am deleting the App and wil make sure I don't use it ever again | Cheap good food | Not available in Stellenberg Road | This is for the app in Lithuania. Works well enouth. But they are trying to hide their delivery fees in food costs. Kebab costs 6eur in place? It costs 8 via app. But hey, free delivery... | tasty | Terrible customer support, always send AI generated replies and don't even refund you properly. If you want to speak to a human being, you have to go to very far lengths to do so. | I have ordered food from many apps but I have found this Bolt app to be the dirtiest. There is a good thing about it. They give discounts. But sometimes they ask for their ID card and selfie. What does this mean? This is our privacy. ever foody and wolt These two companies never asked about our privacy, it is our choice. Whether we order by cash or online, it does not matter whether we order online only, it is our choice. | The support | Ordered Sushi, and after ine hour of waiting I've got message, cos my order was just cancelled, because Bolt courier, ""accidentally took wrong order, and left restaurant "" no sorry, no apology, nothing from. BOLT SIDE. SIMPLY reorder if you still hungry. Ridiculous!!!!! | Fraudulent practices. Drivers will eat your food but claim they delivered it. | Customer care is non-existent. They have 0 softskills and cate for customers. | GPS in Malta does not work | Awful | Part of the meal was delivered and they didnt do anything because the ingridients were not written on the restraunt menu, like they cant use the internet to search what that dish consist of, awful customer service overall | The worst customer support, they have. And the service is getting pretty worse each day. | Terrible. App has bugs when you try to contact support. Food delivery is extremely delayed. Get glovo instead | Dupa 3 ore de cand am dat o comanda cu maxim 40 min timp de livrare, aceasta a foat anulata fara posibilitatea de a vorbi cu un operator uman. | it has no functionality to: star/favorite places you want to try it has no option to ""block""/remove places from the view it has no option to report vendors (for inflated prices compared to the vendor website) | It literally became a scam. Courrier can do anything, even outright not deliver your order at all, and support will do nothing about it. | It has been over 2 years and still your app does not cover our area. Waist of time | This app is full of unserious set of people selling nonsense do not download!!! Find the restaurant on Google map and order or go there to avoid any inconveniences.thanks | Vis bija labi līdz šodienai. Pārdomāju pasūtījuma saturu. Uzrakstu uz atbalstu. Paradās, ka atcels pasūtījums. O super! Saprotu, ka varu pa jaunu salikt ēdienus. Salieku! Atnāca man divi pasūtījumi. Pilnīgi neur neparadījās, ka ir divi paralēli pasūtījumi. Tikai kad piegādāja, tad sarakstā pasūtījumi paradās šie divi pasūtījumi. Izstradājas savu aplikāciju normālāk. | Low as f payment for courier. 1 tip from client per month like 2-5 zl. | Best ordering app so far | When you need help nobody responds, also they raised the delivery fees a lot and now it's just not worth it anymore unless you order food for 2+ people and split the bill. Better to use Tazz or Glovo or any other app | Very good | App works as expected, just some feature choices are a bit wierd, for example you have to deside if you want to leave a tip when ordering, so if the currier was rude or was making stops along the way with your order, well you already tipped for it :) or the other way around if you got nice service but did not tip in advance, well now you can't. I guess its a saving on processing fees to make us pay with one payment. | Scammers. Stole my money and didn't even receive any food. I never received my money or food. They still got the nerve to tell me they are compensating the kitchen. Scammers. Just wait for it. Cause I'd surely sue you guys. | Used to be pretty alright until they took away the ability to pay with cash. Now that they don't have that edge over Wolt anymore, I'll likely be uninstalling and using Wolt a lot more. Being able to pay in cash was the only reason I was willing to pay slightly overpriced prices on this app. They also keep trying to offer me discounts that I can't use because guess what? I'd want to pay in cash. Good job on making sure your app was no longer unique amongst your competitors. | Rubbish | Worst experience ever, speaking with support is same as speaking to the wall, got damaged order after 1h (food was cold af) at that point it was not eatable, and they offered 4e when i bought out 25e order. Worst part is thar courier was delivering 3 orders at once an my order was the last. Restoran i bought from had increased delivery fee to ensure that curier will deliver it faster amd still i chrcked map and saw that it was taking my food for a drive for 1h when they forced me to pay extra | The app works well for the most part, but it adds significant markups. I found products that are half the price on the manufacturer's website compared to the app. And in the physical store, they are about 2/3 of the price displayed on the app. It seems excessive, a per-order fee would be preferable instead of inflating prices, a rather cunning concept. | The support has gotten worse, agents frequently lie and gaslight even if the order is clearly wrong or severly delayed. | Awful service. And please stop with misleading delivery promos , and hidden service fees. | Service quality is not relevant to the service provider. Better off with alternatives. | Péssima assistência. Pedido muito atrasado, e só 2h depois é que me permitiram cancelar. | After asking them to educate their employees in basic comunication and behavioral skills (some guy ring for no reason on my bell and blew me off with ""no abla"" after i asked if i can help him with something and walked off...) i got WARNED not to use ""THOSE words"" (Implicating that i was racist after saying ""teach them to read last names on the bells, if they know only those *wormy* letters..."") That trigered woke system i guess...would recomend 11/10 if you are a borred lawyer 🙂 | Support dont help you at all. I order burger king at 10:00 at night and i get after a wile a message from my delivery guy telling me go get your food cuz i will not delivery. Now i did not know who the f is this paki. Now support refunded me after 10 hours cuz they do not work at all and that was it no credid no sorry no nothing just a refund and now im waiting for the money to come in. Do not support the useless bolt workers. I hope they shut down soon and fire all of them every last one | high fees, no option to cancel order or change address, suport is slow | Great. Would appreciate to leave a tip after the delivery. | The app is good and the experiance with the customer service is nice. I wish if they can allow me to share order details with other app users in WhatsApp. Like sharing where the riders are with the people I ordered together with. This will be great feature should the driver arrive and I was busy to pick it, then it could be collected by the person I shared riders details and location with. | Idk | Excellent !! | Useless | For the older version | Good service i order food and get in next 15 mins the expected time was likw 25 mins so give 5 star | I ordered food for my kids at 7pm at 9pm food not delivered, what a joke ! What pains me no way to cancel this order ,the kids have gone to sleep. Yam fried 2 hours ago waiting for biker to pick up, hmmm | Alfred bot... | Привезли лише частину замовлення, кошти не повернули | Customer support form is so hidden..... | The comments are very good and I think it's a good app for food and stuff | Awful reliability, Zero customer service. | Very terrible app.Communication is completely messed up. | Please make courier search and food preparing in parallel | Bolt Food Doesn't Deliver In Braamfischer | Useless and complicated | I had an incident and the customer service guy sent 2 copy pasted messages and proceeded to ignore me, the issue was not solved and I had to pay a taxi to get the food mylsef 👍 on a delivery app, truly amazing | Garbage app, its surprising if something ever works | Amazing | Zero customer support | never estimates delivery time properly, always from 20 to 40 more minutes than expected | Neimanoma atsaukti uzsakymo. | Completely useless app doesn't work don't waste your time downloading this app | Not recommended ! If courier don't bring delivery no refund will be returned. And there are couriers that just keep the delivery. So potentially be ready to loose your money with this app | They show me purposely restaurant that is not near me so I pay delivery fees. | You order food from somewhere and IF there is a courier who's willing to bring you the food then you are lucky if not you have to personally go and pick up the food from where you ordered. My food was ready for 20 minutes and then I got fed up waiting and went to get the food myself or else I would have stayed hungry on Valentine's day. If it was someone else they would have rated the restaurant 1 star instead of the service of this app. I even contacted support and nothing what else can I do? | delivery was 2.5 hours late. due shortage of couriers. what a joke of an app. | Terrible delivery, garbage | Scheduled an order, and it got canceled by the system. It also was overdue by some time when it was cancelled. The support did not help in any way. | Poor service | The food arrives cold 90% of the time. Once the currier was going on his own business for 40 mins and when I asked to cancel the delivery, I was told that it's the only time this can be done. Overall nobody considers the warmth of your food, the quality or your overall experience (the readtaurants are doing their best in most of the cases from my experience). Overall service is among the worst ones I've seen in EU | Customer support isnt helpful. I asked why wasnt a restaurant available and the response was answering a question i didnt even ask. | App doesn't work, trying to reach support team is impossible | Very bad client service | food app with a good variety of restaurants and options. | app just says they don't deliver to all of the addresses I choose, even areas that worked before | Edit: 24/10/2023, they're refusing to give me a refund, when I stated I had an allergy and an allergen was in my food. Uninstalling. Edit (12/02/2024) gave them the benefit of the doubt around 1 month ago. Same situation. Tomato allergy ignored today, after ordering multiple times weekly, they say I have a history of restaurants ignoring my notes about tomato allergy so I WAS THE ONE GETTING PUNISHED FOR IT, I'm not getting refunded. I ordered multiple times,just today I had a problem. AVOID APP | Not functioning properly especially the point u have to input ur number and country | Is not good to not have the option to cancel a order from the app. | Un jeg ordinar de companie, comenzi peste comenzi respinse, aplicatie abia functionala si lipsa crasa de asistenta pentru orice. O sa va fac reclama peste tot, sunteti niste infecti. | Your guys take long to deliver food. Very unreliable | No issues | Search doesn't work correctly | Kurjeriai tris kartus iš eilės nesugebėjo sekti ""Pastabų"" skiltyje nurodytų itin svarbių žingsnių. Už kurjerio paslaugas šiandien sumokėjome 5€ ir jis net neperskaitė pastabų skilties, dėl to nukentėjo mano sveikata. Parašius bolt food pagalbai, nebuvo skirta netgi pristatymo (5€) kompensacija, tiesiog gavome kažkokius abstrakčius atsiprašymus. Praeitą kartą kurjeris išvis buvo visiškai girtas, agresyvus, mėtėsi keiksmažodžiais. Kuo toliau, tuo bolt food pagalbai mažiau rūpi. Graudu | Orders take hours to be delivered. Some orders get cancelled due to such delays | Worst delivery....They will eat your order | bad | Poor customer support if anything goes wrong with your order. They just ""apologise"" via an automated message. | I was disaponted from this app last week i order my meal from vecchia napoli sky park and when i receved my food i payed in fool amount of money the courior gave me the food.. when i go on the app again on the app they wrote that i pay only 11€ from 31€ ....20€ balance stupid thing...if commen sens thing if idont have the full amount of money he dident gave me the food? if he loose it why he put belance on my acc No served at all | Apgailetina. Ivede DI i aptarnavima, dabar neimanoma susikalbeti. Never use again. | Please allow to name payments cards | Filthy riders and unprofessional support. Exactly the same as their unreliable and criminal taxi service. | Привезли частично испорченный заказ (залит минералкой), возмещать стоимость порченного отказались Ужасная работа с клиентами, как будто клиент с парой сотен заказов решил внезапно их обмануть. Не рекомендую, полно альтернатив. | Propmt was sent, money was deducted from my mpesa,but the order did not reflect in my app. No refund has been made and it's been more than 24hrs now | Here I am again to complain. The app took my money, the order was never processed, and when I'm trying to open a support request the app loads ad infinitum. This is so laughably bad, Jesus Christ | 👍. | Slow delivery noone working | The support is very bad They don't reply on your chat The application doesn't include any number for support The delivers are thieves | Ordered food for delivery, gave me a delivery time which kept getting pushed back, when I contacted the app they insisted it was a self pick up order even though nothing was selected and restaurant indicated delivery times within this time frame. Was told thank you for your understanding 😆 jokers | Got cold food, late delivery. Delivery guy was walking around the building for 10 minutes while carrying my food in a paper bag. It's winter outside. Bolt support offered 1,50 euro compensation. Like a spit in the face. No thanks, I am going to Wolt. | La support au aproximativ un om, care doarme | I really wish that I could tip the delivery guy after he arrives, because I might tip if he/she was fast and some people really doing a great job | Terrible experience. The order never arrived and the support team said it's my fault and i should have been more carefull. Uninstalled | Kindly make order review option available so we can read before buying..some vendors don't deserve to be on this app | Absolute trash. You are paying for delivery+ you are paying service fee+ Prices are higher than in restaurants+ Small order fee etc. | I don't know why bolt food app is misbehaving...I have been requesting for a code to sign in for the past week...till date no code is given when I put in my number...I guess I have to stop using it | Coold food every order | Just one nitpick: the tipping option should appear AFTER the delivery, not before | The food almost always comes cold, half of the times some food is missing that they dont even refund because I do not have photos of the missing food. The customer cannot contact them | Thanks to Bolt the food prices in restaurants are higher than they would normally be. The pricing and all the small fees look like a scam. 0eur delivery from McDonalds cost me 10eur more than buying from McDonalds directly. | I'm pretty happy with their groceries. Slightly expensive, but they deliver what you buy and quality is fine. | Unreliable stupid time wasting app | I'm surprised how a rider can send your food away after been unable to reach you because you've made payment already . And support won't respond to your complaint. | Pentru București evitați aceasta aplicație. Servicii de livrare execrabile: mancare rece, timpi de livrare ce cresc progresiv. Sesizările sunt inutile. | Postali su užasni, chat za podršku ne radi samo se bot Alfred javlja, 40 minuta se nije dostavljač mogao pronaći. Brišem aplikaciju koristit ću Wolt i Glovo rađe. | Keeps on saying nothing in my area but yet on the other apps I do have restaurants close | Očaj. Korisnička podrška je robot i ne služi ničem. Predstave vrijeme dostave na svakom restoranu i platiš da dostave u to vrijeme i ekipa redovno nema dostavljača pa se mora čekati minimalno sat vremena za dostavu, ali najčešće oko sat i pol do dva sata. Najgora aplikacija za dostavu hrane ikada. Teška sramota | They don't start finding couriers till the food is already done and ready for pick up. The process of finding a courier takes 40+ minutes and you end up with cold food. | Easy to use. A favorite restaurants section would be cool to add. | Worst customer support ever invented in history | Does not take accountability. Delivered a random half of an order and only refunded half the order to our ""Bolt"" balance and not the original payment method. Could have smoothed it over by at least giving some coupons or something. Now half the people are starving for an extra hour. And we supposedly got our money's worth. Bad practices. Avoid and use competitor when possible. | It works but the filtering it trash. It shows a ton of pointless stores not related to food.

Iys the cheapest option here in Prague and there are always some nice offers. Unfortunately it just happens to often that one is not able to get a delivery due to too high demand - whereas other apps are always available."",""The application is quite OK with a user interface you would expect and might be used to. It works just fine and contrary to some other similar apps doesn't lie about prices and delivery fees. Its search function is very limited and basically useless unless you know the exact name of the venue you are searching for. It has the best-in-class order tracking that actually works. The service itself is the fastest and cheapest at my location (Prague, Czech Rep.) and is very reliable. Overall this is the best food delivery service available in the city ...as long as everything goes as expected. Once something goes wrong you are screwed. There is no support whatsoever. It is even stated in their terms and conditions that they are only an online market and that they only care about your money. No guarantees, no communication. I once tried to complain about my order being delivered incomplete and they never even responded. It seems to be a fire-and-forget autonomous system without any supervision and support. Update: The last time I needed to contact the support, it actually worked and I was instantly refunded 100% of the order price."",""The app is overall okay even though the tracking sometimes is weird. But that's the only reason they get 2 stars and not one. The customer service for bolt food is absolutely horrible. Easily one of the worst i have ever seen.

I got a completely different product from what they show on their app and then they just said, yeah that's how it looks like. My advice is avoid bolt food."",""It provides great and amazing discounts which stores conveniently choose to not participate so you can't order and take advantage of the great experience this is app is trying to achieve!

Teraz załóżmy że jestem w sklepie i co mam zrobić? Będę zostawiał rzeczy przy kasie i wychodził. Jak wy mi, tak ja wam. I te zgody to już naprawdę przesada.

Wrocław dworzec główny. | Spamuje SMSami | Otrzymuję głupawe smsy po aktualizacji aplikacji, na które nie wyraziłam zgody. Muszę zainstalować appkę ponownie, żeby usunąć to konto, bo to jakiś żart. | There is no possibility to avoid SMS spam (promotions, comparisons to competition). Had to delete account to do so. Please, add option to prevent SMS/notification spam. Currently, if you register, you are forced to receive spam. | Shakomat nie działa.

Brak możliwości wyłączenia wibracji przy korzystaniu. | Sama apka spoko, ale to długie ładowanie i brak cache jest tragiczne. Biedronka obok mnie jest w środku bloku gdzie nie ma zasięgu i jak zapomnę co miałem za kupony to musiałbym wyjść ze sklepu żeby spojrzeć (albo zrobić wcześniej screenshoty, tak, robię tak żeby się upewnić że dobry produkt biorę z półki).

All you can do delete the account it's the best way to solve all the bugs . But now I don't have account I just lost it and still continue receive it's spam. Fix - mark those sms as spam | Ceny nie zgadzaja sie z tymi przy kasach, nie stabilna, nie dziala czytnik do sprawdzania cen | Am I completely blind or there's no way for adding products to the shopping list from the main application screen? | Barcode recognition not work everytime and fast enough. Previous app did it with a speed of light. IMO some OCR problem. Lower rate also because of annoying SMS SPAM 😑 | Po aktualizacji aplikacji wymuszają zgodę na spam SMSowy, z którego nie da się wypisać bez rezygnacji z konta. Więc zrezygnowałem z konta. | brakuje wyszukiwania produktów po nazwie | Eee, stonka, nie przychodzi mi sms potrzebny do zalogowania się. | After capturing your phone number it sends you daily SMS marketing/ads without option to unsubscribe. | Nowa wersja aplikacji działa znacznie lepiej i do tego jest dark mode. Oby tak dalej! | Przestańcie wysyłać mi te smsy, nikogo to nie obchodzi (jestem za lidlem) Edit po odp: Pytanie jak to pozniej wyłączyc? | Not possible to regist without giving consent to send me commercial sms and mail | Nachalne smsy, brak możliwości rezygnacji z smsów rekalmowych bez kasowania konta. Aplikacja i tak nie działa stabilnie. Poza tym mają aplikacje i wysyłają smsy zamiast powiadomień przez Aplikację. Brak możliwości rezygnacji z reklam sms to jakiś skandal sam w sobie.

Dziękuję! | O wiele poprawił się design i UI aplikacji działa płynnie tym razem nie zmusza cię do czekania przez pół minuty na ładowanie i w końcu nie zmusza mnie do ciągłego odpalania lokalizacji | Bardzo podoba mi się ostatni update! | Unable to even register. Getting some bogus error message about unusual traffic | Bardzo źle działająca aplikacja. Wolno się ładuje. Shakeomaty generują promocje na wyprzedane produkty albo zniżki po 4%. Nie da się wyłączyć wibracji. Gdyby nie fakt że niektóre promocje wymagają aplikacji nigdy bym nie zainstalował. | Po aktualizacji UI wygląda jeszcze gorzej. Wciąż są problemy z działaniem - aplikacja sama się zamyka, zawiesza, ładowanie zajmuje wieki. Nie da się wyłączyć wibracji. Brawo, tylko chlewionka potrafi przenieść standard sklepowy na aplikację. | Nowa aplikacja działa stanowczo szybciej i sprawniej od poprzedniej - wielki plus za poprawę. Mam tylko problem z językiem aplikacji, pomimo wybrania polskiego, aplikacja dalej jest po angielsku... | Jestem zainteresowany i zadowolony | Po aktualizacji nie ma możliwości korzystania bez wyrażenia zgody na wysyłanie reklam. Byłem stałym użytkownikiem i poleciłem apke wielu osobom. Teraz z chęcią ją usunę każdemu komu pomogłem zainstalować. Mogliście chociaż pozwolić na wyświetlanie karty biedronki do tego raczej zgód marketingowych nikt nie wymaga... Dno dna... Ceny w sklepie są bardzo mylące kiedyś mogłem skorzystać ze skanera z aplikacji teraz już nie. Psujecie wszystko co tylko możliwe... | już wiele lepiej | po najnowszej aktualizacji ze zmiana interfejsu aplikacja działa nieporównywalnie lepiej. nie jestem pewien czy logowanie zostało w całości naprawione, czy działa wystarczająco skutecznie że już nie zauważam błędu z logowaniem gdzie trzeba było ubijać aplikacje i przełączać x razy tryb samolotowy. poprzednia wersja to solidne 1/5 które trwało od początku aplikacji praktycznie do teraz. nowa wersja ma bezużyteczny skaner, który nie czyta 8/10x. lista zakupów dno-ręczne wpisywanie nazw i brak cen. | New version is much better than the old one! | Guys you are amazing. The app now is perfect. Super fast with great design | Dlaczego nie ma oczywistej opcji dodawania produktów do listy zakupów z zakładki oferty (tylko dla ciebie, Biedronkowe oszczędności itd.)? | Nie wiem kto wam napisał tą nową aplikację ale w porównaniu z starą to jest jak niebo i ziemia. Wcześniej musiałem czekać 50 sekund żeby się załadowała, teraz otwiera się jak każda inna. Jest też o wiele bardziej responsywna i w mojej opinii ładniejsza. | wreszcie po aktualizacji aplikacja szybko się włącza, nie wyrzuca błędów z połączeniem i gazetki szybko się ładują szkoda tylko przycisku do wstrząsania shakematem (dziwnie jest faktycznie wstrząsać telefonem, nie chcę tego robić regularnie) i przydałoby się usprawnić nawigację po gazetkach (przycisk przewijania do następnej strony i suwak do szybkiego przeskakiwania wielu stron) | Nowa wersja aplikacji jest dużo lepsza od poprzedniej | Nowa wersja wymaga ode mnie zgody na telefony marketingowe. Ocena 0 & uninstall | Edit: dobra robota - nowa wersja aplikacji zdaje się rozwiązywać większość niedociągnięć, których dotyczyła moja poprzednia ocena. | Samsung Note 10+ (SM-N975F): ""Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network."" Not possible to pass registration step. | I can not even create an account. So, it does not work at all. | Nowa aplikacja niestety mnie co 2 dni wylogowywuje, a ponowne logowanie związane jest z wprowadzaniem numeru telefonu i przepisywaniu kodu otrzymanego przez sms. Bardzo uciążliwe i denerwujące to jest niestety | New version is much better than old one | Dodali czarny motyw więc ja zmieniam na 5 gwiazdek :) Dzięki Biedronka! | Hard to keep me authorised, even if i checked ""keep me logged in""??? | Nowa aplikacja to dno, w starej można było wejść we wszystkie promocje dla ciebie zrobić screen i mieć na telefonie teraz to porażka. | Upd.: Uninstalled the new version and rollback to the old. Thanks. Prev.: After the app update it forces to opt in to receive spam to my phone number or sms. There is no option to opt out. I don't want receive promotions to my phone number. | Updated version is very fast and smooth | Lubię Pani Bedrę | Zapisywanie się na zalewanie spamem przez sms/email w zamian za minimalne promocje które można wytrząsnąć z shakeomatu? Nie dziękuję, wywalcie to kompletnie bo nie ma opcji że ludzie będą chcieli się na to zapisywać | Caly czas dostaje informacje, ze nie moge sie zarejstrowac, bo aplikacja wykryla podejrzany ruch sieciowy | Dark theme is great in new version, but viewer of leaflets is downgraded, no more possible to fast scroll to certain page from preview mode, you have to scroll it one by one... it is not convinient=\ | The app logs out frequently | Coś strasznego... | It used to work great, slow at some point, but pretty stable - since upgrade to new version (2.0.1), it logs me out every two days, which is very annoying | Aplikacja cyklicznie się sama wylogowuje i wymaga ponownej autoryzacji sms'em. Problem nadal występuje i irytuje, a dostępnej aktualizacji, która skutecznie wyeliminuje problem - brak. | Nie można się zalogować do aplikacji pokazuje że moje konto zmigrowano do nowej aplikacji. Nie działa | Już działa. Cieszę się, że bardzo szybko się uruchamia w porównaniu do poprzedniej wersji 👍 | Zrobili jakieś zmiany w aplikacji i nie można się zalogować, straszny chłam | Pojawiła się nowa wersja aplikacja i w końcu mogłem zalogować się, jednak teraz po prostu nie działa. Nic się nie ładuje, cały czas jest komunikat i napotkanych przeszkodach. | Приложение просит авторизацию, но сайт не открывается. Перестало работать вообще... | New app doesnt work. | Nie działa od aktualizacji | The new version forces users to agree to receive newsletters and other commercial information too their phone numbers... Very nasty! | W końcu apka działa sprawnie, na co wszyscy czekali. Dziękujemy. | Finally, a functionable app. Good job, Biedronka. After all these years! | For me it got better, 5 starts to hard work | Nowa wersja aplikacji działa o wiele szybciej niż poprzednia, która była bardzo ciężka i powolna. | Super pomocna 😉 | Ok wróciło wszystko do normy. | Aplikacja bardzo niestabilna. Co 2 dni wylogowuje uzytkownika. | Fix it! | Codziennie a nawet wiele razy dziennie każe się logować, bez sensu Edit 15 stycznia: pomimo zapewnień nadal muszę się logować codziennie. | You've broken the auth, I have to login via SMS too often. It became better, first days after update I had to do it almost every app launch, but it's still annoying. | Aplikacja bardzo długo się wczytuje, częste problemy z połączeniem z serwerem. Od około miesiąca bardzo często pojawiają się różnego rodzaju błędy. | Programista chyba w trakcie kursu | Karta i aplikacja zarejestrowana na ten sam numer i co? I nie będzie zniżki, bo... Nie wiem dlaczego. Specjalnie wszystko komplikują. | Po zainstalowaniu nowej wersji nie jestem w stanie w ogóle się zalogować. Kompletna porażka. Update: Widzę że od dłuższego czasu macie ""małe techniczne problemy"" Strasznie długo wam idzie naprawienie tej aplikacji. | Bez sensu, ciągle mi wyskakuje, że mój numer przeniósł się do nowej aplikacji jakby dwie były, gdzie mój shakeomat ja się pytam xd | Cannot login. Asks to update, but no update available | Po aktualizacji wygląda brzydko, dalej się zacina i wiesza, problemy z zalogowaniem się ponownie. Nie da się zmienić języka. Edit. Działa, ładuje się bardzo szybko, tylko ilość shakeów w shakeomacie jest zdecydowanie zbyt duża. | Nie mogę się w ogóle zalogować do aplikacji, ponieważ wyskakuje komunikat by użyć najnowszej wersji, mimo zaktualizowania | Wylogowanie przed zakupami, a potem w trakcie. Skoro od paru dni informatycy pracują, to ja od paru dni częściej w Lidlu. | Slow, releases are broken. | App not working. Always says that I need to install latest app version. But I just reintall new version from goggle play | Not able to login. Everytime I login it's sending the same message that "" your account was moved to new Biedeonka app"". Is there a way to fix this? I have been struggling to login since last 2 weeks. | Keeps on requesting verification by phone number. The previous version was fine.... | Finally you did proper app with good design and nice optimisations. Please remove haptic vibrations, it's bad practice to enable it by default. Please place toggle in settings. Also found bug, when you have main screen with few elements, the scroll works only on this elements, the empty part is not scrollable. | I would fire PM because of this release. Previous was bad as well, btw. | Forgot to charge my phone and when i restarted it, the app told me to use only new version, reinstalled it and nothing, I opened a ticket and the reply was something like ""We have a bug...sorry"". Bravo people, next time make sure you test the update before you launch it. | Please add to your application a turn off option for vibration (imitation of a button pressing) for these screen ""buttons"": home, scanner, lists and more. | I don't thing i uave ever used an app so badly optimized as this is. It's unreliable, does not update offers when most of the stores are closed, leaflets section does not work properly and entire app freezes and refreshes every 3 seconds | After the most recent update I need to log on every single time I open the app. Useless at the checkout 🙁 | Nit able to login in Android mobile now(Pixel). After entering mobile number it shows error ""Your account was moved to new biedronka app"", but I don't see the new version in Play Store. It was very useful in the past especially for foriegners as it support English version. Now its really painful 😣 | Good | Aplikacji sie na produkcji nie testuje barany. | Wary nice 👌 Happy new years | maja dwa typy urządzen iphone Android nie ma mozliwosci uzywania konta zamiennie - aplikacja jest niezgodna między platformami. (nowa/stara wersja aplikacji) | Każde uruchomieniem aplikacji pyta o kod SMS pomimo zaznaczenia opcji 'zapamiętaj'. Odechciewa się używać.. | Edit: Aplikacja dalej działa jakby chciała a nie mogła, za każdym wejściem trzeba podać numer telefonu i kod co jest bardzo irytujące i zniechęca do używania aplikacji, szejkomat trzeba klikać z 20 razy zamiast 4 co także bardzo odrzuca. Aplikacja nie jest przejrzysta tak jak była przed aktualizacją. Update aplikacji na minus bardzo. | Not working properly | Requires extremely unreasonable marketing consent in order to even register an account. Uninstalled this garbage immediately. Read what you agree to and stay away. | Straszna autoryzacja. Niezdolny do logowania. | ta nowa aktualizacja aplikacji jest świetna, ale naprawdę denerwujące jest to, że każdego dnia raz po raz pyta o mój numer telefonu. Trzeba to naprawić. To bardzo denerwujące | Po aktualizacji pojawił się u mnie problem z logowaniem, więc od razu napisałam maila. Dzień później problem jest już rozwiązany, a aplikacja działa poprawnie (przynajmniej na razie) | Nowa wersja ponawia prosbe o logowanie na moja biedronka - codziennie, wyjątkowo uciążliwe. Dodatkowo przy próbie reinstalacji przez pobranie aplikacji na nowo, wyrzuca bład, ze kontobzl ostało przeniesione do nowej wersji. ""Płonący śmietnik"" nie oddaje dokładnie wątpliwej przyjemności korzystania z tej appki. | I like the new redesign, but I have to login manually with a SMS code pretty much every 2 days or so. I have your account for a long time and I'm pretty sure that the app isn't working as intended. | Porażka. Ściągnęłam nowa wersje aplikacji, wczoraj dziala bez zarzutu. Dzisiaj już nie działa, pokazuje że coś poszło nie tak i żeby spróbować później. Odinstalowałam ja, zrestartowałam telefon i zainstalowałam na nowo. Teraz pokazuje mi się ekran żeby się zalogować lub założyć konto. Próbowałam obie opcje, ale dalej nie działa. Jak klikam "" załóż konto"" pokazuje mi komunikat, że moje konto zostało przeniesione na nową wersje aplikacji i żeby ją używać, ale ja przecież taką właśnie mam. | Nowa aplikacja nie dziala,strona logowania nie ładuje się mimo dostępu do internetu | Po ostatniej aktualizacji przy każdym wejściu do aplikacji muszę się ponownie logować, ponowna instalacja nic nie dała. Proszę zróbcie coś z tym, bo jest to wnerwiające zwłaszcza jak na szybko w sklepie potrzebuje zeskanować kartę przy kasie... | Niezdatne do użycia, Spowolnione, Zamulone, szkoda nerwów. | Nowa aplikacja jest beznadziejna, co 2 dzień każe się rejestrować, zmiana języka nie działa. Dno | Po zalogowaniu na IOS, nie mogę się zalogować na androidzie bo dostaje komunikat o nieaktualnej wersji aplikacji (mimo że mam najnowszą), może byście pchali na proda w tym samym czasie na IOS i Android albo nie robili takich sztucznych ograniczeń? | Strasznie muli. Nawet nie da się wkleić numeru telefonu przy logowaniu. Najgorsza aplikacja jaką kiedykolwiek miałem Nawet scroll się zacina | Studenci juz lepsze apki robia na projekty na uczelnie, niz to cos | Oooo można jednak naprawić na poczekaniu, wersja 29 gru. już działa i nie miga ekran. | Od paru dni dostaje komunikat o błędzie i potrzebie aktualizacji aplikacji, w Google Play pokazuje że aplikacja jest najnowsza. Wyczyszczenie cache i storage nie pomogło, po reinstalacji dalej to samo, z tą zmianą że nawet nie mogę się zalogować żeby chociaż użyć kodu kreskowego karty. Apka tak czy siak jest zarypana i działa tak w 10% moich wizyt w markecie, nie ładuje ofert, nie ładuje map i źle wykrywa GPS. Masakra. | I can't use it myself because it doesn't accept Austrian numbers. I'm using a friends number but I constantly have to log in again, which is really annoying. | Najgorsza aplikacja na telefon jaką kiedykolwiek miałem nieprzyjemność używać. Ekran ciągle się odświeża, klawiatura pojawia się i znika z 5 razy na sekundę. Czasami nie da się zalogować, i reinstalacje nic nie dają. Najlepsze jest to że nie naprawili tych błędów od ponad roku. Chyba nikt nie pracuje już nad tym projektem. Aplikacja tworzona najprawdopodobniej za darmo przez stażystów bo nie wierzę, że ktoś za to zapłacił. | To jest niewiarygodne jak fatalnie ta aplikacja działa. | To się powinno nazywac: przepraszamy, cis poszło nie tak po naszej stronie. | Good luck using this app in Biedronka store with bad connection. Spent 5 min finding spot with better connection to check shakeomat. Even Lidl app work better while in store. | Kompletnie bezużyteczne, nie da się zalogować bo klawiatura pokazuje się i chowa 15 razy w ciągu sekundy | Najdłużej uruchomiająca się apka jaką znam. Jakieś pół minuty zanim cokolwiek można sprawdzić. Sprawdzone na dwóch telefonach. | Nie da się zalogować. Błąd o możliwości wysłania SMS z kodem potwierdzającym. | It takes 20 seconds just to get to the main screen. When you lose internet connection, you need to reload it and wait another 20 seconds. It's best to uninstall it completely because it does the opposite of helping you while getting your groceries :) | 70% czasu aplikacja nie działa. Edit: zrobiłem wszystkie 3, szkoda że po odinstalowaniu aplikacji wyświetla się błąd z wysyłaniem SMS i nie mogę się nawet zalogować oraz dalej wyrzuca do strony ładowania:// | Brak możliwości zarejestrowania, podczas rejestracji okno miga, klawiatura znika. | Nie działa | nie przypominam sobie żebym kiedykolwiek używał innej tak wolnej aplikacji, i ta ma pod tym względem naprawdę dużą przewagę... | Very good quality, wide range of products I highly recommend it 👍 | Aplikacja nie pozwala się zalogować, klawiatura otwiera się i zamyka kilka razy na sekundę... górna belka miga... Kto to kodził | App constantly closes if uses a VPN for privacy. It collects way too much user data from your location. Given how many polish companies get hacked because bad data practices like this app as. Recommend you don't use as Beidronka wants too much information from you then needed for the app to run. As a security professional highly advise you do not use this. | Jest okey ale czesto zacina lub wylogowywuje. Dodatkowo laduje sie zbyt dlugo | Sama idea fajna. Wykonanie dramatycznie słabe. Zmieńcie developera. Aplikacji nie da się używać normalnie: - dramatycznie wolna - grzeje telefon - wolno się ładuje - non-stop się odświeża = ekran miga jak na dyskotece + wraca do ekranu początkowego (spróbujcie tak oferty przgladac) UPDATE(po odpowiedzi na pierwszą część): jeżeli problemy z apką wynikają z używania antywirusa lub VPNa to ocena tej apki powinna być ujemna. Z innymi apkami sklepowymi takich problemów nie ma. | nie ma dark mode | długo się uruchamia i tragicznie działa ale za to jest prawie bezużyteczna | Its impossible to login. After I get the Sms it immediately displays the Something Aent wrong on our side error | Aplikacja zupełnie niezoptymalizowana - wystarczy mieć trochę gorszy telefon niż najnowszy flagowiec żeby się ścinała przy jakiejkolwiek próbie interakcji. Nawet samo uruchamianie apki wymaga cierpliwości. Dodatkowo od jakiegoś czasu wymagają, aby otwierać promocje w apce aby w ogóle była możliwość skorzystania z niej. Aplikacja dostaje ode mnie 1 gwiazdkę tylko dlatego, że nie mogę dać mniej. | Stabilność tragedia | Nie polecam! Pomimo wieku prób nie udało się nawet zalogować do aplikacji aby skorzystać z promki. | Gray screen, Doesn't work | Aplikacja zrobiona tragicznie, bardzo często w sklepie przy słabym zasięgu nie da się jej uruchomić | Takie bugi że ja nie mogę ,jak taka duża firma pozwala sobie na coś takiego. To nie zrobioną przez sofhouse a przez jakieś biuro rachunkowe | Nie da się zalogować i problem ten nie jest naprawiony już kilka miesięcy | Dramat | Nie dziala. Caly czas szary ekran. Odinstaluj/zainstaluj ponownie itp. nie pomaga | Not working | Useless app | Lagging when trying to login it or create new account. | Według mnie jedynym i ogromnym problemem aplikacji jest jej tempo Wszystko ładuje się BARDZO długo | Nie otwiera się. Sam szary ekran. Edit: próbowałem na 2 różnych wifi i transferze. Próbowałem reinstall 2 razy na różnych sieciach i nie używam żadnych proxy | Aplikacja jest tak wolna, że aż odechciewa się z niej korzystać. | Extremely sluggish, prone to crashes and server connection issues. | Od tygodni nie da się zalogować. | nie działa | Brawo. Zdobywacie pierwsze miejsce za najpowolniejszą apkę na telefonie. | aplikacja działa jak należy, polecam! 🥰 (dla osób ktore narzekają na długie otwarcie aplikacji, przypomnijcie sobie jak długo odpalał sie snake na nokii 3310)","{""1"":7316,""2"":1263,""3"":1596,""4"":2195,""5"":19422}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Biedronka","Biedronka","bok@biedronka.pl","https://biedronka.pl",,"https://moja.biedronka.pl/polityka-prywatnosci/","Biedronka","Shopping","SHOPPING","[{""name"":""Shopping"",""id"":""SHOPPING""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BqoVMNLyEheHv9lU9ygtpsET3R69S0n6q8_HblX4LNQjlHKqw4sDmcAdBwev-uKvoNBW","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y1bEkYTKNPQbU1wLzMiW8jug0XhxTx9EWttujw7anY8XHmjcQ5VJuV1IYpZ_j4PPts4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/O9eWvhnjTild0JcFGgmnvQtwamI4QX6ZWr4liZvboghL2U3Oz_4rott3ZD3kDC1hJw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bKUCUijm0vt1rlAWcZqqp1Z1rZHAMtzRJbw3dH-uGIJTP-mRmtisljy9qB06wobjRyo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R1LEDfFP3ewETc-vEmcUsf8Fkmaz-D1_-U1fK3jVBu4Q5T9p6vnZr7PHjIeazxPd-w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6S4sCsZ5RmvEML_uKKEjqSD5PjrfE_iL21e46lMW1GeyyZ8lB-oUO8_FQOUy6PoEbivy"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vHSdIV39A9kwO4t-d0GI_s89cuTtAV54c-MCbG7w427ZfEA_XJvTKjNfpZZQ9cZ98N4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KKWxmVTgGR7ohqRZOyBQ8CAoUe1PqNeJJIu9xQO3h0tH1AwUr0aZpgMbHYOV7fu5yaI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cUbWpVNDsOfO7jCP_4lCDg4UsRRQ5-vjoUk4W9ng4XZkQhjhM7ysYQ4a3wHtKwSLQDyx"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VBBbU6SzwMI8lIS4rm8lqqzsfXFymsDyX4LnkK1WmJtSOroMrHsrjU6fIuSU83HM8w""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 31, 2022",1711094747000,"2.3.1","Kolejne nowości nadchodzą:<br>1. zmiany na liście zakupowej - lepiej widoczna opcja usuwania listy oraz mniejsze poprawki<br>2. widoczność płatnosci BLIK bez kodu na karcie Moja Biedronka<br>3. możliwość wyłączenia efektu wibracji w ustawieniach aplikacji<br>4. poprawki dotyczące stabilności i wydajności aplikacji.","[""App is hot garbage.

I changed my number a while ago and no longer have the previous number. Yet it keeps sending the 6 digit security code to my old number. I then have to click on having issues/problems and it then allows me to choose my new number where it sends the code. Don't understand why it does this as it only has my new number on the system.

I had a bank transfer that was supposed to go through a few 5 When I checked on it, my balance was still at zero and the date is pushed back.

You, pay pal, do not stop the process even when told the retailer has been contacted and you've been told. | love it, except once when they ruled in favor of a seller for a package I never received. | Great Platform | One of the best apps for minding your basic finances. | It's not bad it's just that i keep losing service and can't connect to networks I have to keep turning the same bad app off and changing the settings and making permissions on the same app | It's doing a lot better | A hacker created a PayPal account in my daughter's name and flat out stole money from her bank.

This is not a reputable company | Always works well for me | I like the app | Why is this app always blocking My sim card is this a scam or what | Very bad app I can even add my bank account | So annoyed, It's refused to Link my Bank Account | Excelente aplicación, llevo años usándola y nunca he tenido ningún inconveniente. | Someone hacked my wife's account. She caught the transaction as it was processing and reached out to PayPal. The company told her there was nothing they could do and she'd need to work with her bank instead. In other words, PayPal is powerless to stop fraudulent transactions and their customer service is horrible. | It's easy to work!! | You guys are great | can't screenshot the receipt | Awesome UI and chock-full of features!! It's even fun to use when spending or sending money!! | It's good and make easier payments from country to country | I love this app and customer staff that I have encountered have been so kind and helpful thank u pay pal | After adding double auth, keeps asking sms pin on access in the mobile app (and I got fingerprint also in the app already) as I log from unknown device.. annoying | Safe, secure transactions. Great app. | For family transaction works great | Pay pal alert good shop | Iam giving 1 stars not that i Want to due to the fact that I somehow was locked out of my account for a year, which later on PayPal has access to my bank account and took money out of my bank account without asking for my consent, when I finally figured out a way to log my account back in, I decided to remove my bank card. However, when I did so it asked for my tax file number, which I do not have. I’ve tried to contact PayPal for support, which for a year I have not receive any kind of support. | Waiting reimbursement six cases for no receive service or defect products Already contact Paypal Reimbursement difficult Receive one from US 👍 Stupidest employees 🤔 TO members 🤔 0/5 PayPal eu/fr/be 5/5 PayPal US/Russia App great good optimization no bug 5/5 Recommend attack Alain Huart | It does not work in Ghana so i don't think i should waste my time downloading it | I can't get the app to work, I want to set up a account and it doesn't want to send me a verification code!!! | Best app for transfers ever. Fast and reliable. And global. | Not a human friendy app. | A very handy service | Easy to do transactions ☺️👍🏼 | Nice app | Best of the best | Good | Miraz | It's PayPal. Good alternative to standard debit account. | Great | Easy to use. Love the pay in 3 and PayPal credit helps me to budget better. | This app is a scam | Paypal has horribly gone wrong you can't even get an agent these days I am so disappointed and nomatter what you do they keep holding your funds I don't know if it's a glitch or what's happening. I wanted assistance on this but no agents available every single day. Is this a scam please paypal can you assist me honestly this is exhausting | Where is money? | Trustful app. | Horrible app! Sent away $750 vintage stereo head unit and not only lost my head unit, but also was never refunded the money!

Jj is | May PayPal declared bankruptcy and go out of business permanently | Apparently I have automatic payments set, but it's impossible to see through the app. I was politely reminded when charged unexpectedly. | Easy to use. Quick to process and offers protection | Great | The fact that you guys put people's money on hold or suspend people for no legitimate reason is so annoying. And it's weird that this is mostly happening in third world countries (esp African countries). This behaviour is disgraceful to say the least, people have worked so hard to get that money in the first place, and its not fair that you get to take advantage of struggling people. It's almost like there's robbery going on with PayPal to be honest. Would not recommend! | Magaling magaling | None | Verry verry good apps | Soooo easy to use and very quick and safe | i download then some one took it over just like my cash app | More secure than càshapp | 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Update: their suggestions don't work either. Horrible experience. Cant finish the last step. Alternative attemptd to finish it is valid for US bank accounts only. Did paypal forget people in europe also have bank accounts? When I go to ""getting verified"" issues it keeps asking me to pick the transaction (???) I had a problem with? I try to email them through the app and it keeps showing issues and to try again later. I guess the stupid apple doesn't fall far from the stupid tree that created it | Beautiful | This app is a joke someone sent me money and it's on hold for at least 2 weeks or more and I'm not even a seller....I have no intentions on using this app for business purposes | PayPal is very interesting and fun App Thank you very much for all your service.❤🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤💖🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 | No problems as of yet very convenient for parcel package coverage actually the best xoxo | Easy peasy | EXCELLENTLY! | Maybe it's great.. | Its really convenient and quick | Couldn't even get it to make an account. Uninstalling | Hard time opening the app | I've been using PayPal for years and I love it! | Very easy and intuitive. | Always smooth never a problem | Worst. It always says that it is declined. Though, I have a legit debit card. Right now, I can't link any of my debit card. Then my money is on hold. How can I get my money, when your app don't accept a debit card? What will I do? I already use two debit, so disappointing! | I like it | Very nice app | Thanks, I have been waiting to have. | App makes me feel confident that the seller will get paid n I as the buyer will receive my merchandise. | Difficult to access monies. | Night | Just impeccable | Fast and easy | Good | Excellent | Great app | Much faster and easier using the app than attempting to log in online. | Keeps logging me out and wont recognize me | Amazing | It looks good but so difficult | Nice | Seeing how much I use this service for business, I expect to be charged a fee for processing. But when I make that rare payment to a friend or family. Then you wack me for $7.55 for using an ATM card? Come on, PayPal ,this is ridiculous and insulting, seeing how many fees you milk my business for. But with business, it's a cost to do business. On a personal level it's overly abusive fees. This is why I will make sure to use another pay service over this one, whenever possible. | Cool | I like it good app | Very simple and easy to use | I had to edit my review in order to answer you. If you deliver goods and the buyer claims he/she did not receive... The money will be refunded back even if delivered.. So PayPal is no go zone for me. O star could better describe my review | What is ZIp while registering | yabyouuuuo | Good experience with PayPal keep it up guys | Every good and helpful | Try to log into the app...put in my email and password and app closes...rinse and repeat. Won't work | It simpy does the job. I have just had problems once with donating in foreign currency but probably it depended on my settings. | It won't let me download it | Gives me push notifications for payments, which is great. The app itself is a bit slow and buggy, sometimes crashes randomly or gives generic error messages. Edit: previous review about it being broken completely seems to happen only sometimes. | Good | Was super easy to send the money overseas!! | Silently reset my currency convention option to be converting by PayPal so they can steal more money from me, be aware | I m unable to withdraw the money to mpesa account....kenya | Indicate clearly amount that I sign off on | So convenient 😀 | Easy to use and feel better protected as no one gets any of my account information. | Excellent | It's great 👍 | Five stars worthed | So frustrating 👿 | paypals website won't let customers make payments. paypal sends you to a web page that says web page not found. I have a bank card attached to my account. It insists that I add an account. Then sends you to that dead end web page. This has made my account delinquent, even though I keep trying to make a payment. don't bother with their credit card. Another company that finds ways to cheat their customers. | Never any problem with PayPal. | Excellent | PayPal's awesome | Excellent | Scammer's paradise. Never send as friends and family. Now my account is temporarily restricted and they want details from my old card that I replaced. Meanwhile the scammer continues to scam people while not getting banned. Horrible app. | Don't use them, I have used PayPal for years but I'm deleting my account. The app is so bugged, then on top of that if you make any changes it takes 7 DAYS to update your account so if someone sent you money its stuck there for 7 days. You can call support and they will give you security questions to answer but BEWARE if you answer right but they input the answers wrong it will lock your account for another 72 hours!! And all customer service will do is say "" oh well sorry"" | So very convenient ,financially as well as physically! | PayPal doesn't care about any of us. I get treated like a dollar sign when I call to have something fixed. | Haven't had anything I won on it | Very smooth transactions | Site will not recognize my new debit card | 👍 Great | I am sending money and it is supposed to be Friends and Family and I never got a prompt to change it. | Amazing | Like many others on here the app has recently started immediately closing after opening and it is very disappointing to see that this has been going on for months with no fix. The fact there are nonsensical responses to peoples reviews from PayPal that do nothing to suggest that anything is being done to address the issue is equally bad. App is now useless so good job and if you don't care to fix it or communicate with your customers properly then neither do I | This app isn't working on xiaomi.i try to sign up but it's stuck in verification code | Love the app and the security level | Atrocious app and company. Their app won't let you add money to your account in certain countries. When it does they take a huge commission and then hold the money for up to 21 business days so it's unavailable to use for a month. Avoid at all costs! | I have not encountered any problem with this App since started using it | Clean,clear and smooth! | I star and a half It keeps giving me I'm not robot | Awesome | Easy to use | Easy to use | Great | Easy to use | I thought PayPal wil be nice but this routing thing they ask where the hell must we find it if your bank don't have one how does the absa people get in PayPal? | People hacked up all the time | I am satisfied for the fastest way | Easy and fast | extremely bad option and too much complicated app for an option to send money, they charged me money to verify card and still is not verified , i uninstalled it immediately | Cannot link to bank account | Never use anyone else | Does exactly what it says but don't use for large amounts to send to people. The exchange rate is extortionate pro rated. | Easy to use no fuss Still great ! | Fast secure easy | Good for day tow day | Good | These is app is very and easy to operate | At times, even though you jump thru all the security hoops, out in the passcode sent to you BY the Site, they still deny your payment. What's the point of asking me to put in a passcode , if you are just going to refuse to let me complete payment? | Tip top Flip flop | Love PayPal very reliable I pay all my online shopping through PayPal. | Op | Good | So far, so good | So quick and secure couldn't be more pleased","{""1"":575016,""2"":82977,""3"":113547,""4"":256937,""5"":2135566}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","PayPal Mobile","PayPal+Mobile","app-feedback@paypal.com","https://www.paypal.com/mobile",,"https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full","PayPal+Mobile","Finance","FINANCE","[{""name"":""Finance"",""id"":""FINANCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bDCkDV64ZPT38q44KBEWgicFt2gDHdYPgCHbA3knlieeYpNqbliEqBI90Wr6Tu8YOw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fNOZcpDpBdSZE7EM-PDUY1b9pKMr9g0JGLZ6jWqGXoRNhhx51L9g30EXYSjeAgUk318","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tjyfNdjMo-dqXyy3tFbd3PsaVebLzLzKg82T9QyGVSszzX7FiL5iEPcdkhaTrJXa"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X95Ev9OTyqKHb_slpLVR3YpLQVl0RgCPuWpKcz11dX26xOW-Uf-tUA942e9v4VftiRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4phE3toovKZ8sT9cCXhrNIRiALW_ISt9v0KGDJZnbTe13IGszcC1tazqFFEsPK4dyo9A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kc16FViVEbFA0amkFGvtd45jL0JKGxAXGobUfcQ4CkzB-nWPywKGwxzhTDjWwvNHtwQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Eawz4fyhFrdac4al7Xib_QZ--SdyMK8NfUuy7LsGPQ2TyRJEUthE2CfFhlt2NZapgw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VkxsddOuNm_-Y4T2Sp5A-ORN6xiofF-sMjMr-Qs2dDhZGZRwGu9WT3m_OrjUDJJ7lNI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sWP9g6xo1wqdN60PZ1Srln4iOQNthNONYm7ipzsh4BltAJQprXKVTXCCP0MUy9xhBBE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BLY3m61uD_B0_m6rI61JEtBOcSzbvXVMrXu531AwXJzNwDCtzJFj8tdQuffAW0EVA0C1""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,,1711140596000,"8.58.0","Do more with PayPal, with more power packed into a single app. Shop the world with ease, send payments near and far, and much more.

"KB Klíč","The KB Klíč app verifies your identity and safely logs you into MojeBanka online banking and Komerční banka's other online apps. You don't have to enter a texted code and you also authorise payments through the app.

You need the following for KB Klíč activation:
- KB ID, which you will find in the Electronic Signature Agreement. You can also use your username/email
- An activation code that you will receive at a KB branch or when you log into mujprofil.kb.cz otherwise than via KB Klíč

The activation guide is available at 
https://www.kb.cz/en/new-login-methods#kbklic

Set the PIN on the occasion of activation. You can set up your fingerprint if your phone supports them. Komerční banka will never see your fingerprints; they are retained in a secure repository in the phone.

If your phone is connected to the internet the request to confirm the activation will be received automatically in your phone. Check and confirm the request. If offline, select 'The device is not connected to the internet' option in your computer. Using the KB Klíč app, scan the pictorial code from the computer's screen. Then confirm the code by the PIN or fingerprint. Finally, type the generated code in your computer.

Please note: If you enter an incorrect PIN five times KB Klíč blocks access. You will then activate the apps using an activation code that you will receive in an ATM, at a KB branch or after logging into mujprofil.kb.cz otherwise than via KB Klíč.

KB Klíč will not work for you if you have reinstalled software on your phone and your platform (root) is therefore not protected.

I think that it is a bug and it makes me feeling uncomfortable - if there are bugs, how secure it can be? It also does not help that the bank dismissed my concerns, saying that observed incidents somehow prove app's security. Such BS! Obviously, they have no idea what they are talking about...

A student could probably do a better job. They give you a pin code for the app but the code is wrong, it blocks you out after a few tries and it tells you to call a number. You call this number, wait half an hour only for them to tell you to go visit the bank instead of resolving the issue over phone like a normal person. This should be a question of ten minutes instead you have to go through hoops cause the app was made by people who have no idea how to code. | Top banka,all recommended!! | Fast | stupid procedure for re-new of the login to app and key app in ATM, change device via SMS not working (error msg appears) - updated: ID is as in internet banking, not mobile banking .... | Amazingly fast | Solid | Had problems with transfering to another phone...caused by versions of apps on both phones weren't completely same | Perfect | Dělá co má bez problémů | Perfect and continuously improving... | Best app, easy to use and convenient 👌 | Aplikace i banka jsou naproste fiasko.

Easy to use and efficient. But like all technology, when something goes wrong, you're screwed. For example, you forget your password or you lose your phone then it can be quite a nuisance. | Bad.

Spokojenost | It works | Easy to use | Works well! | Works the way it was intended. | Terrible | Velmi rychlé a intuitivní. | Jako vsechbo od KB... | Easy and fast | Awful. First you block update of mojebanka with this app. I installed it all good 3 month ago. You didn't give me option to install it on second phone like George. Shame on you. Than you stop sending sms for online payments. Double shame on you. During last Internet payment you ask it to confirm via kb app and when i access it i find message i need to get activation key. This is plain stupid. To finish online payment i have to visit atm to get new key? How much more problems you can make???? | Love it | Fast and easy authentication. | Super, rychlé a spolehlivé. | Works well enough | Špatný. Oproti předchozím certifikátům velké snížení zabezpečení.

It would be better if you could just authenticate with fingerprint | Funguje jak má... 😊 | Hezký nápad a používá se to příjemně. Z webového prohlížeče už ale není možné zablokovat mobilní bankovnictví v případě ztráty mobilu (na blokační linku se totiž blbě volá bez mobilu a doteď se tam dalo dostat přes prohlížeč díky certifaku) | Efficient and effective app | The application should be refreshed manually in order to approve a pending for payment item, e.g.in George a newly awaiting for approval payment pops-up automatically. | Convenient | neskutečně otravná záležitost EDIT: Otravné je to proto, že to cpete všem. Proč musí být přihlášení na můj téměř prázdný účet tak složité? Chápal bych to u účtů s významnějším obnosem. | Obecně aplikace funguje dobře. Jen by neměla zapomenout nastavení otisku při aktualizaci. PIN už jsem v hlavě neměl. Vzhledem k tomu, že možnosti odblokování při pobytu mimo ČR neexistují a oficiální stránky KB mají špatné informace (KB Klíč nelze získat online, viz kb.cz/cs/nove-zpusoby-prihlaseni), budu muset pár měsíců vydržet s přihlašováním přes bezpečnostní heslo.

Strašně dlouho jsem čekal, než dorazí nějaký kód. Když nic nepřicházelo, aplikaci jsem zavřel. Kód nakonec dorazil. Když jsem aplikaci otevřel, chce to znovu verifikovat mobil. 😞 Na tyhle věci nemám náladu. | It doesn't actually show any useful info. No map with courier lication like DPD does. Just the same info from email repeated, nothing else. | Broken app, crashes when trying to register a phone number. Untested tragedy by development. 27/02/2024 Still no fix. | The app crashes during the sign up. Again and again.... | The set up is annoying, the e-mail takes for Ever to receive... | The app is turning off by itself | Nuti instalovat appku pro jednoduchou zmenu doruceni, s overenim emailu a cisla je to na 5min a pak 3s kliknuti a potvrzeni. User experince na urovni ztraty casu. Kdybych si mohl vybrat dorucovaci firmu, tak vyberu rozhodne konkurenci nez tyhle klauny | The app crashes during sign up after typing in phone number for verification. If opened again, the whole process is deleted and you start over, leading again into another crash. Tried everything, force closing, cleaning cache, uninstalling and installing, nothing worked. If we take into account that the ""only way"" to change the time and place of your arriving order is through the app it almost feels illegal to limit costumers this way. Tl;dr: Dont try this app, not even the company is trying. | During registration crashes, every time. Impossible to register and without registration useless... | Crashes after entering phone number | Useless, it crashes immediately | Works as intended with no issues | App crashes during the setup. It asks for phone number and that's its death already. | App works fine, but delivery company is absolutely useless with couriers that don't care about getting their job done, and the app can't fix that. App doesn't provide anything useful besides information that you already get with text messages and emails. And it doesn't account for couriers to have a mind of their own in regards to when you should be expecting them to arrive. | app doesn't work at all. | Don't send you sms that a package is ready for a pickup, just an email that it was sent back to sender as it wasn't picked up. | I would like to say all of the bad words about your delivery service and application. Why in God's name do you not have who the sender is next to the tracking number? Who made this app? A child? | Aplikace neumožňuje ani otevření boxu ani zobrazení pinu pro otevření. Což by se zrovna hodilo v momentě, kdy z nějakýho důvodu nechodí SMSky s pinem | So you have to install an app just to check where your package is... Seems very forced and annoying, but OK. But after installing it, they want you to verify your phone number, but the verification code never comes. Absolute trash. | Setup is not working. App crashes right after I type in phone number. | Confirmation mail just wouldn't come for any of my mail boxes. And button for sending other one doesn't work. And I couldn't use it without it or anything | dobrý den, pokaždé když zadám telefonní číslo, aplikace spadne, takže mám sice 10 ověřovacích kódů, ale jsou mi k ničemu. zřejmě by to chtělo malinko doladit :-) | Aplikaci trvá 15 minut než pošle email s ověřením a když už přijde tak je už odkaz neplatný protoze stihl expirovat. Nepoužitelné | SMS to get in takes like 10 minutes to come. Then the code is not working. | can't use it at all - I open the app, enter phone number and then it crashes | Hrůza | Absolutely useless | Zásilka se mi nechce otevřít v aplikaci. Detail zasilky je jen šedý, když ho otevřu a přes web na mobilu nelze nic udělat. | Ceska posta je oproti teto sluzbe zlata. Nechapu proc si musim kvuli zmene data doruceni baliku instalovat aplikaci, v ktere to pak stejne nejde. Spolehlivost dorucovani je uzasna. V jednom pripade mi nikdo nedal vedet, ze mi prijde balicek a nasledne mi prislo upozorneni, ze ho mam ulozeny na vydejnim miste desitky kilometru od bydliste. V dalsim pripade, kdyz jsem rekl kuryrovi, ze nejsem doma, tak mi brecel do telefonu, ze opetovne doruceni ho bude stat penize. | Well it doesn't have real time GPS tracking and schedule like for example DPD or something similar... Rather disappointing because the app is relatively useless, just knowing the delivery timeframe is not enough, which is already provided by email. What's the point of installing the app as a buyer. | Forced registration in application? For what reason? I have parcell number, refference nunber and that's enough! Thanks, but i'll pass this. First and last time. | It asked you for mail and phone verification but does not provide pin for particular package pickup so you still need to carry all mail or sms (note that the pin is sent only once but planty other spam reminders almost every day) | App froze in the middle of setup, wouldn't send confirmation email for so long that it had expired by the time it finally came. Also, didn't ever want this, got roped into downloading it because Allegro is apparently too cheap to also run a webpage with info on packages. Put me off the whole service. Thanks, but no, thanks, never again | Doufal jsem ze uvidim polohu kuryra, tj. nejake presnejsi info o tom kdy zasilka dorazi, ale nedozvite se nic vic nez je na webu. Naprosto zbytecna aplikace, v podstate malware... Edit (odpoved Adamovi z WE|DO): To co pisete neni pravda. V aplikaci je videt stav zasilky, napriklad zda je na ceste nebo v depu, coz se dozvim i z webu. Neni zde zadna informace o jeji presnejsi poloze, napriklad kde priblizne je kuryr nebo za jak dlouho ke mne dorazi. | To bojujete s českou poštou o nejhorší servis? | There is no parcel tracking, just the same info you get in SMS | Repeatedly told me that I don't have any package to receive even though I had | Neni mozne ani zacit pouzivat aplikaci. Verification email bud neprijde vubec nebo se zpožděnim a jiz expirovanym linkem. | App is not in English. The website is | Zbytečná aplikace. | Naprosto odporný přístup společnosti, která vyžaduje použití mobilní aplikace k pouhé změně termínu doručení. Aplikace neopodstatněle vyžaduje potvrzení mobilního čísla a emailu. Jsou společnosti, které si zákazníků váží a umožní obsloužit zásilku jednoduše skrze web. Wedo mezi ně nepatří. | Not able to register. Did not get verification email | Vyžadováno jak mobilní číslo, tak mail. SMS přišla, odkaz na mail ani po opakovaném zaslání ne (včetné kontroly spamu). Takže necunkční. | Nejde sa ani prihlasit, zasielju nejde sledovat online, ale len v appke, do ktorej nejde prihlasenie, nechapem ako moze niekto dobrovolne vyuzivat wedo | Worst app that exists, the fact that you have to download this trash to change your order is insane to me | Verifiy either mail or phone! Verify both shouldbe optional? | Aktuálně pro Vás nic nemáme... přitom mi vezete balík, škoda. (ano, email a telefon je zadaný stejný jako u zásilky) | Why do I need to install your app to track my items? I should also be able to track my items using your website. The app is not available in English. | nemůžu si ani ověřit účet protože tahle píčovina mi nepošle email | Received sms with info on my parcel and link to download the app to get more info and follow my parcel. Upon installing the app there's literally not one bit of additional information. No need to download the app.. I really wish we could get past the 3-4 hour window received from delivery companies. Don't tell me it can't be narrowed down to 30-60 minutes in this day and age with all the tech we have available. | Why to ask your customers to download the app for absolutely everything if it does not work? THE WORST APP FOR DELIVERIES. | Taky se musim přidat k předchozím. Ponechám stranou neschopnost společnosi doručit zásilku tak jak je deklarováno. 1) aplikace vyžaduje e-mail ale zasilku z něho nenačte, na to potřebuje tel. Jenže když vám někdo pošle zásilku na jiný tel, můžete tak akorát přepínat mezi čísly. 2) Všude cpou že je aplikace potřeba na sledování a pak sem píšou že to není třeba. 3) tak primitivní věc jako sledovat zásilku dle čísla to neumí. Zato ciza aplikace to zvladne :-D Čekal bych víc | opakovane to po mne chce aktivovat aplikaci a pritom v ni nenajdu ani pin pro vyzvednuti => potreti uz jsem to neaktivoval, ale odinstaloval. PS - Pokud ve sve odpovedi naznacujete, ze ta aplikace neni ke vsemu tomu ani dostacne zabezpecna pro ulozeni pinu k zasilce, tak mam asi jeste o duvode mene, abych se ji pokousel zprovoznit. | Don't know how else to rise an issue. 20mins till I get email to verify and then the verification link does not work. I will update rating when this is fixed. | Nefunguje ověření emailu, takže se do app vůbec nedostanete... Edit: Spam jsem kontroloval. Emaily došly po půlnoci a linky už byly neplatné. Podobně email o doručování mi přišel pár hodin po doručení. | K ničemu. Když už přijde ověřovací kód na email po asi půl hodině, tak stejně nefunguje. | Incompetent delivery service that makes promises about deliveries and is not capable of keeping them. Also, instead of an interactive website, they force you to download their app and input personal data to be able to make any changes to your delivery. Sad. | V aplikaci nešlo přesměrovat zásilku do výdejního místa, musel jsem kvůli tomu otravovat kurýra, který ji tam přesměroval. Když to umí kurýr, proč to nejde v aplikaci? V aplikaci není vidět kód pro vyzvednutí zásilky. Celá WeDo služba je pro mě momentálně na úrovni PPL, DPD, čili ne moc použitelná. | Aplikace pěkná, se společností jsem také neměl žádné problémy. Jen jsem byl nucen instalovat, protože sice máte webové stránky, ale na mobilu nejde po zadání údajů zásilky kliknout na tlacitko ""vyhledat""... | Zbytečná aplikace a celkově příšerná služba. Zásilka měla přijít zítra, ale kurýr si vesele přijede dneska když nejsem doma a ještě se mu to nelíbí. Žádné upozornění mi nepřišlo. Tak si nainstaluju tuhle aplikaci abych předělal termín - nejdřív nepřišel potvrzovací email, pak tam vidím že jsou v aktivních zásilkách i nějaké rok staré už dávno doručené. Předělat dodání stejně nemůžu protože je zásilka pořád aktivní, takže to asi budu muset sledovat celý den než to v depu odkliknou. Supersračka! | Joining all the 1 star reviews. I just need to know when the parcel will arrive. You don't need my phone and email to show me that. Update after app-dev reply: then why do you send SMS with the link to the app and not with the link to the web?? | Problém už jen při registraci, vůbec mi to neposlalo mail pro ověření. A to jsem to zkoušel hodněkrát ! | Dalsia zbytocna aplikacia ktora mohla byt web. Namiesto linku na zasielku ma nutite stiahnut si tuto nefunkcnost. Viem ze v sms je sledovacie cislo a viem ze ked to vykopirujem tak mi to ukaze vsetko na webe. Je tak tazke prilozit link ktory to spravi sam? | their web is forcing me to download this, the web is nonfunctional | Nesmyslně složitý proces pro získání stavu zásilky. Proč prostě nemůžu dostat odkaz na webovou stránku. Tak jako to dělají všichni ostatní obchodníci/přepravci. | Zbytečná aplikace. Sledování zásilky ukazuje jiná data než webový portál. 3 dny čekám na balík, důvod - výdejní box mimo provoz. Aplikace ukazuje plánované doručení v minulosti a že je balík na cestě do depa. Z aplikace není možné balík přesměrovat na jiný výdejní box. Absurdní v dnešní době ... | Nepoužitelné, pouze pro informaci = zdá se, že to neumí nabídnout více informací než člověk obdrží v SMS. Číslo objednávky není možné nikde v aplikaci zkopírovat i po přepsání a snaze změnit místo doručení, aplikace nerozpozná objednávku. Seznam odběrových míst se načítá tak dlouho, že jsem to vzdal. Asi beta test verze. | Aplikace úplně k ničemu. Nejdřív chce email a telefon a potom nedokáže zobrazit moje zásilky (kvůli tomu jsem si ji stahnul).","{""1"":905,""2"":19,""3"":29,""4"":38,""5"":194}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Allegro Retail a.s","Allegro+Retail+a.s","info@wedo.cz","http://wedo.cz",,"https://www.wedo.cz/gdpr","Allegro+Retail+a.s","Events","EVENTS","[{""name"":""Events"",""id"":""EVENTS""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5mz_pbf_KCrM_dqnXWNulk79Ky6fQQPcE989h0pAlvXqwOEngkRt1Dhsz2tyFHuI8oY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pH3yyGchsXNLNbeCx6d1xr9yS4OmztHVDpJCbCKJ80a-j-CLWbS-rn6CM3Ejj6IgtMQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VJ-XAd5nu1aT9PlBaX7TDyusTu9Dsuaaf6MSnE7ycsGY6xFX3wCihx_BUBbfMIouI0I"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nyuoc2LB79luoAKvzjSa8DPpxkFXBG5tbX7dDoDHRW30M_Q0xaPX6pa4MC44I3vALKvT"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pmksx4fO7p15IiH4eyzqnxMHUrzRwF7I02Bmx1EOAw43fZN6LJHYBFAGtNIykuh7QuY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Yi7f81sGZZlYTv8gn57xjRKoCp7ZZz0gFHOUSsxEdVONh82k-m9dRsFtoFSll39zd-U"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/K2vbGkaxE_spY7KzwPV4Pb_o50ydtxjh6cRjIbNwP9dCh8DfQqDTibfD91SS7ZTfWY4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KWmiOkHUzFkoUeTVz_fBzK4filI3pQ0wMBlX7ULam4NOeCA0YXy7iEh4re4N8msK6A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BfovATTwOriSPW3YPsQ6irTnJIfn4_0uHwaVF2hnfAwvTbBIxhgye7_t1fLhdVCHbObu"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6VJ7fQ7bRDOzGwzZETN4IB05t2aThKNq5aOibgfEKUlCBzJbMS-o_47RVhFtbTIBOS81"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FfN11s1lUbCcrymr92WJvA1hGir0ybNBW3ReI8Otfk-zO2WViKtLfmYJ6QGNNEe4qw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0WcSla86uiQ6RNPxeeX-Leo3LrZxCB6GYMVW42jLOjW-I-Mp6zmtH0RExsBtkQQFECrj"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Z6KbBLqr4mtgigbhLc3ebb3OWo5Qkgg5KIaJZdaDuE5ezI102c4JT9tEszeJoTFSWf8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XAaz0n8UcvdZes3apMzrMBdHdnhQF1cdz5bCRwPTY9CV6J4PSpXimkzAau6cyrMTlQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A3ZlwDU8d3Tp5czyF7JQaSKsspBDSv0PONnyy79VyJFH9M7ljvMC7fcG85295DmJkdRy"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7depV3CWA5NRtWfPOTfF5PBhmobdqrwZN-sMOjDfXSauUWGGg3x-RSJjLns8eiyzQMZf"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RTeS3wUlLAJFCeLuV7pg4JNMSHf3zCrotcXp3aNFQ3H8W3KbYfSit_cAI_qnnAgbEZVA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RKdQOU2S3-2eKBvA25OnUJbjHgyad1ZkB42iPt7ApmolwOJJhJbv864I7j9o_6Xg-Y0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UhNFNrEKswgLrH8DygouBJLbP2Pq0vfm_z5FcY93dWrYRZCc8_UeaaqV6AK82GCEVg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9fXgtBN3aCM71lO8m9jNdUaW-I7oh0K7bV_qvYfz1MaDpvtoa1pvzfZstoBhMUX08FI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gPsEe6-8k1M1NF3OnO6SZtwAIUbHVrVzWqZrUMKY3kNlaVu8GuZibPxVlnvcRBRWFVo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AAAXtpScxZU35kl7A_s2q7mfBNH41yOtKvGdRElWWuFwlbbEL4w4GMkWTXnBuqgpMwD0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1fxI7rJv-8-WlwcqGPa8plumvlm7gtPp8UEjOvoRvaEGwAWApxlTo9fv6q6kD7bmyos"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DYnRdFMJs9c9ifuJAqAhDJnmiR4CA61uV-5EbauJD_PxY6phkbA3rPaOKp0OpTVw7w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sGiv1GF-BwctbLpzJkZxUXFeoSOEZ50yXkrlrdAWDdYoIezvwy8jPy5sfKHtbxOwbG-_"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OZq5Oq21ytHR0kXHMJy2Fny51tnqE7KjaH9esfeOqSp09WDZXWewdlQAZ_scCKA8HYhH""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jun 1, 2022",1701893849000,"1.1.9",,"[""The app crashes during sign up after typing in phone number for verification.

Doesn't sound like something you'd use a second time, does it Tesco. | I have to log in every time i open the app. It is very annoying. Hey, this is not online banking... | Vcelku ntuitivni GUI.

UPDATE: dnes nejde menit mnozstvi zbozi v kosiku, ani jej odebrat. Snizuji hodnoceni o ☆. | Dobré služby- vyhledávání je dobré, ještě chce zapracovat na filtrování nejen podle značek. Docela mě zarazilo po přidání některých položek do košíku, že nejdou později odebrat ani upravit jejich množství (ovoce a zelenina). | It's fine, prices are ok, offered groceries are fine, search works fine, app speed is ok. But my big disappointment is called ""The weight limit"". I don't really understand that. There was some meaning in lockdown times, but today it is completely pointless. | 👍 | Použijte raději Albert domů zdarma :) | Android appka se možnostmi nevyrovná webové appce. Použití křestního, navíc neskloňovaného, jména v počátečním oslovení je neslušné, já si s appkama netykám. | I'm getting error 500 when I'm trying to register. | Automaticky přidávané oblíbené nejde od-oblíbit. Neustálá nutnost přihlašování. Vyhledávání vyžaduje přesnou shodu. Chybí breadcrumb navigace. Neustále chodí notifikace na sledované snížení ceny z předchozí verze aplikace, které v této chybí a nejdou v ní tedy ani zrušit. Nelze používat víc dodacích adres. Aspoň že samotné objednávání a dodávání funguje prakticky bezvadně. | Dobry den, prosim, muzete mi vysvetlit, proc jste zrusili moznost mit zadanych vice adres a pouze je prepinat, misto toho je ted musim pokazde zadavat znovu? Dale proc se aplikace neustale odhlasuje? Vyrazne se zhorsilo vyhledavani a napovidani. | Unlogged every day. Can't login with bitwarden, have to copy credentials manually. Doesn't work on rooted device. Edit: Maybe you've fixed first problem, but I won't check, I'll wait until issue with custom password managers is fixed. Tesco still tries to access android keychain instead of allowing to use arbitrary password manager.

Mam Pixel 6 a Android 14. Předtím úplně bez problémů, ted kliknu na Oblibene a pad aplikace, stejne kdyz vstoupím do kategorii potravin. | Asi nejhorší objednávka aplikace v Česku. Pomalá, seká se, špatně se v ní orientuje a ceny jsou nejvyšší na českém trhu. | Výběr času doručení nefunguje, nelze vybrat čas doručení, tak jak více z apky ani nemohl vyzkoušet :D | V nové verzi (která mne automaticky odhlásila) se nejde přihlásit. Po kliknutí na ""Přihlásit se"" se objeví jen načítání stránky, která je ale celá černá a prázdná. | Již delší dobu nefunguje přihlášení pomoci google účtu. Pro používání online verze je potřeba aplikaci vymazat, jinak ji prohlížeč automaticky otevírá. :( | After the last update I can't open details of any product - the app closes immediately. | Never logged in when I meed it and the UI is generally worse than web page. No features like scanning what you would like ahead of time. | Sekce můj košík nefunguje | Nonstop me aplikace odhlasuje z mobilni aplikace. | Cannot login because you can't copy paste into password field on your stupid website. Can't you do login in the app without using Web view? Seriously? | Nikdy neplatit předem, ani jednou jak jsem zaplatila kartou hned mi nákup nedoručili ani nenabídli žádné vyřešení. | Notifikace do telefonu s reklamami snad 2x tydne bez moznosti opt out? Tentokrát den deti, ci co. Telefon je velice personalni vec, takze tyhle notifikace mne pekne dopaluji. Mutnul jsme vsechny notifikace od vas, ale ted se ani nedozvim, když mi budete chtit pushnout neco k me objednavce. | dej slevu more | 10/10 obchod, 1/10 aplikace, chybí základní funkcionalita stránek (hlavně *filtry*, vrácení tam kde jsem byl po rozkliknuti individuálního produktu, srdíčko produktu že stránky produktu, zobrazení všech produktů značky že stránky produktu atd.) Vykucháno za hranicí uživatelnosti, aplikace se dá dobře využít akorát na přidávàní z oblíbených. | Do nedávného redesignu to byla skvělá aplikace, ale teď byla z pro mě nepochopitelného důvodu odstraněna funkce Oblíbené položky - a to nejen z rychlého menu, ale kompletně. Vzhledem k tomu, že na jejím základě sestavuji své nákupy, je pro mě teď aplikace zcela nepoužitelná... Nezbývá než se vrátit k webové verzi. Naprostý fail. | Po aktualizaci zmizela možnost přidavat položky poslední objednávky. Je to hrůza. Musíme pokaždé přidávat všechno znovu?! | A little difficult for Anglophones, but solid nonetheless. Thanks. Service is also very reliable, even though I live in a house that is kinda hard to find. 👍 | Since their latest updates last week, I cannot login to my account and asked their help. They asked me to log into my email which means log in from the email sent, but never arrived to my email inbox. They said they will let me know the updates, but never comes to me either. The app malfunction puts me off to use their services although their selection of things were good. Hugely disappointed with the current situation. | Good speed and UI. Search in English language can be enhanced. | English version missing. Apart from that very good app and service | backspace make keyboard disappear...poskal jsem vam email a video | Fast, clear and basic shopping. | Je škoda že v aplikaci nejsou vidět Nákupní Seznamy, které se používají ve webové aplikaci. | Convenient and responsive application. Better than competition's apps. | Could not pay by card in the app. I had to choose the option to pay with the courier. The button was just irresponsive. Also, there is no option to filter the certain product by the price like in online version. | Great application and great service. Everytime my all orders came in exact time and exact amount/brand. They are always helpful and listening everything what customers say. Košík is better than other shopping services in the Czech Republic. Thank you. | Košík je nejlepší! | How can I change the language in english so I can use it? | Pro uživatele registrované přes Facebook není možné se v aplikaci přihlásit (Facebook blokuje login v rámci frame) | It is OK, I can see huge progress, but still many things to improve :) | Well organized by category, easy to find products, quick without glitches. Over all, the app works very well. | Flexible and handy | Pokud otevru kategorii, z ni otevru produkt a jdu zpět, úplně ztratím stav katalogu a musim filtrovat znovu. Bohužel nepoužitelné. | Super easy to use 👍 | Working fine. | Rychlý nákup a platba! Ještě bych chtěla v menu možnost vidět Novinky. | Je to dobré. Dá se nakupovat hlasem. | Aplikace nepoužitelná. Nejdřív nešlo přidat adresu do účtu. To jsem udělal na webu a pak nešlo odeslat objednávku, protože se ""nepodařilo přidat adresu k objednávce"". Takže aplikaci prozatím mažu. | Dobrý sortiment ale nespolehlivá služba. Objednaný nákup na osmou hodinu se řidiči ""někam zatoulal"". O pár minut později telefonát - vrátit peníze nebo přivezeme nejdřív za 7 hodin. To v případě, že se na nákup spoléháte zrovna nepotěší. S Košíkem tedy naposledy. Zákazník na prvním místě nebo customer obsession, to jsou hesla ze kterých se mají české firmy ještě hodně co učit.... | English version would be great | Chybi mi moznost radit zbozi podle ceny (ceny za jednotku) a dalsi podobne ""malickosti"". | Excellent service | Waiting for the english version...have to use other competitor for now | Nice app but there is no English version, even though it's widely used by English speakers. I am sure that the management wouldn't care about this feedback because why would they, we still pay them anyway. This is what's holding this country back. They don't wanna work, yet they still wanna get paid, unbelievable. Anyway, I got used to it. | You can not login with your email after you registered with facebook. You can not change your account to activate email login. Welcome to the prehistoric times. And they lied here in response. | Does not support English | Still not translated into English 😤👎🙄⁉️ | Great servis xxx | Amazing app, very good services. One thing I can complain about is that there's no English version. I hope someone will hear it, because it is easy to do and it will help a lot of users:) You're the best 😘 | Is it possible to change the language to English or it is only in Czech? Thanks | Need English language as well.. | Good prices, clean app. | For good job | Na první pohled aplikace vypadá dobře. Když jsem začal vyhledávat zboží, zjistil jsem, že nejde řadit podle názvu/ceny/ceny za jednotku... Jde-li to, nevím kde. Žádný help, průvodce... Pro mě bez řazení nepoužitelné a zdržující. | The app itself is OK but the actual delivery of ordered goods is terrible. Every single time the driver forgets to deliver one or two bags. Every single time. | Terrible! When you look at a favourite product it's there for order. When eventually you have got to the checkout it becomes unavailable! I will give my money to a company which can deliver! Zero stars! | Application works great, grocery delivered on time. Overall great service, can't complain! | Aplikace funguje a je přehledná. Jedné co mi chybý je možnost seřadit zboží podle ceny, kvůli tomu musím přeskakovat na webový prohlížeč. | Cool | Super apka. Akorát chybí tlačítko bez Andreje :) a bez palmového oleje. A chybí řazení dle ceny, nebo jsem lama a nevšiml jsem si ho. | 👍 | App doesn't work.. | Aplikace je prakticky nepoužitelná, daleko horší než aplikace od Rohlik.cz a Tesco. Nelze měnit řazení výrobků (např. řadit podle ceny), nelze se prokliknout z detailu výrobku (který jsem našel třeba přes vyhledávání) zpět na seznam všech výrobků v dané kategorii. Lepší je použít obyčejný web Kosik.cz než tuhle příšernou aplikaci :-( | Velky spatny, server hlasi chybu... Uz tyden se tahle hlaska objevuje a neni mozne nakupovat. | Totálně nepřehledné, bez možnosti filtrování a kategorií. Vyhledávání podivné - hledám Mattoni, zadám matto a zboží nenalezeno. přidám jedno písmeno - matton a už vidím Mattonky. Musíte se víc snažit... | moc spatne ... temer nefunkcni vyhledavani a nutnost najednou povolit jak reklamni emaily tak informace o objednavce ... | Kategorizace produktů je opravdu tragická.

Less and less useful with every update | Děs a hrůza. Když si naléhavě potrebuji objednat lístek, aplikace nefunguje. Když si chci objednat něco na jídlo, aplikace samozřejmě nefunguje. Dále bych vypíchl příšerný systém placení. Proč při placení Google Pay musím do prohlížeče a nemůžu transakcí udělat v aplikaci?! Jakto že to ve kterékoliv jiné aplikaci funguje, jenom zde ne. Chybí například detaily a aktuální polohy spojů po vzoru ČD. Kdybych se měl vyjadřovat k celkové kvalitě služeb RegioJet, tak je to na slohovku... | Can only order and pay via app, unfortunately it tells me that I can not order due to my arrival in less than 40 minutes. I actually will arrive in two hours.. | Poslední dobou samý problém. Výpadky denne, teď už 3 dny nelze zaplatit kreditem ani stornovat na kredit. Vše musím stejně dělat na webu. | your new update sucks it deleted all my tickets from the app while i am onboarding and gave me a mini heart attack its a good thing i had my ticket number. Do better software team | Omluváme se, ale tato recenze narazila na chybu | Useless. You cannot log in with the ecistijg ticket number and you are forced to create new one | Im using Regiojet for a solid 7 years and always everything great, but such thing like today I have never seen ever. On the journey Prague-Leon we were on time until the driver forgot/left a passenger on a stop after short break. 2 hours later the driver forgot/left his own colleague (second driver) at Lausanne. So we drove 20km out the city then he realized that he forgot him and we had to go back and they made a dilay of 30 min..... | Regiojet se asi zbláznil, že kvůli změně příjmení nebo EMAILU musím na prodejní místo s dokladem totožnosti a musím prokazovat ""nárok na změnu"". Nic takového jsem ještě u žádné online služby nezažil. Co asi tak mám na emailu prokazovat a proč s dokladem na pobočce? | Vše funguje jak má. | Absolutely nothing works | Booking is fine, but the Login option is very bad. You can only login with an actual ticket (not with a past one) or with Regiojet Pay. So if you have none, you simply cannot login, cannot see your own account, credit etc. It should be possible to login with a user account. | For Me It was a very wonderful trip, Serve was good and on time. One extra star for them for the commitment because I forgot my luggage in the bus so i write an email they called me within 2 minutes and told me they found it in the bus and after 2 hours they delivered me the luggage on the same station were i waa told to stand.... Thank you so much... | Does not start at all. | Seriously not giving an updated info about delay. At some point, the schedule suddenly gone when the delay is more than two hours. It would be nice if they keep updating it especially for travellers who doesn't know any local languages. Eventually, for successing delays, the train didn't arrive. Not even a single notice. | People in the train put them large baggage on the top shelfs and staf doesn't nothing with this... It is not safety for people around this baggage | Only option how to ""order"" service in train. Not working... Tragic | Po pěti minutách od instalace této aplikace jsem zjistil, že se jedná o špatnou aplikaci 👎🏼. Například v notifikační liště se mi zobrazuje, že vlak 🚆 je v polovině své trasy avšak vlak ani nepřijel do mé výchozí stanice 🤦‍♂️. Nebo to telefon probouzí snad každých 10 sekund nebo mne to během používání aplikace bezdůvodně odhlásí a je potřeba se znovu přihlásit, atd... | Placení přes telefon pořád nejde. Udělejte s tím neco, prosím. | Doesn't support Google Wallet | Keeps crashing | Why cannot person login via Google, Apple or Facebook in 2023? I need to put some ticket number and password that I don't even know..... Very bad experience.... | Used this in middle Europe with ease and found it very useful | I don't understand why there isn't an option to order the free refreshments on the tablet itself. Maybe not the paid once, because of security but there is zero reason not to do it for the coffee/tea. I do not want to download and figure out a new app and log-in details,... for the sole purpose of ordering free beverage that was advertised. I believe most people would not even bother because this is kinda ridiculous. | Disaster of app or i would say service, i pay some extra for coffee abd the app was not working, the guy which was serving told me we are arriving in 40 min. Lol i want to spend my money and buy water! | I booked 2 seats next to each other (for me & my mom). They changed the type of the carriage, which would've been okay, but they also changed our seats, one was number 34, the other 91. The app itself works fine. I will probably choose different means of transportation next time, or at least different provider. | The quality of service and app functionality is constantly degrading. | Každou chvíli timeout. Nemohu dobít kredit z aplikace ani se přihlásit na webu. | Tehy provide good service, prices are fair and lets you cancel your ticket with full refund until 15 mins before the trip. This has changed with its competitors. And compare to them, Regiojet offers more comfortable trips at better prices. Of course there are also some small issues like internet is not working well and the driver/assistant might not be always very friendly but these issues exist in most tranportation companies throughout Europe. So, I give 5 out 5 for this Czech Student company | proc nepisere v apce platformu vlaku? to asi bude nejaka vesmirna zahada... | Vynikajici service ,ridic pomahal s kuframa nalozit I vylozit.. Diky | Search not working | The only reason I had the app was for the refreshments. For at least six months this feature has not been working for me. In the refreshments tab it simply never loads the seat I have reserved so I can't really order. | I bought ticket to one seat, but it was changed to another one, not same quality. No booked seats from application, super cool. It is better to buy regular ticket than in application, because they would not change it. | After last update, shortly after start, I see nothing just yellow screen. Even more useless app than before. | Nejen že aplikace není moc použitelná když na většině delších tratí není pokrytí internetem. Ale navíc neustále vyhazuje chybu spojenou s počtem requestu. Výsledek je aplikace úplně k ničemu. | It just doesn't work during the trip, it's constantly logging me out, just not possible to order refreshments | Never use the services of these company. Multiple times they cancelled our wagon without compensation! | I was take the train from vilklosony to Praha and the bavarge order in app not work like most of time and they say that work by order in person but they say wait 1 or 2 Hours to make 1 order. That's really so bad experience for me | Aplikace je velmi pomalá, zasekana. Během chvilky vám rozpálí mobil a spotřebuje celou baterií. Mně se dokonce mobil přehrál a sám vypnul. Služby společnosti v aplikaci jsou ale překvapivě ještě horší. Vlak, kterým jsem měl v 8 ráno odjet mi den předem v 8 večer zrušili. Nedočkal jsem se náhradního spoje ani žádné jine kompenzace. Podle přepravních podmínek máte možnost místa na stání, to však nikdo nenabídne a ani to není možné. Arogantní přístup zralý až na COI. | Fraud, you should rather buy your snacks/drinks in the store. Got charged but didn't get what I payed for. | Horrible experience with password reset. | Aplikácia je čistá lotéria, ale myslím, že v rulete mám vyššie šance na úspech. | Po pokusu o koupení lístku se zobrazí jen bílá stránka. EDIT: Opraveno | Pres aplikaci si nemuzu objednat zadne jidlo, nic nenabizi, aplikace zkratka nefunguje. Na upozorneni stewardky mi bylo doporuceno si objednat jidlo pres nekoho jineho komu aplikace funguje | Cannot paste password for the login. Does not support MFA / 2FA. Please update your app to 2023 standards... | Nefunguje pridanie lístka, obtiažna a zbytocna registrácia | Самая конченная компания, если вам не жалко своих нервов то можете воспользоваться это отсталой гнилой конторой. Меняют места как хотят, отменяют вообще билеты. Не советую, не рекомендую. Обходите это г... десятой дорогой | The app is broken most of the times. | What a stupid app. We entered our ticket number that showed on our ticket but the app said it's a wrong ticket number. We couldn't ordered food on the train. We were starving. The food only was ordered through the app. | Táto aplikácia vo mne už dlhodobo vyvoláva pri používaní čistú frustráciu a dneska to bohužiaľ vyvrcholilo týmto hodnotením. 10 pokusov objednať si kávu vo vlaku prekladaných generickými error hláškami, samovoľným odhlásením z aplikácie, ďalšími error hláškami, neresponzívnym UI. Bol som tak rád, že sa mi konečne podarilo pridať item do košíka a skončilo to aj tak ďalšou chybou (surprise surprise - znova generickou) pri objednávaní. Prosím prepíšte to. Tento paskvil sa nedá nazvať aplikáciou. | This was the first time (and hopefully the last time) i had to install an app to buy a snack. Having to figure out password for the account used to but a ticket to get a Kofola is not a good idea. Mostly useless, everything the app does either already is a web page or could have been a web page. Does not work when internet connection drops out during the train trip, i have lost the log in when this happened. In summary: boooooo | obcerstvenie je problematicke a temer nikdy nefunguje(dajte si to uz pls dokopy) | Ita a dissapointment how often the app doesnt work because of ""maintenance"". You cant search tickets. You cant pay. Payments options dont show. Payments crash and then tickets are cancelled without notice. It just doesnt work. Also app randomly signs out, and you cant log in with other option than ticket number or RegioPay. Would be real nice to be able to register via third party e.c. Google account. Please fix this app. | Doesn't work | 1) Během rezervace sedadla by bylo fajn vidět, zda-li někdo v mém okolí cestuje se psem (pro alergiky). 2) Notifikace o probíhající jízdě se aktualizuje dost často a předpokládám, že bude mít neblahý vliv na baterii. Zároveň má hádám velkou prioritu a často vyskakuje jako nová notifikace na zamknutém zařízení. Bylo by fajn mít separátní channel pro notifikaci o odjezdu a notifikaci o probíhající jízdě (tu bych si rád vypnul). | Dala bych nula hvezdicek, kdyby to slo. Opakovane instaluju, abych si objednala jidlo, ale to proste neni mozne! Catering je nedostupny... nechapu. | It's a terrible app | Great!!! | RegioJetem jezdím docela často a aplikace ti opravdu kazí. Systém objednávek prostě nefunguje spolehlivě - objednávky evidentně stevardům chodí pozdě, nebo vůbec; často není možné objednávku zaplatit ani kreditem, natož pak platební kartou; To že nešlo zaplatit člověk nepozná, protože aplikace neupozorní ani na úspěšnou ani neúspěšnou platbu; Při sebemenším problému s připojením celý systém nereaguje; jestli po zaplacení opravdu jídlo přijde je taky někdy loterie ... i ČD tyto základy zvládá | Quite user-unfriendly mess. Czech national railways have a much better and more reliable app that provides more info. The worst issue for me is that in case when your train is running with a delay, it still vanishes from the connections section at the planned time of arrival! So after the scheduled arrival time, you can no longer watch your delay in the app and must rely on 3rd party train trackers to e.g. synchronize with people going to pick you up. You can't even re-book to a higher class! | The app is broken, there are so many reviews complaining, yet they do not fix it. They force the customer to use to app to order, yet they won't have a functioning app. What a stupid system. | Objednávanie občerstvenia nefunguje | Ordering food didn't work, tickets randomly disappear form app. It's frustrating and sad at the same time because last year it worked well. | When it works, it's fine. The problem is, it shows that there is a system maintenance most of the time (which to me seems like just a generic error message because sometimes restarting the app works). That is really convenient when you're trying to show your ticket to the bus driver 🙃 Ordering food on trains is also unreliable. | app is really hard to use and it allow you to order food without warning and then just cancel your order out of nowhere | What happened with my credit about 280 CZK, remaining????? | jednou kdyz jsem si zaplatil vlak z Brna na Videnske letiste, ale na Hbf ve Vidni vlak zastavil a az po nekolika minutach se personal obtezoval nam sdelit, ze ten vlak dal nepojede a ze si mame vystoupit, tak mi regiojet nejprve odmital vratit me penize za neuskutecnenou cestu Wien Hbf - Wien Flughafen. Nasledne kdyz mi je konecne formou kreditu vrátili, tak poté mi je, nez jsem kredit stihl využít, opet strhli. Doporučuji využít jiné dopravce. Regiojet je zlodejska spolecnost | Can't say it's toooo bad, but I've got lots of fun at once, during attempt to pay meal, got logout, had to reset password.. 3 times, also train was 30 minutes late, but it ask to rate before trip end :-D | App crashes constantly - troubles with payment for refreshments. Money is gone from the bank account but the app didn't register it - food never arrived. | Ordering of food and drinks didn't work during my trip from Bratislava to Prague and there was no restaurant wagon, so it was not possible to get anything, because the waiters had training sessions and were not available. Wifi was also not working. Toilet was overflowing and I witnessed a RegioJet employee yelling at one of the passengers and in front of other waiters who were in training. | Your train is delayed 2 hours? Well too bad, you can't order food because the app thinks your train ride is already over. | Opakované dlouhodobé výpadky serveru z důvodu ""údržby"" znemožňují vše od vyhledávání spojení až po přihlášení do aplikace. | absolutně nefungujea plikace ani web, kazdy den ma ta aplikace problém a nedokáže se na ni nic udělat. K tomu jsem za 10 minut 3x refreshnul stránku abyvh si mohl koupit jednu pitomou jízdenku a cena se zvedla 3x celkově o dvacet korun na lowcost. | It used to be a good app. But for like a month now I can't load up my tickets when I most need them because ""the app is under maintenance"" all the time. If you could do something about it like doing it sometime at night and not when people are traveling it'd be kindly appreciated. | They say I can order food/drinks ONLY from the app, but app says ""catering unavailable"". Other people can order, I am on a route that I am supposed to be able to order. Very bad experience. | The app is alright-ish, very often it keeps displaying ""connection error"". But the service on board has declined tremendously, from great to zero. They claim there is coffee in the bus, but often the self-service machine is simply not working | Nanhoria applikacia. Po registraci sa mi tam neda pridat ticket a jedlo si nemozem objednat. Najhorsia aplikacia v strednej europe | aktuálně je po otevření jenom bílá obrazovka. smazání cache nepomůže. no, tak s vama asi nepojedu no. | What's the point in creating an account with your email and password, if you cannot use those credentials later on to log in??? | In most of the time, the app doesn't work. It's really fascinating, how bad the app is, I think I don't know any other app, which works so little. | Great that Ui and navigation is intuitive. Things to improve: Critical: - System maintanace shouldn't happen or should happen at night, not when entering the bus. Medium: - When ticket is bought and added in tickets section it should disapear from cart section. - Application crash sometimes | V aplikaci už delší dobu nefunguje možnost objednávání občerstvení, i když je to jediný možný způsob, jak si ve vlaku objednat. Objednávky u stevardů totiž nejsou možné. Jezdím regiojetem často a tak jsem na tuto skutečnost už zvyklá. Avšak někoho, kdo často nejezdí a spoléhá na občerstvení ve vlaku, to může nemile zaskočit. Otázkou je, proč tato chyba není napravena, protože podle komentářů zde nejsem jediná, komu objednávky nefungují. Dalším problémem je strašně dlouhé načítání platební brány. | Smutné, kéž by se přes to dalo něco objednat. | App has got much better, but the connectivity with the endpoint system is unreliable thus impacting user experience. There should be no ads in this app. | Allow people to cancel ticket when the train is delayed by 15 minutes or more. You say ""15 minut before departure"" not ""15 minutes before PLANNED departure"" | Sometimes it works, sometimes totally not. | I read many negative feedback I'm surprised because the app working very fast and very amazing service.afterall very affordable price in Europe 🌍 My next journey soon ☺️ With regiojet | The worst app I have ever seen. 500 chars allowed here is not enough for describing all the things that are wrong with this app. | Jediny sposob jak objednat jedlo vo vasich vlakoch. Tesim sa z toho ze vas vysachovali zo slovenskeho trhu a dufam ze skrachujete aj v cechach | Aplikace každou chvíli nefunguje, někdy nejdou zaplatit jízdenky a objednávka občerstvení mi nenabíhá ani v jednom zen2 telefonů. | Not working. Neither is website | Half of the things doesn't work, you can't log into your account and food ordered via app takes forever till it comes to you. | Asi kvuli kolisavemu pripojeni jsem ztratil 15min instalovanim appky a objednavanim jidla, ale nakonec jsme stejne hladovy a personal me odpalkoval, ze jidlo si jinak kpupit nemuzu:-( | Can't find Prague or Brno as stations after the update. | ""You have no active tickets for which refreshments are available."" This is how I ended up being able to order NOTHING in the course of my WHOLE journey. | Perfect ❤️ | Logs you out, and give incorrect password error even if password is correct | Slow, lot of bugs ... | Nespolahliva aplikacia. Najhorsie je, zd sa cez nu neda objednat catering, na ktory sa clovek spolieha. | Ani po letech vývoj nejsou schopni zajistit chod serveru. Aplikace se při problémech s připojením nechová korektně. Vývoj se nehýbe. | Samovolně odhlašuje | Jednou za čas zkouším, jak se aplikace posunula... Bohužel po pár minutách se pokaždé ****** a sahám po počítači. Nechápu, jak může RJ použití aplikace takové ""kvality"" vynucovat! | the last update made the app unusable, I cant even select a seat... how is this even a thing for a company this big... the last time I used your services you didnt even get us to our destination... is this how you are improving your services now? | Zbytecna aplikace. Vyvojari by meli vratit naklady Regiojetu za tak odflaklou aplikaci. K veci: 2 hodiny nelze objednat jidlo. Potom jde, aplikace se zasekne pri placi aby pri refreshnuti vam ukazala, ze 40 minut pred prijezdem nelze jidlo objednat - k tomu navic aplikace nepripocte zpozdeni, i kdyz aplikace o nem vi. Absolutne zbytecne. | Super aplikácia, lístky, jedlo, cestovné poriadky, všetko v jednom. Mohli by ste prosím pridať objednávanie jedla online, aj pre iné triedy? | Jízda je delší než 40 min, asi hodinu a 5 min, a stejně nejde nic objednat z jídla, protože vlak má 20 min zpoždění, aplikace stále počítá s původním časem příjezdu a objednání se pouští az nějaký čas po odjezdu. Komedie. | Very rarely get served refreshments as they only usually have one person serving the whole train, even though you buy a ticket that offers refreshments. | Unusable, legit one of the worst apps I've ever seen. | Schedules are not loading or it took too much time. And so on... | Při zapnutí jen bílá obrazovka | Aplikace funguje jak má, líbí se mi možnost, že mohu stornovat jízdenku 15 minut před odjezdem. Dobíjení kreditu je jediný problém této aplikace, než se kredity dobíjí trvá to tak 5 minut než se to zobrazí v aplikaci. Tuto aplikaci používám na telefonech, které jsou tak 2 roky staré a na nich to funguje. | This is bug and crash simulator not real application. I was unable to get anything done due to constant crashes and errors. Good job regiojet | Hrozná aplikácia. Jediný dôvod, prečo som si ju stiahol, bolo objednanie občerstvenia. Podľa aplikácie som nemal žiadny platny lístok, a to napriek tomu, že ma steward skontroloval 5 minút dozadu. | The application is slow and buggy. It is better to use RegioJet web instead this app. The web is perfectly fast and everything is working. | Fradulent app! Will pretend to sell you tickets then a different bus with completely different services and brand will take you! | Does not load - only shows white screen. Before that, it was progressively decaying with each update. | Bugs, login page loading too long, outages when ordering and the staff seems to have a real struggles with the orders since it takes much more time than before and the sequence of orders really differentiate. | Nic nefunguje. Už hodinu se snažím objednat kávu, ale z technických důvodů to nejde. A našlo do té doby, kdy už nešlo objednat z důvodu, že by se nestihla příprava do příjezdu do cílové stanice... | IT WAS HORRIBLE! NEVER AGAIN! | I can't use my credit card to buy food on board | Spokojenost, bez problemu funguje. | Very bad experience with this apps It shows us wrong dates of reservation ???? | Helpful, fast, and reliable | One of the worst apps I've ever seen .. bugs everywhere, most time not all purchased tickets shown .. I've started using CD trains and flixbus buses as at least there apps work | Interesting | You can find a surprising amount of info in the app but it is really unintuitive. Half the time it doesn't even show you the tickets and you have to refresh several times to eventually get them. I really don't want to make comparisons between this and the ČD app for example, but they could take some inspiration... edit: For the past few months I have to keep reinstalling the app because it just randomly decides to stop loading anything past the logo. | Often bugs but what is way worse is the train travel itself. It is a new standard that we never leave on time - ""normal"" delay is about 20-40 minutes before we even leave the station... | Excellent App | Booking travel from Prague to Bratislava and from Vienna to Prague was so easy. I am impressed with RegioJet as a company too. The British rail companies could learn a thing or two. | Absolutně nechápu, jak si společnost velikosti Student Agency/RegioJet může dovolit vypustit do produkce aplikaci, ve které funguje polovina funkcí. Tragédie. Regio nikdy víc. | Very bad company and very unprofessional personal. I really dont recommend it | Občas je potřeba aplikaci restartovat, aby se ukázaly objednané jízdenky. Bylo by příjemné, kdyby se informace o tom, že jízdenka je na posilový spoj, zobrazovala už v náhledu jízdenky a ne až po rozbalení detailu. | The worst website and app ever. I am not able to buy tickets for several days and they do not even reply my messages in support. They do not manage who and when buy their tickets and neglext their customers. Wors service, worst trains. Zero. | I'd give -10 if I could. Items are sold out, app never loads or crashes, doesn't let you pay or you end up paying twice... It's been months, and there is ALWAYS something wrong with this system. Now I'm stuck in a train with a 2h delay and I can't order anything because I should have arrived already, and my ticket is no longer valid - absolute disaster of a system 🙃 | Aplikace ukazuje ze je volne misto (pritom to same spojeni vyhledane.na webu je vyprodane) a potom na poslednim kroku hodi error Nelze pridat do kosiku. Po zaplaceni obcerstveni mi apka pise ze nebylo zaplaceno ( nasteti prisel email ze jse ok). | Veľmi oceňujem nový systém objednávania občerstvenia zohľadňujúci aktuálny stav zásob. Sklamala notifikácia, v ktorej čas príjazdu nezohľadňuje meškanie. Ikona upozornenia v stavovej lište je príliš malá, logotyp mohol byť väčší, ľudia, čo nemajú perfektný zrak (alebo hidpi displej) to určite nerozoznajú. Ikony rýchlych skratiek pri podržaní ikony aplikácie majú pri tmavom režime slabý kontrast a nemajú konzistentný vzhľad. Tmavá téma v aplikácii by sa tiež mohla nastaviť zo systému. | Hovadina | Úžasná reakce. Odinstalováno. // 9.6.: Bez reakce. Odinstalovat. // 31.5.: 1. Nutnost objednat si občerstvení přes aplikaci - tedy přes internet - na trati, která má místa bez signálu, to je super kúl vychytávka. 2. Přestože mám povoleny notifikace jen pro ""Možnost o jednávky občerstvení"", otravuje to každou chvíli s nějakým přehledem průběhu jízdy. Achjo. | Zpožděný vlak zmizel ze seznamu zpoždění dřív, než přijel do stanice, tak není možné najít správné nástupiště, objednat si občerstvení v aplikaci trvá 30 minut, nefunguje dokud se nepripojite na jejich WiFi a s její rychlosti trvala jen samotná platba 15 minut, než se načetla. Přesně podle Murphyho, co se pokazit může se pokazí, co nemůže se pokazí taky. | Your app is very slow and also it cannot load any city. The search bar just stays empty. I tried reinstalling the app, and it doesn't work. What a shame | Was an excellent app, however currently I have issues with searching for connections. Only blank white screen opens. Fortunately, at least the web page interface works. | It was great when it worked. But now a black screen appears whenever I do a search | Garbage. Edit: 2 years have passed since my initial review and the app is worse than I remember. | Buying ticket does not work. | White screen when trying to make a search :( | Dlouhodobě strašlivá aplikace, zbytečné klikací kroky po zaplacení (pro které musím do bankovní aplikace na 2FA), kvůli kterým jsem nejednou nastoupil do vlaku bez jízdenky ale s nabitým kreditem... Objednávání jídla mě jednou stálo stovku a do systému obsluhy žádná objednávka nepřišla. Od update 23.5. po vyhledání spoje appka prostě zamrzne s bílou obrazovkou a je potřeba ji vypnout. Nepoužitelné, nerozumím, jak někdo takový produkt může poslat do světa. | Breaks, doesn't load, crashes... used to be good tho | Terrible experience I was going back from Vienna to Prague and they don't give any information about where to find it so I missed it and lost my money never again 👎 | Not working at all. So you gonna stay hungry and you can't do nothing about it! | Apka přestala vyhledávat, zobrazí je jen bila stránka a jediné, co lze udělat, je apku ukončit. I před touto chybkou rozhodně nejde o žádný zázrak, bylo by to tak za 3 hvězdičky. Kdybych do hodnocení zahrnul i samotnou ""offline"" službu, bylo by to horší. Služba se za poslední dobu výrazně zhoršila. | Utter rubbish .. be VERY careful .. if you change timezones, your previously book tickets all change to reflect new timezone, even if they are for travel in old timezone .. App written by utter idiots!!! .. Also many journey are not point to point and have hidden stops and delays .. this company should be closed down!!! | Tak ako viacero komentarov predo mnou...bud appka pise, ze sa neda z technickych pricin objednavat alebo su vsetky polozky vypredane. Stewardky nikde, po vyse dvoch hodinach cesty sa ludia nemaju ako dostat k obcerstveniu 🤷🏼‍♂️ Mame vodu 👍🏻 | I always used this app to book my train from Prague when I return from UK but recently all your timetable when you booking from uk are 1 hour (UK time) behind which doesn't make sence when you try to book train from czech city, only relized this because of you confirmation email....(ei. Trin from Prague at 14.20 shows as train at 13.20??🤔). Maybe something to look at when you do your next update.... | I rate this app at 1 🌟 just because there is no lower option (otherwise I would have rated it at -5 🌟) Completely agree with one of the previous review - this app is useless, completely user not friendly, unnecessary complicated, poor options... Avoid, avoid avoid! | besides the constant delays of the trains and failure stops every hour of the ride, the app doesn't work correctly. The credit I transferred in the app couldn't be used to buy anything. The staff did not know to fix it. | Login wasn't possible, therefore unable to obtain any refreshments during a 5+ hour journey. | Ordering food doesnt work, service here is overworked and they have hard time resolving unexpected situations, take your own food. The app has many bugs , useless.. | Terrible app, nothin is workin properly | crush.. but still smh good. -1 star for incorrect internal timers (when attempting to purchase refreshments it was still 5 minutes before 30 till arrival and the option to purchase them was disabled, the counter also does not take into the account delay!) Very unreliable... | The app feels like pre-alpha to me. I almost starved trying to order refreshments using it. | V poslední době to jde teda hodně dolů. Někdy se aplikace nenačte vůbec, možná je to údržba, což by se dalo chápat, ale to člověk nikde nezjistí, protože na Fb RegioJet nic není. | You can not delete account or change currency 👎 | The idea is great. But the fact that the wifi on the train doesn't properly work most of the train ride ruins the whole concept. Why, just why do I have to use my (unreliable) data to order food when the person responsible is walking past me? | Works fine. I could log in using the number of my ticket, and also order food. The payment went OK, they brought the food in 30 minutes. I like that the app displays how much of which food is available. | Just Perfect. The customer service is a 10/10. When I couldn't find the bus stop in Amsterdam they helped me until the end and the driver was also very patient and friendly. Thank you 😊👏. You guys made my day as I have a long trip ahead🤩 | VÝBĚR SEDADLA PODLE PLÁNKU vs. REALITA: vybírám si sedadlo ve směru jízdy u okna na pravé straně vlaku. Bližší dveře jsou dál od rušně. Nastupuji do vlaku, žádná mimořádnost, a musím projít celým vagonem dopředu a sedím na levé straně vagónu zády do směru jízdy. Koukám do aplikace. Prý sedím vpravo vzadu, ve skutečnosti vlevo vepředu. Děje se to opakovaně na různých tratích. Objednávání občerstvení a nápojů je tak (ne)funkční, že si raději kafe vezmu z čekárny RJ. Opravte prosím v aplikaci. | This app just doesn't work. There has probably been no debugging and pressure to make it work whatsoever. I have used it for like 5 minutes just trying to find my train and look up the prices of tickets and I have already experienced like 4 bugs that happened. Extremly uncomfortable to use. | no possibility to sign in with my Regiojet account | Any attempt to top up credit through the app ends up with some HTML error code so I need to log in through browser to add money / buy ticket. The app doesn't update with departure delays so its already telling me when is the expected arrival even though I haven't left yet. Needs improvement! | Zaplatit za objednávku jídla je naprosto nemožné. Dvakrát jsem skončil na verifikaci, potřetí už to neprošlo ani přes tlačítko zaplatit. Karta ČS. Třešnička nakonec - ""nelze objednat 30min před koncem jízdy"" | Nefunkcna platba kartou (odskusane VISA Tatrabanka, VUB). Nefunkcne doplnenie kreditu cez kartu a ani cez rychly bankovy prevod. Jedlo si neviem objednat tympadom. | Doesn't work properly. I can't see any use for the app since I can't pay for tickets there and I can't open an existing ticket there. Also the train search is intermittent and sometimes just won't work.. What's the point of having an app that does nothing right? | The new notification and refreshment ordering is amazing. So much better then the previous experience. | Trains are good, but this app is a real trash. | Link to payments not working, the first generation worked well, this one sucks on so many levels | I ordered a dish then they made me wait 1,5 hour. When I asked it turned out my payment was stuck in the system. The steward made me pay for it one more time and promised he would ask the responsible ones to return my money... that never happened. So to sum up, don't order, they will cheat you. I am quite pissed. Of course they do not reply to my email I semt to complain. It is very unprofessional | Nice one 👍 | Neskutečně pomalá a těžkopádná aplikace, procházíte spoustou oken a koupě jízdenky pak trvá věčnost. A taky zabírá nesmyslně velké místo na mobilu, v mém případě 646 MB, nechápu proč. Předchozí verze byla rozhodně lepší. | Used to be great. Now won't open after update. Update: it now opens but cannot communicate with my bank. So I cannot actually buy any tickets. But at least I can imagine a journey. | absolute garbage. can't log in, after fifteenth attempts can't order food because while actually seated on your train I apparently don't have a valid ticket. piece of absolute sheit | Nová aplikace podporuje dark mode a vizuálně působí moc hezky, zakoupení jízdenky je snadné a rychlé. Oproti staré aplikaci je to neuvěřitelný pokrok. Snad se brzy podaří přidat i novou verzi portálu s občerstvením. | Beautiful | Tragicky napsaná aplikace. Polovinu času nefunguje a nejde z ní objednat, protože se tváří, že nemáte jízdenku. Když chcete zaplatit přes google pay odkaze vás do prohlížeče, kde to vyhodí akorát error. | Pamatuju verzi appky, kdy byl nákup jednoduchý a rychlý. Teď je to screen za screenem jak seriál na několik večerů. Při srovnání s appkou ČD je nákup pomalý jak želva. Chce to ubrat mezikroky a screeny. | App is broken, sometimes I can't even pay for tickets, even a junior in programming can make it better, we are in 2022 , did you hire monkeys for the it job? | Aplikace se neotevira. Mám Samsung Galaxy S21 ultra, takže pochybuji, že chyba je na moji straně. Přeistalovano, restartovat, problém přetrvává už týden | Perfect working now. Quick action from the team to fix the issue | Android 12 issue solved. Apart from it the app works well, as it's supposed to. Able to buy tickets, view history, order food. | Cannot open app | Aktualizace z 11.1.22 a aplikace neběží vůbec.

Jako divak a poplatnik nemate kde,zanechat verejne hodnoceni. To je chyba nebo mozna zamer | very good. yet please arrange rights in order all archive to be avaliable Europe-wide | Optimalizace by se vždy hodila ale takhle super přehledné | Very good instead of usual TV set | Funguje vcelku dobře, ale jeden zásadní problém tu je. Nelze zvolit zvukovou stopu. A toto nejde nastavit ani v hbbtv aplikaci. Takže tentýž pořad má v mobilu anglickou zvukovou stopu, kdežto v televizi českou. | Příjemné UX/UI, aplikace je krásně responsivní a svižná, vývojová společnost, narozdíl od ostatních (ehm ehm O2), ví co dělá a je to znát. | Dobře zpracovaná aplikace, přehledná a je zde opravdu na co koukat! 😀 Vřele doporučuji | Seriály a všecko super, ale proč tak dlouho trvá načítání pořadů? A mým internetem to opravdu není, jelikož to nenačte ani mobilní 4G😆 | Very best mix of programs. But please make all possible and impossible to offer archive programs of CT to the world outside Czech Republic at least in EU. | Sleduji Události přes aplikaci ale poslední dobou už nejde se podívat jen na vybrané reportáže. Musíte si to pustit celé a případně odhadem přeskakovat pokud se chcete dostat na něco konkrétního. | registration keeps failing | Neustále bufferuje bez ohledu na zvolenou kvalitu.

Mám ji opravdu rád. | živé vysílání nejde streamovat do Chromecast zařízení. | ynot abe to move within app. badly design app. wasted public money by management of czech tv | Apka je vcelku super, jen mě štve, že si nepamatuje připojenou televizi přes Google Cast a musím ji znovu nastavovat pro každý pořad, který pouštím. Nejvíc to vadí u seriálů. | Neda se skrolovat pri pouziti dalkoveho ovladani ani pres bluetooth klavesnici kdyz to mam na android TV.... Proc bych to psal kdyby to neslo?! Vsechny ostatni appky funguji jak s dalkacem i s klavesnici. | Thank you. This app is what i need | I wanted to watch the president duel but the app won't let me.

We brought our TV from the USA and we weren't able to connect the TV cable to it so we couldn't watch Czech TV, but now we can. | App is now available for SMART TV as well. Happy to use it in phone as well as in TV. | wish I could download | Problems with Android TV/Box , mouse and scroll not suported, remote control doesnt work as well. | Mohu poprosit o featuru ohledně zvuku. V mém zařízení je slyšet zvuk pouze když je puštěn jako ""speaker"". Ocenil bych, kdyby byla možnost pustit ""pouze zvuk"" jako speaker | Aplikace konečně vypadá jak z tohoto století, díky za to. Ještě je potřeba do přehrávače přidat přepnutí na landscape mode. | Fine overall, but tablet layout lacks the three-dot icon with back in time and audio-only options. Please fix (or better bring back in time function to the player itself as on web and hbbtv). | Ocenil bych možnost přepínání audio stopy u vícejazyčných pořadů. Např. Hyde Park Civilizace neumožňuje přehrání v originálním znění v případě zahraničního hosta. Jinak dobrá aplikace. | ""Pouze zvuk"" je k dispozici od verze 3.0.2 | Chromecast se mi podařilo připojit jednou a poté už ne. Na TV vidím pouze logo České televize, aplikace mi hlásí, že streamuje, ale video jede pouze na telefonu. U všech ostatních aplikaci Chromecast funguje na jedničku. Ale aspoň se neseká co pět vteřin jako webové iVysílání. | Funkční ale zoufale nevybavené. Určitě byse hodila možnost nastavení hlasitosti a jasu přimo z přehrávaneho videa. Tmavší filmy jsou nekoukatelné. | Na TV boxe s Android-om 7.1.2 nefunguje v aplikacii posuvanie, teda scrolling obrazovky. Takto nie je absolutne mozne si pozriet inu ako 1. cast nejakeho serialu al. dokumentu. K dalsim castiam sa totiz neda nijak teraz dostat takze aplikacia je v tejto novej verzii nepouzitelna! Stara apka fungovala. Dakujem za opravu tohoto neprijemneho problemu. | hruza | Příšerná aplikace, není možné vybrat rozlišení videa, nelze přehrávat pouze zvuk, rozhraní aplikace je možné používat pouze na výšku atd atd.... Zatím nic moc teda. | Už jen umožnit stahování pořadů a bude to bezchybné. 4/5 | Apka mi schodi video prehravač pro všechny ostatní aplikace, pokud selže přehrávání v Čt app, potom už nejde ani YouTube nebo podobné apky. Pomůže jen restart telefonu. | Nechápu proč ČT (za peníze koncesionářů a daňových poplatníků) hodila z okna fungující aplikace a přišla s novými co se musí ještě dlouho ""postupně vylepšovat"" aby vůbec fungovaly. Přehrávání nefunguje jak má, ergonomie je jen cizí slovo, hledání v programu nefunguje, případně mi to nabízí seznam pořadů pěkně už od roku 2008, ... to ani nemluvím o aplikacích pro ČT sport atd. Někdo si na tom sakra dobře namastil kapsy (malá domů za pár mega, co) ale použitelné to moc není a asi dlouho nebude. | Aplikace umí pouze přehrávat obsah. Ocenil bych další funkce jako třeba uložení pořadu/dílu do oblíbených, zobrazení pořadů na mapě atd. | používám aplikaci na média box kde je k dispozici pouze klávesnice a myš. bohužel po posledním ""velkým"" updatu není možné aplikaci používat jelikož neodporuje myš a není možno navigovat ani klávesnici. | Nová aplikace v mém případě vůbec nefunguje,tedy videa po spuštění play vůbec nehrají,a to ani živé vysílání ani ze záznamu....jen černá obrazovka | After the update you can only use the video player.. The app is therefore almost useless because you can start the video player from any browser from your website.. Why would I need an app for that? The benefit of the app was that you could only listen to audio with your screen off.. By taking away this possibility, you have made the app useless.. | Prosím, ať je apka k dispozici i pro zařízení Google TV. Edit: na mobilu fajn, jen když ji pouštím naležato (třeba v držáku, nebo na stole), tak se to asi 3x přetočí tam a zpět (s mobilem nehýbám). Chtělo by to veškeré obrazovky mít pro oba režimy (portrét, naležato). | 1. Při přehrávání videa jsou po stranách rušivé modré plochy, kterými aplikace vyplňuje nevyužitý prostor, což je obzvlášť nepříjemné u tmavých scén. 2. Absence oblíbených pořadů. 3. Absence nastavení konkrétní kvality videa. 4. Absence nastavení jasu a hlasitosti. 5. Absence automatického překlopení na šířku v případě, kdy má telefon deaktivované automatické otáčení, což v původní verzi fungovalo. 6. Absence funkce zoom, aby video využilo celou plochu displeje. | U can't choose quality/bitrate of stream, there is no ""audio only"" option for ČT24, so no control over data usage - therefore for me almost unusable. | Takhle to dopadá když design ui dementi a projektový imbecil zvítězí nad racionálním uvažování. Startovací verze? Ksindl jak si někdo dovolí vypustit mezi lidi aplikaci bez funkcí z veřejných peněz. Ksindl neskutečný, usilovně pracujete? Běžte d o p r del e šmejdi (chybí moje pořady, v seznamu dílů není datum vydanit dílů atd,) nemusíte ani odpovídat nějakou trapnou odpovědí, hodnocení vyšší nikdy nebude, chování zm e tk ů | Není tam možnost uložit si mezi oblíbené. | Vyborně! | Takhle zmastit fungujici aplikaci...vratte radsi starou verzi. Vzdyt to vubec nefunguje, nejde scrollovat, seka se to. proste fuj | Aktualizaci 2.0.0 mám instalovanou jen několik hodin ale jsem nadšený. Zlepšení je markantní! Konečně všechno funguje jak má. | Nice | super | Aplikace funguje, ale chybí klíčova vlastnost picture-in-picture. | Nefunguje, ostuda. To programoval imbecil. | Dnes nefunguje vůbec. Jen se točí a točí. A dnes, 18. 1. 2021 nefunguje chromecast, jen se točí a točí a pak už nic. Děkuji za obnovení Chromecastu! Dnes 4. 2., nelze spustit aplikaci vůbec, není funkční ani HbbTV, ale možná je chyba na našich telefonech, televizích, tabletě a počítačích a nebo vodafone sítích. | Tak už zase nefunguje přehrávání na chromecast. Že by chyba někde na backendu? | Nefunguje streaming do Chromecast. Plánujete opravdu? | Dobrý den, bylo by možné rozdělit díly u seriálu na jednotlivé série? Možná je problém jen u mě, ale např. u seriálu Vyprávěj vidím všechny díly naházené do jednoho seznamu (navíc bez číslování), takže se v tom opravdu nedá vyznat. Jinak Chromecast funguje skvěle a v podstatě nemám co vytknout, aplikace se mi líbí. Děkuji. PS: Dočítám se v dalších recenzích, že se snad chystá nová mobilní a i TELEVIZNÍ aplikace? Cool! 😎 | Seká se obraz na Anddroid 11, Lenovo P11 Pro. Evidentně problém kodeku. Wifi 80Mb je v pořádku. Ostatní apky (eurosport, netflix, hbo go, youtube) jsou v pořádku. Udělejte s tím něco, nedá se na to koukat. | Při volbě přehrávání pouze audia vždy po několika minutách přehrávání selže. | Opět snižuji hodnocení na jednu hvězdičku. Stream se přerušuje zhruba co půl hodiny, nedokáže navázat, a teď pro jistotu přestal casting fungovat úplně. Kde můžu zrušit ty vaše idiotské koncesionářské poplatky? | nejsou titulky | Perfektní aplikace. Vše funguje jak má. Vyhledám z téměř nekonečného seznamu pořadů a přes Chromecast odešlu do televize. Je to rychlejší a pohodlnější než přes červené tlačítko v samotné televizi. Díky ČT! A námět pro další vývoj vidím ve vyhledávání v názvech pořadů pomocí tři prvních písmen. Dostupných pořadů je tolik, že první dvě písmena na to nestačí. | Hned jak jsem si appku stahla tak ji zase odinstaluji. Pri hledani dilu serialu mi to stale laguje a vraci se to na puvod stranku. Je mnohem jednodussi si to pustit na webu. | masakr, neustale se seka na chromecastu (tak 1-2x za minutu) je to tak otravne a skoro nekoukatelne, neni to netem, netflix, youtube se nesekne ani jednou, hnus | Pro změnu živé přehrávání nefunguje... | Byla by super podpora Android TV | Bude někdy verze pro Android TV? | Don't knoey | Aplikace při přehrávání pořadu - konkrétně Objektiv z 21.2.2021, opakovaně přehrávání zastavuje a točí se načítání. Stejný problém se objevil i u jiných pořadů. Pořad sleduji přes Chromecast na TV. V minulosti to fungovalo, nyní zlobí. Chromecast 2 | Na Samsung Tab S7+ hlásí, že se nemůže připojit s serveru. Reinstal nepomohl.... | Does not work at all | Je tam dobrá snaha, ale dokonalé to není. Overlay tlačítek nemusí být tak tmavý a jeho timeout může být poloviční. Uživatel to zvládne. | U živého vysílání a při přehrávání většiny videí dostanu jen oznámení: ""Litujeme, tento obsah není kvůli omezeným autorským právům dostupný na vašem území"". Vím ovšem že je možné zpřístupnit tv ze zahraničí lidem s trvalým pobytem v České republice. Stačí ověřit totožnost a přihlásit se. Prosím zapracujte na tom. Krom toho Evropskou unii nepovažuji za zahraničí. | Padá audio ct24, android 9 i 10. | skvela apka, ale od posledniho updatu (spis androidu) nejde obraz u zadneho streamu ČT (tablet lenovo..) please fix | proc je update na verzi 1.9.3 driv v huawei app galerii a tady v google play stale neni? | Po zapnuti videa aplikace dlouho nacita a pak vzdy spadne. Nefunguje. | Poorly designed and programmed, quite a lot of flaws, sometimes it just can’t even run...waste of money for ČT | Pravdepodobne je to ucel, ale stve me, ze pripadny screenshot je vycerneny | Vse se nacita prilis dlouho, nelze nijak filtrovat a neni oznaceny obsah, ktery nelze prehrat. ""Film/serialy.. "" neni zanr. Chybi jakykoliv popisek u videi jako zanr, reziser, herci, rok vzniku, zeme puvodu atd. Naprosto nepouzitelna aplikace, ktera vypada jak nedokonceny amatersky projekt. | Velmi nespolehliva aplikace | Nejspíši super kdyby šlo nechat běžet přehrávání na pozadí a / nebo v plovoucím okně. S přehráváním pouze v režimu celé obrazovky pro mě nepoužitelné. | Stream zive se zasekava po kazdych 15 minutach. | Aplikace už je několik let v podstatě stejná, možná by stálo za úvahu redesignovat. Když hledám něco, co v iVysílání není, neukáže se mi nic. Očekával bych alespoň nějakou hlášku typu ""Tohle tady není"". Fajn by bylo zobrazování částí pořadů (např. V Událostech oddělit na timeline jednotlivé reportáže formou kapitol - jako je to na webu). Celá aplikace je na výšku, přehrávání je na šířku - mělo by se umožnit používat aplikaci v obou rozvrženích. Pořady 4:3 jsou roztaženy na 16:9. | Permanentne prerusuje stream, nie je mozne ani 10 minut pozerat v kuse. Po preruseni vysielania casto nie je mozne pokracovat. | Live video freezing every 2-3 munutes | Za tohle platím? | Does not run chyba pripojeni k serveru | K nicemu. Nefunguje na sirku, ale pouze na vysku! / Useless app. Doesn't work in landscape mode. Only portrait mode is available! | Aplikace není podporována na FireOS | Chybi podpora pro Chromecast | Prehravani se obcas prerusi.

To jak je to ted, je velmi uzivatelsky neprivetive. | chyba v prehravani (samsung android 9). nefunguje zive ani ze zaznamu... drive fungovalo. | Proč není aplikace pro android TV ? | Už bylo na čase. Funguje to báječně. Staré chyby jsou již opravené. Jsem závislý na vysílání ČT když jsem dlouhodobě v zahraničí... Výběr programů a nahrané pořady pomalu roste. Některé pořady jsou zablokované bohužel kvůli autorským právům mimo území Česka. | Aplikace pri vysilani skrz chromecast pada. U samsungu s9 se ani neotevre. | Při sledování živého vysílání stream pravidelně každých cca. 10 - 15 minut havaruje - zčerná obrazovka a vypadne zvuk. Je nutno se vrátit zpět do seznamu kanálů a spustit znovu. Děje se bez ohledu na rozlišení. Při sledování z archivu se problém nevyskytuje. Telefon Asus Zenfone 6, aktuální Android 10. | Vidím aplikaci, říkám si, hurá, můžu sledovat Českou TV z ciziny, pak přišlo zklamání, buď chybová hláška nebo ""litujeme, tento obsah není kvůli omezeným autorským právům dostupný na vašem území"" ...tak to odinstaluju, sbohem | Uprostřed vysílání se mně přehrávání seklo a hotovo. Stejně se mně zdají ty servery líné v porovnání s Youtube, O2 TV nebo Kuki TV. ČT je nejdražší placená TV. | Nejsem si jista, ze jste odstranili chybu v prehravani. At se snazim jak se snazim. Videa mi prehrat nelze. | Chromecast funguje jen pri streemu poradu z archivu, live nefunguje | Chromecast doesn't work! | Po aktualizaci aplikace, přestalo fungovat sdílení na Chromecast, ale vývojářům se to podařilo opravit. | Chromecast streaming stop working. Pls fix. | The Chromecast casting is broken, probably from latest update | Jak je možné že do ČT teče každý rok 7 miliard (možná trochu méně či více) a za celou dobu nikdo nedokáže zprovoznit alespoň jak se říká u politiků alespoň trochu ""důstojnou"" aplikaci pro Android či iPhone? | Aplikace po aktualizaci nepřehraje žádné video, respektive hned skočí nakonec. Vymazání dat pomohlo, ale s tím se nepřekvapivě smazaly i moje pořady 😕 jak píší ostatní, chromecast též nefunguje a intenzivní práce na opravě snad nemůže trvat dva týdny. | Spokojenost | Od posledni aktualizace nejde spustit zadny porad. Ano, u poradu z archivu se prehraje reklama a potom se zobrazi pouze nefunkcni 'tlacitko' ""Prehrat znova"" na cernem pozadi. Pri spusteni online vysilani v realnem case pouze rovnou nefunkcni 'tlacitko' ""Play livestream"" na cernem pozadi (zarizeni nastaveno na jazyk EN). UPDATE: Po preinstalaci funguje jako drive, 4*. | Po posledni aktualizaci nejdou prehravat zadna videa. Ani odninstalovani a opetovne nainstalovani nepomohlo. 😏 | Přestalo fungovat přehrávání přes Chromecast, ostatní aplikace problém nemají, tzn.chyba je v iVysílání | Po poslednim update se spusti jen reklama a pozadovane video pak uz ne. Minimalne u ""Udalosti"" tento stav trva uz nekolik dni. | Aplikace přestala zcela komunikovat s google chromecast a zlobí i při přehrávání. Hlavně, že se v ní objevily reklamy před videem. | Po poslední aktualizaci nejsem schopný sledovat žádný pořad, vidím jen černou obrazovku a tlačítko Přehrát znovu. Na druhém mobilu (stejný model) přehrávání videí funguje, ale nejde streamovat na Chromecast. | Po poslední aktualizaci se přehrají reklamy na začátku a pořad skočí rovnou na konec a zeptá se jestli chci přehrát pořad znovu. Ano chci, reklama a jedeme dokola. Děkuji za přehrávač jedné reklamy... | Kde je Interview s V. Láskou 26.9.? | Nefunguje: ""Nepodarilo se prehrat"" na vse. Bez jakehokoliv vysvetleni. | Sranec Nefunguje | totalne nepouzitelny, aplikace spadne vzdy pri kliknuti na Dalsi dily. Nefunguje vyhledavani podle datumu - tvari se ze se nacetl vybrany den, ale program je porad stejny. Pri rozkliknuti dalsiho dilu v nejakem serialu z programu se prehrava ten samy, testoivano na Nemocnicnii na kraji mesta | Everything just shows ""not available in your country"". What was that about geoblocking in EU being illegal? Being abroad was the only reason I installed the app. | Port 554 forwardovaný nemám, jak bych taky mohl mít, když mám doma 3 smartphony a tři počítače. Přesto to manželce na archaickém HTC Desire na androidu 2.3 funguje. Mě nikdy nefungovalo na těchto telefonech: HTC Legend, HTC Wildfire, HTC Desire s ICS 4.0. Nyní mi to zázrakem funguje na Nexus S s Androidem 4.2, ale nefunguje na ZTE Blade. Jak to, že to na Windows PC vždycky funguje, i když není forwardovaný port? | Aplikace spadne, kdykoli uživatel zvolí režim Pouze zvuk. Takto se to chová už dlouho. Užívám Android 8.0 a 8.1... | oki | Přestala fungovat funkcionalita ""Živě"" - objeví se jen černá/tmavá plocha. Nepoužitelné. Opravte prosím! | Chromecast obrazovka potřebuje tlačítka na posun vzad a vpřed o 10s!! | Aplikace konečně podporuje Chromecast, což je skvělý krok kupředu. Nicméně stále postrádám jednoduchý management oblíbených seriálů, rozdělení sérií nebo jasný přehled toho, co už jsem viděl (případně na kolikáté minutě skončil). Stále je co dohánět v porovnání s aplikacemi HBO, Netflix nebo Prime Video, ale krok kupředu je znát a je příjemný. Díky !!! | Není možné přehrávání pozastavit nebo přejít na jinou pozici. V takovém případě se přehrávání už znovu nerozbehne a musím ho pustit znovu od začátku. To dělá aplikaci téměř nepoužitelnou.(Lenovo p70a v4.4.4 KitKat) | Nedokáže seřadit díly podle času vysílání. | No need for TV with this app ♥️ | Mimo ČR nelze spustit téměř nic. Opět nenažraná a neschopna zřídit uživatelské účty - Česka televize! | Jsem v Canade a zkousel jsem Vas app, ale nefunguje autorske zamezeni.

Zoufalost... | to je skvele ze ct pridala zive vysilani ale pri spusteni libovolneho poradu aplikace okamzite pada.... k nicemu! | Konečně chromecast. | K čemu to živé vysílání je, když se nemůžu na ČT1 podívat ani na hlavni zpravodajskou relaci v 19:00? Odinstalace. | Konečně redesingn.... Nějak nechápu funkci fullscreen a její praktičnost ... Chybí propojení s účtem na webu ... Chybí ukládání postupu u pořadů | Konečně podporuje chromecast | Jedna hvezda za to, ze to kdysi slo spustit na chvili ... | Nefunguje zvuk | Chybí podpora pro Chromecast | Bez Chromecastu, co je smysl? | Great | Super, že aplikace vůbec existuje! Chybí filtr pořadů dostupných pro přehrávání. Chybí základní textový popis o pořadu - o čem ten který pořad (video) je.  Edit: Neexistuje fulltext vyhledávání, nelze přehrát pořady z olympiády,...za půl roku stále stejné tragické UI i ovládání. | Tragická aplikace!!! Nestabilní, nespolehlivá a uživatelsky zcela nepřívětivá. Udělejte s tím něco!!!! | Pořady o olympiádě nejdou přehrát, prý se nepodařilo připojit k serveru. Přitom žádný request ani nebyl proveden. Navíc archivní pořady ale přehrát jdou, takže problém bude někde jinde.  Dnes už standardní podpora Chromecastu chybí - v televizi si sice můžu pustit živé živé vysílání, ale někdy si chci něco přehrát z archivu - proč to nenabídnout?  UX/UI by zasloužilo přepracovat, aplikace je na androidu, tak podle toho má vypadat. Standardní elementy, způsob navigace atd. Proč to psát od nuly, když existují zavedené, osvědčené způsoby? | Chybí podpora Chromecast, to je ovšem dost možná záměr. UI je příšerné - aplikace pro android bez Google Material Design - to je snad jen recese. Chybí popis jednotlivých videí - není vubec jasné jestli dané video je seriál, večerníček, nebo zprávy. Karta ""související"" vypisuje prapodivné výsledky | Kedy bude podpora Chromecastu? | Vypsani seznamu programu a najdeni poradu co chci chce pevne nervy a dost casu. Nejspis nevhodne implementovano, nedoreseno, neoptimalizovano. | poslední update je prů*** - vždyť se to vůbec nevejde na obrazovku a tlačítka pro přidání do oblíbených, výběr předchozích dílů.. nejsou dostupná  ??? (S7/S8+ HD/FHD i WQHD)  missing Multi-Window Support :( Např. na S7 jdou aplikace (YouTube atd.) zmenšit do malého on-top okna, takže mohou běžet zároveň s navigací, nebo při libovolné jiné aktivitě - což u TV je samozřejmě velmi zajímavá vlastnost. | Does not support Chromecast (or smart TVs). | To se mi libi | Dobrý, ale bez chromecast je to jen znouzectnost. | To je ale nepovedena aplikace... | Dostupnost pořadu se divák dozví teprve poté, když se ho pokusí přehrát. To je asi česká specialita. Proč nemůže být v menu jenom to, co je aktuálně dostupné? | Chybí podpora pro Chromecast | Nový přehrávač stále není dotažený do konce. Nedostatky: 1) Při prohlížení programů vysílaných na jednotlivých stanicích během dne se scrolluje vždy jen sloupeček jednoho kanálu, což je velmi nefektivní/otravné. 2) Přechod na datum pořadu z kalendáře nefunguje správně (sobota 14. ledna 2017 se zobrazuje jako 13. leden). Po vybrání data (sobota 13. ledna) se neaktualizuje horizontální výpis dat v týdnu a není vidět správný program pro tento den. 3) Videa se ihned po vstupu na detail pořadu spouštějí (zbytečně mi zatěžuje data, když se chci jen podívat na detaily pořadu). 4) Obtížně se přetáčí vpřed a vzad (vlivem nepřesnosti dotyku nejsem schopen udělat prstem přesné krátké přetočení; horší u delších videí). | Promeskana prilezitost. Zastarale UI a zadna Chromecast​ podpora | Zastaralé UI a video se dá přetáčet jen když se aplikaci chce. | nebetycny paskvil. nepouzitelne, odinstalovano po minute. | Bude nekdy podporovat chromecast? | Hrozně vypadá, ještě hůře se ovládá a chybí základní funkce. A taky podpora pro Chromecast. Příšerný zmetek. | chyba podpora pre chromecast | Chromecast by tuhle aplikaci přineslo na úplně jinou úroveň | Prosim o podporu chromecast | Podpora chromcast chybí proto jen 4 hvězdy | chybí mi podpora chromecastu 🤔 | Aplikace je uzivatelsky mnohem prijemnejsi na pouzivani nez ostatni ct aplikace, skoda, ze chybi chromecast. | Nefunguje s Chromecast | Lze volit programy, zastavovat a spouštět, seek - posunutí taky funguje a změna kvality videa rovněž. Zatím spokojenost. | Nefunguje, nepřehrává video ani po aktualizaci. Funguje mi pouze prohlížeč s flashem na přehrávání obsahu z iVysilani. Ostuda ČT? Řekl bych, že ano! | Rubbish | Soustavné padání streamu, které způsobuje absolutní nepoužitelnost aplikace. | Po půl roce to konečně funguje normálně . | pridala som si viac programov do oblubenych, aby som si ich neskor pozrela a appka zacala padat. otvorim, idem do oblubenych, zacnu sa nacitavat a okamzite to padne. ocenila by som aj moznost niekde oznacit oblubenu relaciu, nie iba diely. | Skvely obsah, ktery nelze vysilat do TV pres Chromecast, tak jako u spousty konkurencnich aplikaci. Na co tedy je??? | Nechapu proc to nefunguje v zahranici | Poslední update konečně umožňuje přehrávat video bez zasekávání. | Super, funguje skvele, jen pridejte podporu Chromecast | Od poslední aktualizace se obraz už jen seká, nelze nic sledovat. Škoda že si to neumí načíst dopředu a pak spustit... | Good appka | neustale pada | Dobra applikace, jenom je skoda, ze v zahrani ci nejde prehrat spoustu programu. | A take je mezi prvky chybne definovan focus. Celkove ma aplikace spoustu vad. | prosim vyuzijtech funkce Chromecast!! | Nejde zvuk. Obraz je zrychlený. | Pořádně nefunguje takřka na všech platformách.  Neustále vypadává video, zvuk, chybí smysluplný seeking s náhledy.  Takhle vážně ne. | Aplikace je super, i když má své mouchy. Problém se zvukem jsem nikdy neměl. Jediné, co mi vadí, je uvádění pořadů, které stejně nelze přehrát, v nabídce. A nelze nainstalovat na Android TV (funguje pouze hack přes funkci HbbTV). | Nefunguje lenovo yoga 2 | Proc se proste o sve aplikace Cesi neumi starat?! To stejne casopis Apetit a dalsi (vyjimka Respekt a Headliner)!!! Ocekavala bych, ze aplikace bude mit castejsi updaty a nekdo se o ni bide starat, snad?! Pro me velke zklamani :( | Chybi podpora Chromecastu | Aplikace se taky nedovede vypořádat s vypršením licence pro internetové vysílání, pořad my v ""moje"" visí a všude je null | Nejde zvuk :-( | Problemy so zvukom na Nexus 6 Android 5.1.1. Treba si v nastaveniach aplikacie zmenit HTTP stream na RTSP stream a potom ide vsetko dobre. Doplnene: video sa vzdy po par minutach sekne.

Download the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life!

The secret path to language learning
Remember the language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely say “Hello!” to a foreigner. Mondly’s approach is different from the average language course.

The future of language courses
The app gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end you will reconstruct the conversation with your voice. Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

The key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors 
Learn pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

State-of-the-art Speech Recognition 
Mondly listens as you pronounce words and phrases. You will get positive feedback if you speak clearly and correctly.

Useful phrases for real situations 
Memorizing isolated words is not the way to learn a language. Mondly teaches you vocabulary through core words and phrases. It breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

Learn from conversations 
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs.

Verb conjugations 
Learn more from this course. Tap the verbs and get the full conjugation, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

Advanced Statistics 
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better.

The Leaderboard 
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner.

Adaptive Learning 
People learn differently. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. Mondly will become your own guide and customized teacher.

At the end of these language lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases, getting you on the fast lane to learning a new language!","Learn Spanish 🇪🇸🇲🇽, English 🇬🇧, French 🇫🇷, German 🇩🇪, Portuguese 🇵🇹🇧🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Russian 🇷🇺, American English 🇺🇸, Norwegian 🇳🇴, Danish 🇩🇰, Dutch 🇳🇱, Swedish 🇸🇪, Korean 🇰🇷, Japanese 🇯🇵, Chinese 🇨🇳, Arabic, Greek 🇬🇷, Romanian 🇷🇴, Vietnamese 🇻🇳, Indonesian 🇮🇩, Hindi 🇮🇳, Hebrew 🇮🇱, Polish 🇵🇱, Bulgarian 🇧🇬, Ukrainian 🇺🇦, Hungarian 🇭🇺, Czech 🇨🇿, Croatian 🇭🇷, Finnish 🇫🇮, Persian (Farsi), Afrikaans, Thai 🇹🇭, Turkish 🇹🇷, Bengali 🇧🇩, Catalan, Latin, Latvian 🇱🇻, Lithuanian 🇱🇹, Slovak 🇸🇰, Tagalog 🇵🇭 and Urdu 🇵🇰 <b>for free.</b><br><br><b>Learn languages</b> with free lessons daily with Mondly.

I will tell to my other friends to download this app also | The vocabulary part is good, and so as the interface, but due to the crazy jumps in grammatical levels, it's not advised for beginners. I used it for Polish. | Top | Now the app is real broken! Points from completing lessons are not being added to my monthly score since 21st March 2024 in all languages! You need to fix it now! The app steals money from you by tricking you into subscription at a click of a button every time you use it! | платное | Love this app ❤❤❤I suggest it for beginners | I love it but I don't like subscriptions so it's very limited for me . Don't know how long I will keep it up as eventually it will stop | Great app wowww I can't believe I already know some words in less than an hour | This is boring....a japanese lesson- you dont teach us how to read kanji but you start a lesson with kanji. DUOLINGO IS MUCH BETTER. | Could be a bit more thorough and less sporadic. I would like to learn the oarsman alphabet but I don't think imthis app will feature that | It is one of the best apps for learning any languages that you want and one good news for Iranian is that this app supports Persian. | Mic isn't working.

Enough said. | Actual customer service! I had an issue recovering my account after transferring to a new device, emailed the company, and within a day it was resolved easily and completely. Thanks! | The lessons are simple yet effective. I've learned more in 5 days using this than in high school. I like it so much I've signed up for a yearly subscription! 03/22 ì still love Mondly, however when I try to repeat back to it during a lesson, it often doesn't give mè enough time to speak! I am a ventilator-dependent woman and have to wait on a push air to talk. Is there any way to give me more time to respond? Also, it doesn't always hear my correct responses either, any tips? Me gustan Mondly!! | very good and easy to learn | Sehr gut | Muito bem | ผมชอบแอบนี้. มันใช้งานง่าย. | I like it.. its very useful | thank you | Like it | Good | Super | Nice teaching laguage app | Who ever made this app is a genius.this may be due to multiple classified reasons. But still the best | Membuat saya semangat belajar | It will be great if each highlighted word or selected word inputs, are individually pronounced as they are clicked or selected, it will greatly improve learning and word registering in the brain, also the AI speech recognition requires improvement, in the area of sensitivity and overall performance. The GUI & the verb structuring in the past-present-future tenses is super great other core grammatical syntax guidance, will be nice. But this is a great app and can speed up new language learning, | I can't recommend this App. First off, the conversation training at the end of each training sounds like a great idea, until you realize that it doesn't actually evaluate whether what you said is correct. It just plays back the recording blindly. In addition, this app causes an ungodly amount of spam. Constant notifications, and daily spam emails with reminders that you cannot unsubscribe from. I have unticked all boxes in ""Email preferences"" and it just won't stop´. Unsubscribed. | It's amazing app 😘😘😘😘😘 | Perfect | Like it very much..I would like to try it more before subscribing | Nice app. I like this app | Usefull | very good app | Good | Perfect app | Easy to use. The speed and pronunciation of the bot is excellent. | Top | Thank you app developer | It's good | It's very interesting | Very helpful | Very useful app | Really enjoying using the app, it's easy to do a little everyday and I can feel myself learning a lot, especially learning to read and spell as well as pronunciation of words. The area that the app is lacking is learning to speak the language as in each lesson only one part is conversation and it doesn't really check that you say everything correctly and it's hard to go back and try again. Please make the conversation work more like the ""chat bot"" where it checks pronunciation. PLEASE 🙏 🙏 🙏 | The app it îs useless because they ask for money. Better I pay a teacher of English that to pay an app! I don't recomand those kinds of apps that asks for money, I mean all apps that ask for money!!!!!! | This app is so poor - on the 20th of March 2024 they don't even have a special Norouz lesson. | For now it was perfect, grazie | Very helpful | Great app | This is great 👍 i love it | My experience in this apps isnice because I learn the languages so I rate 4 star | It is very good❤️this app makes us to understand different languages easily. | Simple learning and attractives | It it really easy to learn with even without any tutor🥰❤❤ | Very good app | Really appreciating | Sehr gut | Switched from Duolingo because I stopped getting anything from Duo.

Now I'm trying to get to their customer service and it says I'm over 186436 in line ? If I don't get any response within 24 hrs I will report this fraud to Google playstore as well as my bank | This app helped me a lot | Paid app and not worth | since there is no Serbian language, as a possibility, the grades are lower because it does not accept words from Serbian, but only Croatian translations. you could make a program that accepts both variants. | Very best app for learning | Am raportat un bug in urma cu aproape jumate de an și tot nu s-a rezolvat.

I've been learning Afrikaans and Modly has made it very simple for ur beginners 😊 | Very good | Good repitition, choice of Arabic or English script.

No review or instruction prior to the lesson. No vocabulary you can study. Do you no how to say and spell ""appointment"" in Farsi? I didn't but the app just tossed it out there. Don't try to point this out to customer service. They will give you an assignment such as: send us a video. That's after I sent them a screenshot. Don't pay for the premium version. | I love it | Very helpful | ❣️💯💯💯 | It helps me to learn and pronounce many vocabularies. | Very good | Excellent! | Seems easy to learn but expensive | Excelent | Very easy to use and understand | Sehr gut | So good | Good for vocabulary learning and practice. | I have switched after many years from the owl app and I must say Mondly suits me better. As of today, the Total Hours from daily lessons funny add up, but the support was fast and helpful and forwarded further. The daily lessons could be more variable, there's simply ""too much taxi"" 😅 | very cool | It's ok ig | Easy to use.

The app finally has speed to it (except when tapping on words to fill them in), and progresses automatically. I love that you listen to users. The content is still a bit wonky and inconsistent at times though, but keep it up."",""I've already deleted this app, which I stack to for more than a month to give it a chance. It's definitely not free, actually the free content is incredibly limited. The biggest flaw I've found in all the offered languages(I've tried them all) is that there are far too many both grammatical and lexical mistakes. I got to the conclusion that most of the content is created by the simple use of the Google Translate. No grammar and completely different translation of English and the goal language."",""I bought this language app because of the variety of languages and the great deal for a lifetime membership. While I am learning some from using it daily, there is definitely room for improvement. Positive: it has categories, such as hotels, restaurants, and more, so you can tailor your learning. Negative:Daily lessons often use random sentences that nobody will use. I have been told how to say the mouse is small several times! Better content needed! Explain grammar a little."",""I can't recommend this App. First off, the conversation training at the end of each training sounds like a great idea, until you realize that it doesn't actually evaluate whether what you said is correct. It just plays back the recording blindly. In addition, this app causes an ungodly amount of spam. Constant notifications, and daily spam emails with reminders that you cannot unsubscribe from. I have unticked all boxes in \""Email preferences\"" and it just won't stop´. Unsubscribed."",""Attractive UI but the user experience is imperfect. Has nice mode where I can converse hands free, yet it never hears single words. When tapping on my phone is required, Mondly often leaves a lot of blank space between the words to be selected and the continue button at the screen bottom. On larger phones this makes the experience less enjoyable. Also, it is really easy to accidentally redo a lesson because the new lesson isn't highlighted and the lesson just completed remains center screen.""]",false,false,false,"com.atistudios.mondly.languages","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atistudios.mondly.languages&hl=en&gl=CZ"

It facilitates pertinent discussions without the unnecessary clutter that plagues other platforms. | Not working why....? | The app barely works anymore. Awful | The amount of racism, open transphobia, and hatred that's been spread has been increased exponentially since Elon Musk purchased Twitter. He has done nothing good for the app, and it should be taken from him by someone who knows how to run a website. | جميل جدا والله العظيم | I am trying to login my account but last few days its not accesing | I vote for Musk..all the way.. | Got permanently suspended for breaking the rules without ever posting anything and support won't even tell me what rules were broken | Great 👍🏻 👌 👍🏻 | Why is the selection of the phone code of Ukraine unavailable to register, change the number or restore access to accounts? Meanwhile, the russian telephone code remains available. What kind of hypocrisy is this? | Fighting disinformation with information. Excellent app | X continues to take the app that was once great (known as Twitter) and lower it to new depths. Bots, spam, and hate speech are daily life here now when the app actually loads and works. | Can't set reminders, can't talk in Twitter Spaces, can't watch replays.... And the character limit is stupid. Please remove it. Not getting full notifications, and when I click on any notification the entire notification bar clears Can't follow people even after 3 day break even tho I originally only followed 10-12 in a row on that one day | It's a great app. | its not working properly in my fone tell me I've deleted several time and install again but its not running please sort out this issue what happened to Twitter app | Great Experience | Its not working properly , just notification given but app is not runing . I dont know why ? | I like a platform with no censorship | This is a great app. To have..good news etc. | Please solve the problem of profile picture upload failed please Elon musk.🤣 | Twitter getting worse and worse since Musk bought it. He completely changes the initial intention of this platform. Nobody wants to see Twitter become an app for everything. Also hate the new logo and that ads play unmuted as default, which shouldn't be the case. The algorithm is absolutely horrible right now. Also more bots then ever before and a lot of scam ads. | Best for free speech | Good | Kindly! Update the Sindhi language translation packet in your new version.Some time Sindhi translation couldn't gave us in some posts or tweets.We have faced difficult Sindhi to an other translation World languages. | Good | Horrifying | Don't open | Fav one social media app | Just grow up my account please | Got curious, uninstalled the app a few minutes later. 10/10 would not do again i would not recommend this to my worst enemy. This app shows you everything that's wrong with humanity and why it's so fun to watch. | 🖐👏✨ | Good app | Amazing | World's number 1 social media app | Change it back to Twitter | This application is so good. But since last Month this App is very very slow and vedios don't play when you play in full screen. And not responding good to User. Please exact this app. | Good | The app has become too much slow nowadays. It takes time to seach people load accounts play video's damn everything is soo damn slow n irritating. .. | Twitter is finally a good app, now that it became X and they silence less people's voices. | Always having connection problems, so many bots, just unbelievable how much its got worse since elon got it | الله is almighty | Free speech is great to have | Good app | I first started using Twitter over 10 years ago. It used to be excellent but over the last year or so it has from a great app to a terrible far right disinformation platform. Recent releases are very buggy and the app is no longer usable. No wonder users are leaving in droves for competitor apps. | I would recommend not to download this application as this application never share their profit with monetized accounts like Facebook and Instagram and TikTok so they wants to keep their profit into their pocket only and even if you hold your account they will not allow you to keep posting your links into your account wall so be careful while download this application and this is absolutely ridiculous I'm going to uninstall it | This like to be a shambuliga the ur from tel me I am in also have forget me told tull sering maklu aging this problem was not resolved | Nice | Never updating, it's still Twitter | Love it 😍 | Twitter was usable before Elon's take over, now it's just really bad. Ads being hard to differentiate from other tweets is bad, bots being in a lot of a tweet's replies, and more. Use OldTwitter by dimden. | ELON MUSK BOUGHT IT 💀💀💀💀💀 | Keep shining | Great! I'm very happy with X! | Beautiful app | Elon rules | I love how there is a fact check statement to clarify people's posts. Everyone should love this no matter where your stand with your views. | 👺 | The app is rampant with bots and it hides your friend's posts from you unless you obsessively stalk them | The app neep a lot of development. | just downloaded this and my account is already locked or like suspended idk, I can't dm anyone, my post can't be public. i literally did everything I've was asked but still no. | Best app tq | Cool | I love it so much it is also so much fun and enjoyable.Although it is not very ''kid appropriate'' but besides that I don't have any problemwith this app | I'm always getting kicked from group chats out of nowhere, this app is also slow... need a fix update at this point | The picture is not loading while I got good network 😔 | Bug. Tweets are ""protected"" even though I am subscribed to the sender AND he is ALSO subscribed to me! This needs to be fixed. | i love everything so far but it'd be nicer if the bookmarks have customisable folders to organise my favourite tweets, please do consider doing this! | Absolute unadulterated junk. This app is appalling it never works even when you try to remove any trace of it and reinstall. Given up. | Great experience | I like the service | Is broken sign up | Only @randomdena ke liya download kar raha hu hindutva ke liye jai shree ram | found ownselV here | Buffering is slow. | I want the old name back. | Fix the sudden tl refresh problem. | No matter how good is my internet, it's always loading and taking time to show posts. | Haven't been banned or put in X jail for my opinions which is really nice unlike other platforms Thank you Elon 👏🏻 | Worst literally worst | Love it! | There is a very annoying bug where tweets will load but images won't. I run into this most days and I don't know how to resolve it. | Great 😃💯 | Want to come home and get some food for you and you can do it for me 💋💘 I'm sure you will get it on | Good Reach | too many bugs. in my phone, i am always automatically exit to the app. | It's a good source | Making users download your app because you made the browser version unusable should be punishable by life without parole. | Rohit | Cool App, but the more is expected though. Like uploading videos of large data file | This is a very mbuzi app | Great app | Deleting forever. Won't let me even log into my existing account - and I was logged in before. They have definitely destroyed the service and the app. What a waste. When you delete people's existing accounts, do you really think they would bother to make a new account? Honestly, just stop existing altogether so you won't waste ""existence"" 🙄 | What a rubbish Elon Musk has build. It was fantastic when it was Twitter. This X App is completely thrashed. Loading..... Loading..... Loading.... Then says Network Error pls try again later. | Creating a post is a hassle. You never know if it's going to succeed. Many other bugs, fix it! | Very good | opan q nahi ho rhee ya | Nice app👍👍 | Best for all fields of life | I need an option to hide replies with midea for ppl I don't follow Other than that everything is nice | It keeps saying username incorrect tangika yawaa ka | Good | good | Sliding down but it slide me horizontal instead. | Good app | Informative | The worst aap ever, who unnecessary suspended accounts | Good,.always updated | My Twitter account very bad condition | Free speech, ahead. | Love it hate it smell it | Best | Hey man, it's Twitter. There are a few glitches, but it works for the most part. | It isn't working in Pakistan | Excellent | I LOVE ❤ this app since Elon has taken over, I got where I hard read Twitter any more, and after it was purchased, I gave it another try. I'm so glad I did. Now I look forward to reading everyone comments. | Nothing works, timeline never refreshes | It's gotten better but still needs stuff | i do have a registered phone number but it wont let me sign up , im from malaysia btw | Very nice app you is so very happy feel is good right now can you have so please install app and wish you very best luck 💘 | Fake propaganda... Worst app.. no accountability.. any one can use anybody's life and image. Worst | Easy to use. My only social media. | App won't load when charging!! While my phone is on the charger the app won't load tweets, forcing me to disconnect my charger and restart the app just to get it to load. | Excellent app in all ramifications | It's alot better now | Jake Dorsey is a Trump hater ... | Deadly entertaining | TY MR MUSK | Previous some days x were not working properly | Love it... | Haven't been receiving messages until I go to the messages tab and refresh multiple times for them to finally load | Best information app | Superior | I put only two stars because of the security scare, that doesn't know if it is a threat or not | Fanatical | Can't even sign in to this | Show fotos vidio scene when share post to other apps | 2nd only to Rumble for Free speech | Great app | Very good | Not working | Bon | It's amazing | The app is fine but the content is just the worst - hateful and divisive. In 50 years X will be taught to children as a cautionary tale on the harmful effects of propaganda | Wow | I can not change my profile without getting an error code. | The best. | I love this app so much when I'm so tired I open it and enjoy it with the treads (posts) or with breaking news or ...

Als App für den Verkauf dann fast unbrauchbar, in der Zeit hätte ich bei Wettbewerbern bereits mehrere Bestellungen abschließen können. | 👍👍👍👍 | it was taking me so hard to place an order, but the costumers service was great to have put me through, and everything went well ❤️‍🩹 | Funktioniert nicht | handige app. maakt het bestellen op een mobiel makkelijker. | god pris men ikke alltid rabatt for meg hvergang jeg la kurven bare etter en dager 10 prosent rabatt blir borte. | die beste kleidung | love it | Great clothes, good customer service, easy to return items if needed. | Good quality. 👌 | awesome❤️❤️❤️ | ik krijg altijd de mooiste en perfecte dingen voor mijn gezin bij bonprix. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️ | grosse Auswahl an Bekleidung , auch gute Qualitāt fūr den kleineren Geldbeutel... die Unterwāsche Angebote sind unschlagbar, sehr hūbsch , tragen sich gut, perfekter Schnitt und ūberstehen hāufiges Waschen anstandslos | Good products. Easy checkout. Thanks | teilweise teuerer als in den Katalog. | love it! | Will not let you redeem discount codes, navigation is clunky, will not let you log in. Terrible app. | The app is using the default browser, and unless you have Chrome installed - the discounts will not ve activated. Make the app compatible with other browsers also. | Very good. | Nice clothes with a good fit | You have to login everytime. | Ich habe ständig Probleme mit meinem Warenkorb und kann deswegen nicht kaufen. Vom deutschen Support habe ich gehört, dass es sich um ein internes Problem handelt, und sie wissen nicht, wann es gelöst wird. Eindeutig erbärmlich. | It was an ok shopping experience. Could use some freshening up at the check out stage to make it look and feel a bit more modern. And my God could they use the introduction of Vipps payments!! | excellent | love this , fantastic prices , great qaulity!!! | very nice and comfortable to wear ,durable | Shame about the extra €5 delivery cost.. | Good service | great service .fast delivery.. | Sehr gut | great app | Super! | wow.very good | Exactly like it is on the picture. very nice | 👍👍👍 | Dank der Verbesserung kann ich die App nicht mehr installieren. Danke für nichts,nicht jeder kann alle sechs Monate ein neues Telefon kaufen | I only shop at Bonprix now | Good | cool shop 👍 | It always logs out. | Bra kvalitet produkter och snabb skicka | Very much disappointed with this online purchase. So far I haven't received my order but they say that it's been delivered already in time. I couldn't even make a complaint or get a reimbursement . .. | good | i wish there was a language coice. i live in Germany but dont soeak German. new here. Great customer service and the clothes are really reasonable for euro standard. true to size | it's perfect with all size ranges | Einfach perfect 🥰 | Doesn't give 10% on first order through app | Payments are cumbersome, don't always go through at the 1st attempt. The store doesn't remember my card, have to find it every time I want to buy something | what I love most is that they always have plus sizes of extremely beautiful dresses for fat people, I always find my taste and my size even if I'm plus. there're also lots of sales, that makes it affordable, and lastly, I can buy and pay later in 5 months, and also in raten. that's really helpful | Seit Monaten verbugged. Zu Beginn wurde mir nur die Eingabe in der Suche angezeigt. Dann wurde eine Bestellung nicht übermittelt, dass Geld über PayPal jedoch gezahlt. Dann wurde jedoch bei jeder zweiten Aktion eine Fehlermeldung angezeigt. Jetzt, etwa zwei Monate später: Nichts hat sich geändert. Keine Bugs wurden gefixt, keine Updates ausgerollt. Nichts. Nada. Habe die App deinstallieren, weil ich nicht den ganzen Tag mit einer Bestellung vergeuden will. | jag älskar Bonprix! | Jättebra | Ich bin mit der App sehr zufrieden. Das Einzige was mich stört ist, dass die App einen nach kurzer Zeit wieder aus dem Account abmeldet und man sich ständig neu anmelden muss statt einfach angemeldet zu bleiben. | I am trying to navigate and shop, but the app keeps freezing and shutting down several times. If this is not resolved in a few days, I will have to uninstall it. I don't have the patience for this. | great shopping find what you want but, is there availability...??? no, that's the problem with bon prix. | as a mother i am really happy that you have sizes for children that are taller or a little wideder than most other children. i really appreciate this since most other internet shops do not provide this and are very lacking in this area. keep it up in this area 😊😊😊😊 | Love bonprix ❤️ | fast delivery friendly free return service and first of all, excellent quality highly recommended | Der ""Da ist etwas schief gelaufen"" ist schon sehr langweilig.. | App blijft regelmatig hangen en/of wordt afgesloten. Selectie blijft, maar maat laat voornamelijk uitverkocht zien bij grote maten (als model nooit in die maat beschikbaar is!) en iedere keer als je een item bekijkt gaat je daarna naar begin van de pagina. Heel irritant want bij scrollen opent steeds onbedoelt items waar je geen interesse n hebt, waardoor je onnodig lang bezig bent voor een bestelling of afhaakt. Kortingscode zoals vermeld in gids werkt niet! | Man bekommt seit 2 Monaten nur http Fehler beim Öffnen der Artikel um die Details zu sehen. | Bonprix app 2.0 pour Android Samsung Galaxy S20 running Android v 12 Fonction Filtre/Tri ne fonctionne pas ! Exemple : 154 articles short femme Filtrer sur Taille Haute (16) Toujours ""Montrer 154 articles"" Pffft! | good deal | The app is a bit slow to rotate between pages at times, but the assortment of products is nice. The guides to ""know your size"" really helped me finally find bras that fit me. | quality and great prizes. | I have been using the app for about 8-10 years now and it's still SO LAGGY AND SLOW. I don't want to use the app anymore because it's such a nuisance to use. Why hasn't there been an update to improve the speed yet? | Worst online shop..I thought they will deliver within just one week .I emailed them bcoz as I've seen on my account 3 days after the day i ordered .The item wasn't improving , no estimated date when will be the delivery.Then their respond on my email.They don't know when will be the item available so, they could not tell when is the delivery.shocks! What's the used of posting the product when it wasn't available.Purchaser paid it advance so, pls be reliable to your customer too! | supet | Ужасно. Установил и сразу удалил. Так и не смог зарегистрироваться. Имя не принимает (писал латиницей), требует ставить галочки для рассылки ВСЕМИ способами, капча, дважды пароль..., почта. Предполагаю после всего надо еще ссылку на почте подтвердить....Я что какой то квест прохожу по проверке настойчивости при регистрации? | Still receiving post when I've already requested not to in the past. I don't appreciate being sent garbage when I've already asked to stop | Super! | Good quality and sizing. Fast delivery. | Wanted to buy something but the app is so slow I gave up | The downloading of the pages is much slower compared to the others thus surfing takes a lot of time. | Nice | App works very well - easy to search, choose, order and pay. I especially like the discounts with free postage that are exclusively for purchases via the app. Merci Bonprix ! | Easy to order, fast delivery, good quality | The app seems a little slow when kscrolling on the mobile. Other than that it's a great shop with quality clothing that is affordable and sizes are what they say they are with everything. Great experience for returns and customer service was friendly and helpful. Delivery indicated is also on time. Thank you BonPrix 😁 | Good prices for nice cloths | love the quality, prices and service! | bonprix hat alles fur alle, den bester online shopping kundenservice | It says on web that if I download the app I get 10%, I have spent 108euro and nothing :( | I am so happy about the app and also I really like shopping at Bonprix, they are very good. | Overall, I am a satisfied and happy customer. bonprix is my best online fashion shopping shop but recently I can't open anything anymore, it keeps saying something went wrong, and the suggestion for matching items is no longer available. Please fix it customer service because it's very annoying. Thanks | I use it regularly and but some lovely stuff! I do iti Italian as I live in Italy and am happy to say I am a very satisfied customer!! | Het doet wat ie moet doen | Achteraf betalen met ideal werkt niet. Heb op internet meerdere klachten gelezen, en Bonprix wenst er niks aan te doen. Waarom die dienst aanbieden als je niet zorgt dat het werkt? | Very comfortable for shipping 🙂 | super | Sehr Schön app | Not the language I understand why is it not in English so I uninstall it if only I can give 0 star why since the beginning of this year it went back to stranger language again it forstrating 🥵 | Nice fashion, crashin passion | Very laggy app. Every new page it prompts me to sign up to their newsletter. It logs me in but then I go to my account and it says there was an error logging in. Use your pc and webbrowser for a better experience. | Prima app, reageert wel wat langzaam. | badly performing, I'll go back to the mobile website | Good | I've just ended up buying the sane products again because it doesn't let you know you've purchased it before unless you check you bank .... now I have to try and send the sane items back .... and it doesn't tell you how unless I refuse the delivery ... it's rediculous | The app feels so sluggish, and scrolling through the products is such slow and annoying experience. Terrible. | Macht alles einfach mit dem App auf dem handy, muss nicht mehr bonprix googln | Ich mag diese App, weil sie sehr einfach zu bedienen ist | Wenn ich etwas in die Einkaufstasche packe verschwindet es nach einiger Zeit einfach. Die Artikel werden nirgendwo ""zwischengespeichert"". Da vergeht mir dann die Lust nochmal alles zu suchen. Ansonsten sehr gut aufgebaute App. | It's shame that this app it's only in German. | Jätte smidigt ♥️♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍 | Easy to make up the order, one star down due to no possibility to set own password or change it | Good app | Terrible slow app and makes it very hard to navigate when trying to buy products. I have stopped using it so many times just because it was so slow and keeps freezing! If you want to make money update your app!!! IN REPONSE TO YOUR REPLY- I've been using your app and website for years and it's always been slow not 'sometimes' but ALL THE TIME. Update your systems because it affects your sales as I know people who actually stopped using you all together because of your terrible slow app and website | Easy 👍 | Great | Top | Very good app | Very good 👍 | Fonctionne bien | Lovely clothes reasonable prices | Easy to use, convenient, visually bright | Quality and affordable | Super gute App! Ich bin suuper zufrieden!! | Molto m satisfatta Grazie bonprix | Ottima app, facile da usare, prodotti fantastici | Buona!! | Fint app och affären! | 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 | Wieso kann man payback nummer im app nicht eingeben??? | Wide selection, good rates and quick deliveries.. What' else🤗 | Sehr gut | Customer service totally absent, lying about transportation as well... Had to order 1 piece of cloth at a time which caused me to have to pay more in delivery fees... | Die App hängt total beim scrollen und auswählen der Stücke. So macht online Shopping keinen Spaß. | Very nice app to buy some quality good products | After updates, I get http bad request and unable to use the app anymore. Can you help?? | Ich finde die Bon Prix App sehr gut. Man super nach Produkten suchen und filtern. Die App ist übersichtlich und einfach zu bedienen. | Love this online store. Nice products. Lovely fashion especially considering that I'm not a fashion person. Would be great if the app allowed you to pay via ideal, it's been years since this function was no longer available in the Netherlands. The uitverkochte items shouldn't be advertised either or still be available to view. | very good app. good quality clothes (cotton) at a good price | It would be great if there was a option to change/choose the language while installing.

Oceňuji možnost výběru kategorií (nebo vypnutí, např. produktů pro zvířata), hodilo by se přidat přímé reklamace jako na Rohlíku. Samovolné odhlašování pominulo, ale poslední verze je pomalejší a má horší ergonomii. Produkty jsou nahodile promíchané, což spolu s jejich pomalým načítáním dost znepříjemňuje nákup. | Položky jako zelí nejdou objednat na kusy ale jen na kila. Ostružiny jsme dostali plesnivé. Víckrát se nám stalo, že objednaná potravina expirovala hned druhý den. Sami bychom si do košíku vybrali lépe. Některé položky, které v Albertovi jsou, online nejsou. Dáte hledat ""rohlik"" a vyhledá vám to jen alkohol. Aplikace zamrzá. Zkusíme Tesco. | Dobrý den, je prosím možné ponechat původní velikost ikon v nákupním košíku atd? Nové velké ikony jsou až příliš velké, na obrazovku telefonu se takto vleze výrazně méně položek, což zbytečně komplikuje použití appky. Taktéž prison o možnost trvalého přihlášení v aplikaci. Předem děkuji za zvážení | oproti rohlíku a košíku je aplikace docela bída z pohledu UX a příjemností pouzivani | aplikace naprosto nepouzitelna kvuli obchodnim podminkam - vice nez 30 stran - povinnost nekolik hodin pravidelneho cteni i pred kazdym nakupem!?! . . . Arogantni odpoved: ""smirte se s tim"". | user friendly and great for specials | Domů zdarma, ale za dopravu si nejspíše zaplatíte, ponovu. Vyhledávání bych naprogramoval lépe i za den. Dokonce jsem vám na to poslal nabídku, ale neobdržel od vás žádnou reakci. | aplikácia je intuitívna, dobre sa s ňou pracuje, aj vyhľadávanie funguje dobre. chýba mi prepojenie Albert bonusového klubu s aplikáciou. | Nebyl problem uskutecnit cely nakup a najit vsechny produkty. | would be nice to have the app optimised for tablets as well | Good app, I would appreciate if saved shopping list can also be arranged by categories/items grouped together. It's that possible, please? Thanks in advance! | No English | Hodne pomala aplikace | Již lze objednávat přes PC. | opravte si terminy dodani. je to docela zasadni. vyberu sobota a v aplikaci se nacte nedele atd!!! | Absence podopory jazyku. Google pay. UI nesikovne a neprehledne udelane nacpat tam vikendovy nakup je fuska. A nakonec na samsungu S22 si ocividne ani nezaplatim kartou 6 pokusu a zadre se to na external prohleci a to ze si nepamatuje zadane karty radej nemluvim. | After 1 year the English language still missing... Is it so complicated? | I ordered water and application took additional payment from me because of possible differences in weight. It is not a free delivery they took money from us anyway. | Nemuzou zaplatit za nakup! | Je fajn, že existuje služba, která doručí domů zadarmo. Aplikace je ale velmi nepraktická, práce s ní je zdlouhavá. Albert má také mnohem větší sortiment, než který nabízí zde. | Apka super, len pridávanie do košíka chce prepracovať | aplikaci si nevyhledem pod klicovym slovem albert, pri vyhledavani v aplikaci mi vyskakuji irelevantní výsledky Edit: v obchode se aplikace najde, ale jakozto běžný uživatel aplikaci otvírat z aplikací v telefoně a ne přes obchod | Aplikace je neskutečně pomalá, někdy neregistruje dotyk na displej (i když do toho klepu jak datel), a když se snažím v nákupním seznamu sjet až dolů, tak mě aplikace vrací do prostředí seznamu. | Je fajn, ze je videt nejaky rozvoj, ale nejde triditnapr podle Bio. Celkove pomale reakce aplikace | One of the best apps I've ever used!!! | pomalé, nepřehledné,bez webové alternativy | Why was my review removed? | Sortiment je celkem omezený (např. chybí cukr krystal), aplikace se načítá docela pomalu. Ale jinak je to docela fajne. | Only in CZ and as it is an app only (not possible to view through web browser) it is not possible to translate. | Po nainstalování jsem ověřil email a aplikace mne vyzvala k nákupu. Vybral jsem, ale platba se nepovedla. Po delším zkoumání jsem si všiml, že nemám vyplněné oslovení a telefon. Vyplnil jsem a zkusil platbu znovu. Opět neúspěšně. Pak jsem si vzpomněl na ""Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again?"", vynutil jsem ukončení aplikace, spustil, ignoroval výzvu k potvrzení mailu a ejhle, platba se povedla.*** Mimochodem, když vyhledám zboží, proč se mi nezobrazí křížek na smazání vyhledávacího pole hned, ale až do toho pole ťuknu? V okamžiku, kde se mi zobrazují vyhledané produkty, není na stránce nic, čím bych se mohl vátit do seznamu kategorií.*** Když něco vyhledám, hodil by se mi z daného artiklu proklik na příslušnou kategorii (třeba z informačnho okna, tam je místa dost).*** Hledám banan - zobrazí se nalezené banány, banány v čokoládě, kiwi? mango? avokádo? Hledám Banán, nabídne mi vyhledávat v Banán Výživa, Banán v Raw, Banán v Suché plody (2x? - aha - dvě různé kategorie se jmenují stejně, takže problém dat a ne přímo programátorů aplikace). ***Když kupuji např. ananas, dozvím se cenu jednoho kusu. A pak se nechám překvapit velikostí? (Uznávám, tohle není na programátory, pošlete to dále :-)). *** Jak se kupuje 5kg brambor, když chci koupit brambory volné? (Nápověda - Rohlík mě sice taky nechá klikat jako bych hrál nějakou hru, ale kromě počtu kusů zobrazuje odhad váhy, programátoři Tesca mne nechají brambory a podobné nakoupit na kusy nebo na váhu.) *** Přišlo mi oznámení ""Omlouváme se ..."", ťukl jsem na něj, otevřela se aplikace, ale za co se omlouvají jsem nezjistil. A oznámení je už pryč. | Only in Czech | The usability could improve, I find the Bascet view quite small. | Nelze změnit heslo, nemůžu se do aplikace přihlásit.

I spent more time clearing out the ads and using the program. plus they want to push you, to buy their other programs. | Pay for cleaning cache:( | I used this back in 2009.. tries today on phone.. pathetic now . literally cleaning is paid..what's the point of giving free version with ads when you don't even allow browser data cleaning.. I'll recommend people to try different apps | I have a subscription. I am on holiday, now when i want to use a product i paid for that it's not supported in this country!? You're running some criminal operation here. | Awesome | Will not function for free. | This app cleaned 2mb on my phone. It showed me how much more it could clean, but I have to pay for that service.

Sorry. | great | always been a fan on pc. works great on Android also | excellent | Will not load | good | Very v nice *****2024. | good app for junk file cleaning | you should add the "" automatic move to external storage "" feature when performing a clean . We have sd cards in many phones and we are always switching to external storage to save space in our internal storage | good app | I use the PC version and this mobile version is a disappointment. Ads are ridiculous especially considering the PC version has none, even for the free version. I'm not sitting through 6 minutes of triple stacked ads for a kneecapped version of something I can access for free on my computer. Probably better if you're willing to pay for pro, but I'm not. | Too many requests to allow notifications, upgrades etc. Not simple enough. | nice app | good | Ilove this | 清取取要錢 | This used to be a decent phone cleaning tool. To use the deep clean function, you would just have to sit through an ad. Now it appears in the latest update, you have to sit through an ad just for the quick clean, and the deep clean function are locked behind a pay wall. At that point it's no longer worth it. | best | The app is very good.

Don't bother with it | Thank you for this information | works great with no problems! | Quick and effective and easy to use | It used to be a good app just ads now | New version crashes on cleaning Chrome. Doesn't complete cleaning. | very nice 👍 | really good 👍 app | Recentlr upgraded but nothing seems to have changed. How do I check to make sure all is well. I am a longtime user of this program and am happy with it. This is a great tool . | crippled nagware | better | Worked great. Very good app | It works | Cancel the new charge for 7.99 please | Been using this product for years. | It never worked in landscape on Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. I told their robot email many times.

I recommend it. | I couldn't resist it | I call this the best cleaner I give it a number one | good stuff easy to use | CCleaner is the best app to use. I also use it on every PC that I own and I own quite a few!! | Best among the best.. 😊 😊 😊 | best cleaning app hands down | Absolutely Pathetic.

Despite having used the app since years, I can't explain myself how a delete junk files ends up in deleting the ALL FOTOS AND VIDEOS at once within a minute. There's no way to restore the data by myself, so I need a data recovery service with estimated costs of 400€. This is my story of why I have to give this app this rating.

Further, there is no option to turn this off. This essentially ruins the usability of Zoom. Wanna add let someone into your room during a call? Good luck! Wanna adjust the volume? Oops, no screen to see anymore. It's maddening. And Zoom has known about this for at least 10 months. Horrible app. Use anything else if you have the choice."",""Horrible app! There's no way to put the meeting on \""speaker phone\"" so it only has the max volume of a phone call, meaning it's really hard to hear if it's not up to your ear. But that's weird because if you're holding your phone up to your ear, you're missing the video. I basically couldn't attend this webinar at all thanks to the zoom app, don't waste your time."",""Zoom never syncs with my device's audio settings, and has no audio settings of its own. Zoom can't be muted. Zoom destroys the audio quality of other apps most of the time. This isn't a hardware limitation when it works perfectly fine sometimes. Zoom randomly changes its own audio settings when starting up or playing sounds from other apps. Even when writing this review, my Zoom randomly shut off, and closed my meeting entirely."",""This review is more specific to Zoom Phone as a standalone phone. The line cuts audio out of the app is minimized, or you lock your phone. Inbound calls do not ring not matter how many settings, or ringtones I change. Often calls that I do manage to visually see come in, disconnect or time out while trying to answer. As phone line for a business, this is completely unusuable. I thought BlackBerry movius was bad, but this is tragic."",""UI/UX design is bad. It's my 3rd use and still can't figure out how to blur background while in a meeting and the guide I saw on google is not correct. Blur background should be the most important feature in your application and hsould have a quick access to it 2nd is bluetooth earbuds. It doesn't auto recognise the device, Mute, blur background feature should be present even during waiting time.""]",false,false,false,"us.zoom.videomeetings","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Google Translate is the reliable option. | Was brilliant, now only ever says ""something went wrong"" when I use audio input | I've been using this for years now.

Thank you in advance for your attention | Doesn't work | One of the most accurate translet apps I've ever used. The interface is simple. | Why don't you make a quick translate button that will be located in the quick settings menu (among the wifi, bluetooth, etc. buttons). So that the translation button is not always on the screen and does not waste additional resources and screen space.

I am very much happy with this app, and it's been an enjoyable experience learning from it. | The best! | Apparently, this DeepL App translates less literally than Google. A native Italian colleague of mine said, ""DeepL is more human, Google is more literal."" | Good for translate written text but when I try to speech to text function it shows me ""To use this feature, give the Speech Services app microphone permission"". I go to settings but the permissions are all granted I can't use this function but I don't know why.

Most accurate . An backup for Google translate | Super! | I like this translator | Even worse than google translate, also duplicating the same word for translation. lacks certain languages. disappointed with recent gtranslate? this isnt it. | Great app. One of the few I've found that really gets Portugal Portuguese, it is free and no ads. Very clean interface. Wish it had an off line feature, would happily pay for that feature. | Will give one more extra star if we can login with our Google account and one other star if we can save offline dictionary so we can translate even if no internet | It would be helpful if it was translating swearing words. Instead you get ***** which is useless | Picture translation feature does not work | Dude seriously, what the hell? The app doesn't translate from pictures anymore. It keeps the original language the same, that is to say Japanese text on a picture doesn't translate to English. The translation remains the same. This was working fine, now you broke it. Also it doesn't allow me to highlight specific text anymore. Why would you remove this functionality? Just another case of app devs trying to fix stuff that ain't broken. What're y'all smoking? | Useful because it has European Portuguese. Thank you! | The best translator yet. Keep up the good work! | My experience with DeepL is really fun. It's easy and convenient to use. But I would love if it could have been automatic page translator and you can translate directly on your chat on any page. | DeepL was great in helping me on my trip to Japan. I'm still learning the language and by using the app, I was able to communicate more complicated sentences and translate when store staff were trying to help me find something. | Totally get this app if you need to translate anything! I recommend it for anyone. | Hey! I love the app, but everytime I try to log in to do a translation with larger word content ...it says ""technical error"" I have registered...but it just won't go in. I tried to download the app again and it still won't allow me to log in. Feedback please? | Awesome translator! Better than Google one at least in two languages. | I like all of the features and their uses, it's just perfect to me that you can even translate while watching a serie or scrolling | Najlepszy tłumacz z jakim miałem do czynienia. Edit: Trochę czasu minęło od napisania przeze mnie pierwotnej opinii i ... Wszystko idzie do przodu a deepl się cofa, wprowadzone ograniczenia w długości tekstu dla darmowego użytkownika oraz fakt jak bardzo aplikacja odbiega jakością tłumaczenia w porównaniu z tłumaczeniami za pomocą GPT skutecznie ją dyskwalifikują. Po co z sentymentu płacić za coś co można mieć za darmo ze znacznie większą dokładnością tłumaczenia? | great app, translates very well. | why this app claim is completely free not mention to pro version just after u download app | nice app | Absoloutly brilliant. | A good alternative to Google Translate | just so easy to use | A great app! | better then other | dont work | Very good, no other words 🤗👍 | Overall not to bad but constantly mixes up the 'he and she' pronouns when using the audio translator fromChinese to english. | I do not have any words | It helps so much with my German language | Although this has been recommended to me by a lot of people, I haven't tried it until this year and I regret not using this earlier. The pronunciations are much more accurate compared to a certain other widespread translator. The translations as well; I love that it gives the option to choose the format of each sentence, clarifying each word. It has helped me make sense of different slangs and more complicated sentences. (ie. languages with optional first person nouns, different grammar etc) | When I use it on my laptop I reach very fast after few sentences the ""max daily limit"". Here is 1 star for shortening the daily limit to few sentences. Take the fee for monthly subscription and shove it... also it is slow and often there is message saying the site is overloaded due to high usage. But maybe if you put 20 euro monthly fee that will solve your problems haha 🤡 | nice translation | Sadly, This app is unable to resolve text from a machine display that Google translate can. This app detects no text. I'll admit the contrast isn't great but this app doesn't even make an attempt where Google translate does. | I didn't like new update its worse than old version, what did you do. Please fix this asap | Absolute Privacy 🔐❤️❤️❤️❤️ | The best translation platform ever, the precision is so good, highly recommend it. | I love that it gives me options of translations. It feels more conceptual. I also love dark mode! | best translation app | fantastic translator. Superior to any other I tried so far. | this is a really good app for language translation. I enjoyed it a lot. you can use it for professional and also informal translations. I recommend it to all my friends | Please, support offline use for specific languages that can be downloaded. Also allow the app to rotate for landscape use. | very good app | The camera translator does not work well, it does not detect the language to be translated and it does not translate well, if you can check and fix that problem, I would greatly appreciate it, thank you | Is it possible to change the voices for Spanish? | This app is pretty good for translating but the thing is the limit.Why is there a limit for translating?It's pretty annoying.But a really good app! | Microphone input is broken ☹️ | One of the greatest Apps! | Better than Google Translate. | helpful but could've been better | cool | Super | very accurate | Very good | Today, why you suddenly remove speech mode for the pre-language, bro. When i try to translate text in website from Japanese to English, i still need to hear the speech from the japanese one, and since you suddenly remove the speech mode for the pre-language, you make it harder that i had to open the app everytime i want to listen the japanese speech....please bring pre-language's speech mode back again :/ | the best translator ever | Not free anymore | Best translation app. | Simply, it is the best tool to translate anything | Tamil translation is not available, kindly add it. | Good app | Don't update! They're charging money now. Find another app for your subpar translations. Auto translation sucks. App keeps automatically switching Japanese to Chinese. | ممتاز وبيفهم اللهجه العاميه المصريه | meilleur traducteur de tous les temps ! | Excelente aplicación | So dam good! | i hate begging for rating. | Excellent but I can't change font zize | Not perfect. But when used in comparison with other translators, the output is really readable. That being said I do use the other translators with this to get as much coverage as possible. But still in most cases DeepL gives good results the first try so that I don't need to use others so often. | After a forced update, it's no longer simply to use. It got rather fancy now, that whenever it translates from a picture, the translation appeares in place of the original words. Renders it useless for the very purpose I'd been using it. Now you never get to see the original text and the translation together. Before that you could always see what did it recognise and edit the text. With Iapanese and Chinese that's a must. If it gets sorted, I'll give it more stars. | This app is a phenomenal example for translating far more accurately than other certain translators. | Please add filipino language | ok, this is scarily accurate. | Суперское | Best | Really useful translation app. More accurate than others, have wide alternative. | Just a couple of suggestions: On the web side, somehow, countless sentences appear showing the use of the translated words, but in the app, only a couple of each one is shown. The other suggestion: Latin, please? Thanks in advance. | Excellent app. Findvit incredibly accurate and helpful. | No hindi language in this translater.verry disappointing...","{""1"":10268,""2"":3159,""3"":6318,""4"":21326,""5"":162077}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","DeepL SE","7340217812244253237","android@deepl.com","https://www.deepl.com/de/translator",,"https://www.deepl.com/privacy","7340217812244253237","Books & Reference","BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE","[{""name"":""Books & Reference"",""id"":""BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0IH4L3pX-jqQXKYCDmxTM5t3Tvak2cb_zUuIs9nKCHPeOqkaRJ_bRTq1qKawsSvunw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TzMgUBGWT5z7J2aFC0Fbh6kaiBwjRfunUtwJ_pV2pSSnDNbpsnaUDdLAzJcUvKyR7Mg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r8knSYsKV91oyqSduqyMwXQkf-3LEZKYJqxccMpMMqD9FagK-cgWmmQcjRTBNQPN_-Mu"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/beiH6TaMS6FU3obx_mz06xMNlyfswsX514wxd-BOoSmqwcTVrVReVyCvXrs3O1K6Nw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jA8eCKQM-5Ml09HQW4NP7GcRIw5X3CUspU1N-QLl4wfZVse7x6_o-QmYiG4IJDMYvsU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uOlo-9V_FY9wwRQhGmKBBaH7KdkuJJbYFVa6pzJ1LwME7WyOnFiyXR37FX3BfDQFzi0l"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RGwiw3xzFnADXkxBZE3sxByGiSuWzJB1OC1QMJMw6utbJxAomFgqlT4WYkiFHQ9EuZX0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V4HYD28OlXTTITquwOmNN4wuOGcuNhZY_Nra-H4uRdP2abItvuVV4DRzOP2miWZAHvk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/--stRLzWRN9ivKgAmRrrwOWPLwmimQceM06ic6mkxid6Aggi57cd2zxW76J0QVeZQA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ki-Za9XsD2s8O9P5l4_-C3YzGZgLkBnTtr29qbS6D6FcxbqB08bPz-R28gMKRTZqI5k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-tbkoWYWLJH1WOu06D3blMgEeOdA9KF8498r_75ooj_mUi4MRnLvlOsqCFpo7P7e0bM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b09pcHWoDzH1RW2bXSEW0TAMejGfqr9tuiSKra2bDy6iagI87DWSmBkipXGJCkgjVVk""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jan 30, 2022",1708949037000,"24.3","No big news this time, but that’s only because we’ve been working hard on improving your experience: <br><br>- Fixed several bugs<br>- Enhanced the usability <br>- Planned and designed further for the future of translation","[""Amazing app and service.

Nemit UPC tak jsem u O2, ti se sice chovaji jako dobytci, ale maji kvalitni mobilni sit. | When trying to change my plan keeps offering me a new number. Very slow application, sometimes nonresponsive | Dočkáme se v roce 2024 konečně podpory Google Pay? Už je to opravdu směšné, muset pořád vyplňovat kartu. Když už podporujete Apple Pay, tak byste mohli podporovat i tohle. | Nepamatuje heslo, opakuje se problém s přihlášením | This app barely works. You cant even pay with google pay. | Exellent | Often cannot login. I receive an error and ""try again later"" message | 2🌟 za to že väčšinou aspoň fungujú platby, je to vlastne jediná vec ktorú používam. Ináč hrozne dlhá doba načítania.

Not very user friendly | Neustale se zapina Biometricke prihlaseni kdyz se chci prihlasit pomoci hesla. Uz 100x jsem zaklikl ze to nechci. Druha vec je proc me to neustale odhlasuje. | good app。 | Extremely confusing app interface. | Often doesn't work when I need it. Edit: Is new phone enough for you? Still buggy when I need it. | I am sorry, but it is very underwhelming to the extreme, the Permanent login option simply does not work, the password reset process is arduous as it is and when you try to setup a new password, it simply will now allow for it....until it allows, randomly. The services are great, the staff too, but if I were to rate the app only, 1/5. | Zmatečná aplikace, odmítá mě přihlásit od posledního updatu. | The responses from the Vodafone staff here are a joke. They do not even respect the language. Every single time the app is launched to pay the monthly bill, it nags with unwanted offers. Forces you to accept targeting cookies if you already explicitly refused them before. The same with forcing you to accept marketing calls. Over and over again. Pushing it down your throat. | Neni možné dobít kredit na 200 nebo 300 Kč, jenom 400 a více! | so so so slow, I feel like I could marry, have 6 kids, divore and remarry and it still wouldn't be loaded | Absolutely horrible app. It's unbelievable that a corporation like Vodafone thinks that having Ann app like this is acceptable. It's unbelievably slow, unresponsive and a mess to navigate in. --update 12/23: app is still terrible. Vodafone doesn't care. | Proc se automaticky aktivuji data po vycerpani zakladniho balicku, i kdyz mam jeste nevycerpany 5gb pack v offers? | The worst app ever | No hrůza. Pořád se mám logovat i když uz jsem zalogovany. Při kontrole ip adresy to zmrzne. Noční můra stejně jako jejich servis. V 17:05 v pracovní den se mi už nejsou schopni věnovat. At zavolám zítra. Je Vodafone pořád mezinárodní komunikační firma? | Opravdu nerozumím tomu, jak aplikace velkého českého operátora může být tak nefunkční a problematická. | Slow | It's comprehensive, useful | Such a rip off | Pekni hit | I can't even login to the app. | Extrémne pomalá aplikácia s nelogickým rozložením položiek. Za posledných 5 rokov som nevidel žiadne zlepšenie. | Terrible company. Charging for services cancelled months ago. Do not recommend company, do not recommend the app | Has got to be one of the worst apps by one of the major telecom companies. Recharging never works, money gets taken from the bank and recharge isn't successful. The UI is horrible with text and omagyes going out of bounds. | the app is buggy - permanent login feature doesn't work at all, roaming activation takes whole day to turn on. | I cannot set a name in contact informativní because the app repeatedly asks for cookies settings. When I tap the Change (cookies settings) button then it changes its color and nothing happens. Edit: Issue solved by updates. | WORST.APP.EVER.PERIOD. Why? I'd only repeat what's stated in other reviews. Develop a new one, starting from scratch, and scrap this miserable P.O.S. already. No need for developers to respond anything since they don't do anything about it anyway. No need for false courtesy. Wouldn't give it even one star, wouldn't give it zero either, it's below that. But Google won't let me post a review without a rating, even if it doesn't truly reflect my experience. | Excellent | hrozně blbý přihlašování | on this app is nothing good. Not even funny. | UI aplikace je chaotické a v aplikaci je velice složité něco najit. Spousta věcí je velice obtížné nastavit. Z nějakého důvodu je velice pomalá a načítání trvá velice dlouho v porovnání s ostatními aplikacemi. | The app is not really good when i comes to select a package it leads you to a web and you need to spend 1 hr wondering how to select a package | Exceptionally annoying. Recovering password every week. | The worst provider ever | Za sada odlicno | neuveritelnej kram ... zavedli aj otisk prstu ... ale funguje jenom pro prihlaseni - tak oprava, cert vi, kdy vlastne funguje, furt pise, ze ""emailem se nyni nelze prihlasit"" ... chjo, takze sbohem, kazdou potroublou zmenu potvrzujete heslem ... a beda 3x spatne zadat!!! ;p | Positive review unavailable in your region. | Menu is sonehow not very intuitive...Otherwise look good to me. | Great progress. | Very fancy-looking frontend, but slow and unresponsive app. | Most of the content loads very slowly. The UI is not intuitive, it's clunky and it's hard to find what you're looking for. Also the virtual assistant TOBi keeps popping up and takes space on the screen. Consider adding side menu that would be hidden unless active, and get rid of the menu at the bottom. And get rid of TOBi's big head icon please, it's dreadful. Thank you. | Can't accomplish my requests | Worst App Ever.very slow. | Desperate UX, super slow, awkward. | Extremly slow, confusing. Worst app in my phone, I am only using it because some services settings are available only through it. Shame on you Vodafone! | Frustrating, it just doesn't work, it's slow and lot of time even login doesn't work. | The slowest app I've ever used. | Extremely slow app | Fingerprint login almost never works. I must open the app every month only to get the data - ok, marketing reasons but why I must always type in the password, which is complex to be safe and I need to open PC password manager and retype it again and again? Please, make the fingerprint work properly, implement social login or do something so such useless app could be accessible easily. Thank you! | Dlouhodobě příšerně nakonfigurovaná platební brána. Po zadání v googlu uložené karty se nepropisuje datum platnosti. Po návratu z platební brány je třeba celou aplikaci restartovat, aby se opět v bráně objevily uložené karty. | Absolutely terrible app. Impossible to navigate the My Services page to buy new bundles; very poorly organised | The slowest app ever... Edited: and the worst service | Vodafone renders top-notch services and the offered products add value. Coupled with constant technological improvements and regular updates, all these and many more make Vodafone a giant in the industry. | Skutečně odporně pomalá, zalagovaná appka, na jakémkoli telefonu. Stejný problém mají dle recenzí všichni uživatelé. | The 5 star reviews are given by Vodafone employees. I know this. I was one. Changing to honest now: lowest. There is no other option and people are forced to use this. No effort, pure garbage. | Awesome! | V unoru 2022 jsem technicke podpore reportoval chybne chovani teto aplikace (ve vlastnostech uctu vidim adresu pripojovaciho mista nalezici k jinemu memu uctu), ale ani do verze 5.14.0 (kveten 2023) nedoslo k naprave... Tak snad se uz brzo dockam :-) | on the homepage, the app shows that there are no outages, but after looking specifically for outages on my address, it shows that there are two outages for 30 minutes already. please either remove the message on the homepage or make it work properly. | Incredibly miserable user experience. So hard to even get to the account, so many unnecessary validations and when I tried enabling email login it just threw bunch of weird errors in the last step and I could begin the entire validation process again. | Worst app ever always has problem with logging in and takes years to process the paid payment | It's probably the worst ""bigger company"" made app I've seen in my life in terms of UI and navigation and all. It doesn't make any sense. And overall the Czech Vodafone is just quite scummy. | Nice service | Very unreliable app. | No matter if I choose permanent login or not, it will ALWAYS LOG me OFF. I'm not going to talk about the rest.. | Extremely slow and unstable | Always ""problems"" with the payment, which ""are fixing"". The main feature of the app is to do payments. No idea how could it crush every month. I pay 800 czk per month, the mobile data is second most expensive in Europe and even then they can not make a stable app for payments. | Nejhorší společnost s pohledu chování se zákazníky. Kvůli stěhování jsem musela zrušit smlouvu a vrátit router. Router jsem vrátila v lednu a dodneška dostávám faktury od Vodafonu že musím zaplatit služby které už fyzické mi nemůžou poskytnout. Třeba dneska (21.04.2023) jsem dostala fakturu kterou musím zaplatit do 22.04.2023. Dneska je páték, tak zase dělají všechno pro prodloužení těch fakturaci a získání více peněz od zákazníka kterému fyzické nejsou schopny poskytnout žádné služby. | I don't know why company, which makes a tons of money, can't do a better app, which wouldn't be always lagging. | Bad service and weak signal in czech Republic | Vyřizovat cokoliv v této aplikaci je za trest. Z formuláře není vidět pomalu na políčko co chce člověk vyplnit. Neustálá propagace chatbota. | Hrozná aplikace. Pomalá, většina funkcionality se stejně spouští v prohlížeči, a hlavně: Pravidelně se sama odhlásí. | This is basically a glorified web browser for Vodafone only, but also slower and clunkier. It's really sad how supposedly big companies just don't care about the UX at all. | Excellent service. I am satisfied with the quality and service. | I can't believe.. How bad is this app... Doesn't Vodafone have any money for normal team to make at least user friendly app? It takes a few years... Bad... I gave to use Web app to pay the bills.. I've been using Vodafone since 1996.... | Tohle je odstrašující příklad toho, jak interface nemá vypadat. Vše je nepřehledné, nelogické a otravné. Po zapnutí se zobrazí přehled všech služeb. Po rozkliknutí čehokoliv se již nelze k přehledu předvídatelným způsobem vrátit... Navíc aplikace pořád otravuje s cookies a zobrazuje další dialogy... Nelogicky zabírá čtvrtinu displeje obrovským polem ""sdělte nám svůj kontaktní e-mail"" v situaci, kdy Vodafone můj kontaktní e-mail má... Rád bych viděl duševní pochody lidí, kteří toto stvořili... | Horrible app not remembering your login, also unable to login or change password. | Etjs | Super | Místo pořádné funkcionality pro práci s účtem a nastavení se jedná o obrázkovou aplikaci, která dělá místo reklamě | Can't pay my bill, because it says there is problem with the card (there isn't). It doesn't even have my card registered, how am I supposed to pay the bill? | Useless | Opět se nejde přihlásit. Aplikace je totální odpad. Naprosto nefunkční. Nemůžu ani normálně zaplatit tarif protože 99% času aplikace prostě nejde. Stačí už jen kousek od toho abych přešel k někomu jinému | 0/5 app is broken | This is the worst My Vodafone app I have used!! To this point I used 3 different My Vodafone apps, this is just beyond horrible! First, even when you change settings to English, nearly everything stays in Czech. Second, nothing opens, app crashes or freezes frequently. I am questioning whether they let a 5 year old make this app for them. | Infinite loading times even with the best internet connection, crashes a lot. No update til now has made it any better. I use it only if I really don't have access to a PC, otherwise would uninstall it immediately. | Asi nejhorší zákaznická podpora. Slabej signál a data jsou drahý. Nedoporučuju. Běžte k t-mobile nebo O2 a uděláte nejlíp. | Worst app ever. As a foreigner, it has zero explanation. I feel like throwing my phone everytime i open this app. | Invoice payment from the app Is not working | Když chci změnit datastrop vždy dlouho hledám v aplikaci než to najdu. Proč není přímo na jeden klik? | Perfect | Otřesená aplikace, která je konstantě nefunkční a místo aby to provedlo platbou 1 tak to proběhlo 2x.... Nesnáším Vodafone | Extemely slow | Useful but extremely slow even on a fast net... Some pages take ages to load and then tell you the service is unavailable but you can get to the same data on web without a problem... What I really like is that you can pay your bill through it quite easily and without issues. | Tohle je opravdová srágora - aplikaci s horším ovládáním jsem už dloho neviděl... | I'm ok with the app | Proč nenecháte udělat UI a strom menu člověka, který to umí? Žádné z tlačítek vůbec nedělá to, co čeká! To je srandovní, když chceš vrátit se na domovskou stránku, zmáčkneš uprostřed, něco vyjede, tak zmáčkneš levé, furt něco vyjede! To je boží tak špatně udělat intuitivní ovládání 😂 | If you need to do rilevant changes to you profile app redirect you to webpage(again login etc), so for what is needed? Often you cannot download bill. It looks nice but not really useful | Nefunguje UI. Kliknout na nabídku účtu dole lze jen po přihlášení. Pak už ne. Hromada výkalů, která neprošla žádným testováním | Things take hours to get updated. 3 hours I'm trying to get an Esim activated while that useless Tobi stares at me with that stupid smile on his gimpy face.I hate Tobi so much. Edit: 4 hours in I still can't activate Esim cause the application WON'T show me! And yeah I still hate Tobi. Edit2:Omg the browser is even worse!!!And FU Tobi!! | Really bad, except a balance or a possibility to upgrade there is nothing else working. Can't even update my own personal details as email, returning me constantly to a main view. For a company of the size and wealth I would expect much better quality. | The worst UX i have experienced across all Vodafone contact points not just this app. ...dead ends, poor, incomplete explanations... I usually don't write reviews but this made me | Stupid and useless | V necem prehlednejsi nez T-Mobile, ale stale pomala a nedotazena aplikace. Vlastne jen prohlizec webove samoobsluhy. Po pridani noveho cisla pod ucet a pokusu a pojmenovani na me vyskoci schvaleni cookies a pak presmerovani na uvod. Pojmenovani cisla proto nefunguje. Widget se temer neaktualizuje a to ani manualne. | Neustále nefunguje, hází chyby. Tvrdí, že mám špatný formát emailu, i když se snažím přihlásit přes service number. To samé web. Za mě je to zásadní mínus. | Too many bugs. Very slow. Not user friendly at all ! Not helpful. Very confusing,buggy and slow. Both app and website. | Kdo vymyslel aby chat bot neustále vyskakoval a vše na obrazovce zakrýval? Kolikrát je potřeba zavřít? Testoval to vůbec někdo na mobilu se zobrazenou klávesnicí? Amatéři. | Where is Vodafone 5.9.0.  In my account there is the reminder to download it othervise there is no future for me. | Very Very good | Doesnt work | Ok | This is my second review. I lowered it from 3 to 1 star as I think that Vodafone had enough time to fix this slow buggy app. Moreover, it is full of webviews that works poorly and in lot's of cases returns errors without a way out. Vodafone should do a better job and this app is just disappointing. | Still the worst app existing. Submitted dozens of technical requests on the same issue, and they close those requests without resolution. | Difficult to navigate. | Vodafone je parta ochotniku. Padesat ruznych prihlasovacich udaju a obnovit nejde nic | I cannot login because of wrong format number, but what is wrong didn't specify. Cannot change language. In web page it's much easier. I can't use this app because of login | A lot of bugs, not stable. | Další aktivní služby -> změna aktivních služeb NEFUNGUJe. Jen to hodí do stejného menu, není možné nic změnit. Lol. A to jsem si myslel že jste aplikaci od vydání už aspoň trošku zprovoznili. Ještě že jsem primárně u Kaktusu a ne u vás.. | This is a nightmare | Opravdu hnus. Sorry, ale tohle se fakt nedá. Nic tak strašného jsem od Vodafone nečekal. Pomalé, hnusné, neintuitivni. Mam ještě t-mobile a teda nebe a dudy to vám povím. Očividně to nevidím jen já ty recenze tu jsou vesměs podobné. Zajímavé, že pořád vychází aktualizace aplikace ale nějake zlepšení opravdu nevidím. Ještě že tu nemám od vás hlasový tarif (jen internet doma) jako přítelkyně. Ta je z té vaší aplikace absolutně nešťastná. | Slow, annoying, takes forever to load, always asks for a fresh login. Works for keeping track of mobile data but the experience is painful. | Nelze využívat Vodafone TV na nezabezpečené zařízení. Co? Ne funguje to | The app is bad.. Really bad. Account system and account recovery system are the worst part of it.. Fix it please | Does what I need it for. | Performance wise, it's unusable, laggy and really bad. Functionality might be ok (logging is sometimes weird), bud the performance is so terrible it basically prevents usage of the app | Worst app I've ever used. I'm a programmer myself, so I hope everyone who worked on that app will get fired. | Login does not work, app is useless. | Ja som prešiel od Tesco Mobile a som šokovaný 😱 strašnou kvalitou, nefunkčnosťou, velmi pomalou odozvou, chýbajúcimi funkciami, hrozným dizajnom... Táto appka je naozaj veľmi veľmi zle navrhnutá aj implementovaná. Príklad pre ostatné operátory ako veci nerobiť. Neviem pochopiť, ako mohol Vodafone niečo také vôbec vypustiť (alebo vôbec niekto). Hrôza. Ak ostatné služby sú tiež podobné musím od nich rýchlo preč. EDIT: ""že to může být jen o zvyku""? Zvykať si na hrôzu🤦‍♂ Čítajte hodnotenia... | Thanks for fixing the blank Top Up screen. | Terrible app, bottom menu is not working, tapping on different buttons dont work | Jako ux na nule, to dlouhy nacitani pr kazdem kliku? Spatny, hosi, spatny. | Could be better. When you set the language to English, some parts of the app still remain in Czech | Terrible | Po aktualizaci s vizuální změnou naprostá katastrofa. Odporný layout, navigace aplikací nepřehledná. Widget neaktualizuje údaje - ukazuje že zbývá 7.9/8GB ale v aplikaci je že zbývá 2.9/8GB. | Awful to | Very slow and confused | Some options are links on main Vodafone site. It's a bad UI practice. It's difficult to find chat with support | Can't even top up my phone | Slow, almost unusable. | Not intuitive, helpless. It doesn't help to set all settings fast and correctly. You have to call helpdesk. I guess, the main idea to creat this App was: ""the general marketing purpose to sell more products"", but not the UI and UX friendliness. | Can't even log in with a prepaid card.

It is an obviously poor application."",""Judging by this app alone, it is hard to believe Vodafone is a large company with sufficient resources to make a quality product. This app is extremely slow at any connection speed. It is clunky and illogical when trying to navigate or find a function to perform a specific task. It is often switching back to czech language in the most important sub menus when English is unavailable. A lot of content still unavailable in English. Not that I have a choice, but it is terrible."",""One of the worst mobile network apps I've ever witnessed and I've seen quite a few.

I am trying to access the Prepaid Bundles page and I'll I get is the endless loading sign and so I'm forced to be getting the data add-ons, since I can't choose a data package.

"Qerko","Qerko was born from our desire to make paying in restaurants, bistros and cafés easier. We didn’t want to spend any more time waiting in the queue at the bar or complicatedly separate the bill with our friends at one table.

And we pursued this smart payment system beyond gastronomy borders! Download the app, scan the QR code and easily pay with just a swipe. You will get your receipt right after payment in your e-mail and in the profile in app, too.

Registration and adding the payment method can be done in less than a minute. Qerko app represents revolution in payment, so let yourself be part of it and decide on your own, when and how you are going to pay. 

What is more, with Qerko, you can get rewards in the loyalty program too.

Benefits of the app:
• Easy pay your bill or its part in a restaurant.
• No more wasting time waiting till the waiter comes.
• Comfy payment via QR code in a restaurant or at your TV screen.
• You need only your mobile phone to pay.
• You get rewards in the loyalty program just for paying.
• Many payment methods so everyone can choose - Visa, Mastercard, meal voucher cards Edenred, Sodexo or Benefit Plus.","Qerko was born from our desire to make paying in restaurants, bistros and cafés easier.

I use this app several times a day at one specific place, but it is impossible to ""save"" the restaurant. Therefore, every time I want to pay for something I need to go through painful process of opening the camera, scanning the QR, waiting 10 seconds for the data to load and only then can I select the item. Should be one click. | amazing application. every pay Is simply with it | easy way to pay | I hate the aggressive pushing for giving a tip. You are unable to pay until you select a tip and selecting zero means four more clicks. Definitely deceptive dark ux pattern. Let users set their default tip in settings, including no tip. | Dříve fungovalo perfektně, teď najednou potřebuje instalaci a registraci a další nesmyslné osobní údaje do kterejch jim nic není... | bitcoin option rocks | Works well, even with Google Pay after a bit of initial hickups. Saves time when paying in restaurants. | its too slow, but works | Great, intuitive and simple app | Skvělá aplikace a velice mě potěšilo placení btc. Funguje to na jedničku | need an app to read the menu? your the waste of air | Great BTC/LN integration | You should let people set their own default tip. Ten per cent is not the default in reality, it should not be the default in the app either. We're not in US, tips are not mandatory and should not be expected for mediocre service. | Aplikace Qerko vám nabídne možnosti dýška evidentně inspirované v USA, počínaje 20% (kdo v ČR dává tak moc???) a doplněno smajlíky naznačujícími že cokoliv méně než 10% znamená nespokojenost. 0% ze základních možností ani nejde zvolit, musíte vybrat ""vlastní částka"". Je to absurdní, zvlášť když objednání a placení řeší aplikace. Jestli chce restaurace o 10-20% více peněz, ať zdraží, tyhle západní manýry si fakt nechte. | Nefunguje odesílání plateb na věrností kartu. Resp. odeslání se nepovede, pokud během placení dojde k potvrzení platby, volání na externí službu zřejmě expiruje. Je to škoda, pač se kvůli tomu nedají sbírat slevy za věrnost. Takže aplikace je celkem k ničemu. | I think the passive agressive smiley face when giving tips is the worst idea you could have. It only convince me not to give any tips. | Mam pocit ze casteji tu aplikaci musim aktualizovat, nez s ni platim. | App works really well. Only thing that drives me crazy is when somebody from your table goes to pay at the bar the old fashioned way, you're not able to pay by Qerko until the waiter closes your table at the bar. Sometimes they leave it open until someone else goes to pay, then you're not able to pay with Qerko at all. That gets really frustrating. | Not working with mobile network. Edit: After latest update it's working perfectly, thanks! | Cannot use cards stored in Google wallet /Google pay, even though these work in other apps without any problems. | Love the app. In my local restaurant they printed red and white qr codes. The app on my samsung cannot read it. Other qr reader apps on my samsung can read it normally. | Rychlé a dělá to co má | Hi, why it is not possible to pay by Google Pay? There is this payment option, but each time it fails. Thank you. | Fine app, but you cannot migrate your account to other device and you have poor management of receipts. QR code readability is usually very dependent on light conditions. Edit: Discounts and loyalty programme does not work sometimes. Support is fine, but could be a bit better. | Good idea but.. The need to register to another extra app is not justified for the value. If there was an option to register via Google, I would try that. But to fill the form like it's 2010? No thanks. Edit: the registration is now much more comfortable through Google auth. Raising my review from 3* to 5* | I don't understand why I need to download an app to view the menu. Very user unfriendly. | Aplikace funguje většinu času v pořádku, placení s ní je jednoduché, vybrání odměn je poněkud neintuitivní, ale nevymyslel bych to lépe. Podpora, zdá se, aktivně řeší problémy, měním tedy svou recenzi na 5*. | Stop guilting me into tipping. Tipping isn't the norm in this country, why do you add an emoji that indicates I've had a bad time when adding 0% tip? | Very nice idea, application is very smooth, makes the payments faster, hope more business to adapt the application. | I doesn't even open | Marketingová sdělení a aplikace běžící na pozadí i když ji nepoužívám?? Co to má ksakru znamenat? Tohle bych od platební appky teda vážně nečekal. | Aplikace mi nenabizi platbu pres google pay... koncim na CSOB platebni brane... asi nejaka chyba, kamaradum funguje | Great app, quick payment, no need to wait for anyone to pay the bill in a restaurant. | Awesome service. I use it any time I see it in a restaurant. | WOW, this needs to be everywhere. It saves so much time and hassle. Once you are ready to leave, just scan the QR/NFC, pick which items you want to pay (great it you are e.g. splitting a bill), pay wit your card / GPay etc. (you can also leave a tip), and walk away. No need to get the waiter's attention and wait for them to come and let you pay. They can have more time to do things where they bring value where apps can't - welcoming guests, helping them pick the meal, bringing an order. | Proč mně nutí přidávat platební metodu za když chci zaplatit? A stejně nrjsem schopen zaplatit. Až po chvíli jsem pochopil, že musím posunout šípku zleva doprava. Bez jakekoliv nápovědy. Proč nestačí kliknout na zaplatit? | Add Bitcoin (BTC, BCH) payments support for 5 stars please :) | Ze zacatku, fungovala dobre, pak obcas ne, zejmena problem s gpay, musel jsem zmenit zpusob platby. Obcas jsem i tak nezaplatil, coz bylo neprijemne, zvlast,kdyz jsem nemel hotovost. Jindy jsem zaplatil pres apku, ale i kdyz se mi platba blokovala v bance, neprojevila se v restauraci. Mel jsem cca 3 tydny blokovane prostredky v bance, pritom jsem musel platit v hotovosti. Kdyby fungovala bez problemu, tak super. Sanci jeste dam. | Aplikace automaticky nenápadně předvyplňuje 10% spropitné. Když ho vypnete, nepamatuje si to a dalši objednavku ho tam hodí znovu. Za mě je to úmysl - snaze o pohodlí uživatele težko věřit, tou by bylo aspoň pamatovat si předchozí volbu. Za mě je to trošku podvod na zákazníka a aplikace, které se mě snaži nachytat, v telefonu z principu nechci. Pokud někomu chci dát spropitné, úmyslně mu ho dám (nebo lépe nechám na stole hotovost). Pokud mu ho dat nechci, nechci myslet na to ho v aplikaci rušit. | Edit: I missed Google Pay si far, but it was recently added. I'm looking forward to try it out. | Fix the missing possibility to add a card from gpay automatically. No popup shows, so the card number must be entered manually, thats frustrating. | Nefunkční. Nelze přidat edenred kartu. | Today I tried to use the app and it was faulted. 2 purchases and 2 days (due to public holidays) remained before loyalty conditions will be satisfied. It's very strange. I'm gonna put aside the app for a while. | Doesn't support Google pay, requires registration, too complicated | Adding payment method fails for 3 cards and two banks. Does not support google pay. Basically useless. Fortunately, I could pay with my phone using NFC and the account this app would not accept. Edit: seems it was only some sort of down time. I would like to see google pay/account integration for Android users. Stars increased to 4. | Good idea, working smoothly, cool app. | Google Pay is missing | Why I have add card if I have Google Pay?! | Unable to establish (a) secure connection = unusable | What is this, vigorous really vigorous | Fantastic! We'll, would be great if you also add a possibility to order. | It was a great app, until it forgot my Visa details. Now the 3D Secure gateway doesn't load in the app correctly, so can't re-add it UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2020: Suddenly I'm able to add cards again, rating adjusted | Nápad je super, ale - nemožnost použití Google autentizace a taktéž chybějící integrace s Google Pay je celkem zásadní problém | Good UI. Requires creating account (okay) and entering/linking card details (wrong). I would rather be redirected to payment gateway and leave the rest on my OS/phone. Update: Card info is not stored, great! | Cool idea, I'd love to see this in more bars and restaurants. Good luck | Works great! Would appreciate support of google pay. Maybe ordering of food/drinks sometime in future? | Dobrý napad, vse funguje skvěle. Šel by vylepšit onboarding platební karty např. naskenování fotoaparátem.

They have no human support. A mere hours after I made order I started getting scam texts. | Cool | 💚 | Мне все нравится. Но только можете пожалуйста добавить чехлы для телефона Oscal C70. Спасибо 🙏💕! | So the app itself is AWESOME. But... Now there is a bug for me. Nothing shows up when clicking my orders,my cart etc. Please check it out. Overall 10/10. | excellent service | 💯 | Horrible customer service! And horrible program. I have been trying to cancel my delivery, and nobody is answering me either on the program or on email. What kind of online program doesn't have a cancellation button or a way for customers to contact the seller to cancel the order. | Good | Great website, great value for money, quality clothing | Rudely dismissive customer service, absurdly high prices along with ridiculous time frame for delivery. Don't waste your time and money. | I have had problems with codes but this is the first time I have used you if it all straight forward I will be back | jooooooom ! | terrible shipping. Ordered just a shirt in december and it said will arrive in january and im still waiting like 2 month. almost 3 | Good value for money. | Я дуже вибираю Япония Корея меі ближче, атож | 👍 | Everything ive bought has been cheaply made tat not worth the cost | 👍 | Very good allways deliver | it's all are very slow process, even showing in shipped condition but when I tried to track my order with given I'd its not at all...I paid 268$ for my order on 27 Jan 23..today I am sitting on 11 th Feb and no idea where is my order...I contacted c.care multiple times and got to know that they are looking but no resolution after 15+ days, am really very disappointed with service and response and now I am realizing that I think I lost my 268 dollars..edited my rate to 3. Wl make 5 once received. | The best app | It takes a month for the products to arrive but its worth it | Totally disappointed, was long time customer but recently incerun take orders used my money and after week's they cancelled order and asking again to buy the same product with higher prices, and while wanted help from joom, its horrible, but before their support was really wonderful. | Customer service is great.. I had a problem with a store Within 24hrs they refunded my money back.. | Very bad experience joom first my order accept after 6 days cancel and not refund me .I suggest don't use this app | The delivery is very Bad i didnt get any product that i order | Good | Good value for money but taking a very long time to arrive | good | I love Joom and I can't wait to buy things off here. | good quality and Good service | I love Joom been using it for years i have over 150 purchases but the thing thats bothering me is that on check out it says 143,15 BAM but they charge me 150,12 BAM which is not ok so basically the coupon i used was 'fake' | One star taken off for the following: Far from the greatest variety of products in all categories, a lot of just overbuying. Long delivery time, even with tracking. Delivery time can vary from the original. | I find everything | good | Wonderful App!! I'd love it if some packages didn't end up damaged, however. | Satisfide | The worst shopping app ever. You should not order anything from here if you don't want to wait at least 45 days (and still have not receive my order). The support team chat does absolutely nothing to help. They don't even know when will you gonna get what you paid for or the name of the delivery company of your parcel. The tracking code is not working either. If you can't sort out the delivery service, you better shut down this app. I would give this 0 star or even minus if there is an option. | I placed several orders and I still haven't received them...this program has no management...you can't even track your order problems...if you want to waste your money, definitely order products from this program. | I have used this App for years. Delivery times are better and products are from around the world. The variety of things and prices are great. I would highly recommend Joom. | Shipping takes way to long you never know if you will ever get your order from them | Very good | please give me my order on the time | congrats to the programmers | I don't know I never stay baying here | Really bad delivery service item due for Xmas its the end if Jan and still hasn't arrived no tracking available since the 15th of Dec and I need to wait untill the 22/02/24 to claim refund | Used to be amazing I have used for years however the last three orders have been terrible first one wasn't even what I ordered, second didn't arrive and the last one I ordered a pair of trainers, after 8 days still said assembling I contacted joom and they said not to worry it was probably just they hadn't updated. Scroll on and low and behold no trainers and the seller has cancelled the order ! I will receive money back they offered 10% off voucher, you get that daily anyways 🙄🙄 | pretty good | Good | I used to love buying stuff from here every week. Their prices in the last 2 to 3 years went up like 90%. I used to be able to get watches for like $2.50. Now there are $91 for the same watches. I thought OK they would be like 5 or $6. You know, prices increased but seriously. These are off brand junkie. Things that you know you get around Christmas time. They have the box sets that are like 10 bucks and stores. So I was getting a bargain, but this is ridiculous. This is a rip off whoever a chi | It's don't connect network.. | good | I will leave a review once I get the goods | poor app. takes time for your orders to arrive. poor quality products sold in this app. | I love Joom's gadgets & great prices. I find items on Joom I can get elsewhere. | I am still waiting for my orders and so unhapoy wjth your company as ive still not rwcieved them have been waiting for months now and very disapionted with joom i will no longer be buying from you | Too slow. Some of support consultants have an awful behavior. | Takes too long to be delivered | Good abb | Fast and accurate. | Disappointed | nice | Great service | Not bad value for what you get. | Good | More than 95% off products are just gone. Example, when I search for the word ""tactical"" I only get like 10 results compared to the 100s of 1000s of results I usually got. One day lots of products, next day almost everything gone. | Ordered a bunch of stuff which were meant to be delivered today but haven't received them yet. The app is now bugged and won't open even after deleting and reinstalling it. So I haven't had a good experience, but hey, it costs nothing for delivery and is cheaper as hell, so I can't expect much. Update: I received the items a few days late but did receive them. So I bumped up a star. | Good products and good delivery for Cyprus | Fantastic 👍🏾 | Great products @ Great Prices will deffo buying more products | Great service, and customer care, their service chat system is fantastic and they are quick with replying to help you. I had a broken controller and they where more than helpful | Happy | It is so good! 👍 | jggoh | They didnt refund my money,they dont update product location | I love shopping from Joom | interested 👍 | TOO PRICEY MOOObe time | Joom is a very good company. I have been shopping from joom long time and I am very happy | AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Sent me settee covers did not match the description or photos, all mismatched in size and branding, and they were incredibly negligent and cheeky throughout the returns process, demanding I take photos and videos of me handing them into a charity shop before giving me my refund. They even blocked communication at one point, resulting in my son having to download the app to reach them. I do have my money back now but they are incredibly rude, and a complete sham. | Excellent communication with customer service ..if any questions...reasonable delivery...had 2 orders up to now and I am pleased.. thank you ❣️ | Joom, Shopping like King 👑 I recommend It to the international consument | excellent | ჰბჰ | Great choice of products and so easy to order | good prices | always shop on joom...prices really good... | it's cool I liked, m | great value | Very very late delivery, to much waiting | like | good | i truly love this app | I noticed prices are more expensive and from my personal experience some sellers are scammers giving a false description of their items and when you complain with c/care they offer you some refund but keep these sellers on joom platform scamming other buyers and cheating other honest sellers | Its an amazing app i ordered a lot of stuff and they deliver faster than expected the prices are unimaginably cheap nike AF1 for 28€ thats a steal for sure. However almost everythibg is fake so keep that in mind. | Great prices and fast delivery. The best shopping app by far... | perfect | Good price and quick delivery | Į wanted to order some clothes my money gone but order dont go trough scammers :Dd | awesome app | It always does a good job with my purchase | Destul de util | very exclusive | this is a site where quality doesn't come with a big price tag | wicked little app good selection. | shop evrybadys home town come to shop hire is amazing thanks | avery good | Im still waiting for items i ordered in oct and nov 2023 ..it says my expiray date is expired.. | Don't use very often | Hi.i need blac hand beg.30 bax praiz | Ok | Still waiting for my order | nice | This is not good just wast ur money and time i have everything for this application thay making drama | no problem shopping with Joon and paying was easy just think it's a bit long for delivery | Poor delivery service and very disappointed. | probably would buy more if shipping was quicker | good | really nice products at at great price | I love this app, offers useful things for best proces and best quality possible, definitely 5 stars, keep up. | Always good value for money.Never a wrong item yet in 6 orders. Delivery free to your mailbox 30€ + Bit of a long wait but worth it. | Clothing displayed in ad does not appear after directed shopping click. | Very Happy | It's fantastic application | WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE, AND WILL BE HAPPY TO BUY FROM JOOM AGAIN ☆☆☆☆☆ | excellent 👍 | easy to shop for what you want without having to queue up at stores | Good | Why only credit? | This company was supposed to be rated with 0 stars. I want to return a product that's defective but they've asked countless times to send a video of the product and its operation which I did but they're still not satisfied with the videos that I've been sending them. They just don't want to accept that the product is faulty and they don't want me to return it!!!!! | You can find most good stuff cheap in price | unable to get a response from the CHAT FOR SUPPORT | Joom is very kind and nice and the products are very good x | Joom app does not allow Indian address. It says India region not available. Very disappointing. I wanted to buy Cubot Pocket 3 mobile.

Imposible to access since I couldnt set a User Name durign registration The dump part is: there is no option to put a USERNAME durign the registration process. | It is a terrible app, I have registered and when I try to insert my username and email is just keeps stating unexpected error, terrible app and non existent support | Very non-intuitive ""transfer"" of account. Anyways, survived trough it, only to get to the screen' you must agree to our privacy policy' . Read trough it. Uninstalled the app right after it. Never going to agree to this! Edit: I wroite in English. They replied in Czech. And on top: their answer has nothing to do with my comments and concerns on the privacy ! | Guys, are you serious? So you made rebranding, and after that, I need to spend half an hour logging in again? Who are your PR and IT managers? You need new ones :) It will be good with IQ more than 50 at least | Jumped through a million hoops to finally log into my account and now u can't get through the phone number verification setup. I did it twice, all the way to entering the code u sent and it just throws me back to the start. I hope your company goes bankrupt so someone more capable can take over. | Very buggy, laggy, doesn't connect most times, always changing login methods to go through loops of connections that doesn't make sense. Badly designed app. | Not accessible!! | Nefunguje, jsem jen zaseklá na uvítací stránce... | Když musím na záložce účtů hledat své účty mezi reklamou, tak mi přijde, že Sodexo už kleslo hodně hluboko a nikde nemůžu najit placenou verzi aplikace bez reklamy 🤔 | Unable to login to my account with my company email. No problem with login on PC but in the app it is impossible. | Dear team, Please work more on UI and make it user friendly in terms of content that you show us. Button, cards, and overall looks like 5 years back design. So please improve. Thank you | Funguje přesně tak jak má, platby také funkční. | Nevím proč, ale nelze přistoupit k sodexo connect link. Zkoušel jsem mockrát ale bez úspěchu. Je to móc nepříjemné vzhledem k tomu že není možné sledovat stav účtu. Jsem správně registrován na nový connect system. Update: Den který jsem psal komentář, vůbec mi ne nabízelo aktualizovat aplikace a měl jsem poslední aktuální verze. A do mobilu samozřejmě používám Chrome browser. Teď už funguje přístup. | I am mad with your last update, it completely ruined the bearly working buggy app. Change yor security architect. I am truly sorry my company forces me to use your service, if this can ne a service at all. | Excellent app. Has two screens. On 1st you have Login Sodexo Connect button which brings you to Welcome screen with Continue button (why🤦‍♂️?) which brings you back to the Login Sodexo Connect screen. Fun! My cards didn't work over the weekend, couldn't login to web or mobile app. On Monday I was able to reach the helpline. Today login page down for maintenance. Now it's back and my card doesn't work, can't login to mobile app, only the webapp. Updating your SW after Xmas party, or? | Update: No a to je právě ten problém. Kvalitní aplikace to umí přepnout do češtiny i na systému v jiném jazyce. Původní hodnoceni: Na systému s angličtinou nelze přepnout do češtiny?! | It's not able to let me log in, at all it's been already for 1, the same. No change at all, and customers service it zero, they are replying to the emails, after almost 2weeks. Very bad. | Since it has moved to sodexo connect the saved account gets forgotten and cached in the browser. It's easy to log out accidentally and the app tried to include virtual card payment which conflicts with Google wallet. That feature should just be dropped in favor of allowing the card to be added to Google wallet directly. Also the amount of commercials make the app fully of useless information. | Proc mi ztezujete pristup k mym, nikoliv vasim penezum? Sodexo connect nechci nepotrebuji. Jedine co chci je widget ktery mi ukaze zustatek na katre aby vam nic neuvizlo za nehty. Tim ze prostredky ktere jste kvuli legislative nazvali kredity a tim je lze zcela legalne nechat propadnout. Na co aplikace? Proc tohle delate? | Existuje snad ještě hloupější aplikace než je tahle? Vůbec nic to neumí a akorát s tím jsou problémy a teď už ani ta jedna jediná funkce, ke které to šlo využít, tak nefunguje.. no lol. | It doesn't let me login, however the account works on the websit. | You have to switch to the card section of the app to use NFC which is very annoying. | now I cannot login. invalid email address. we do not even know when it will work again...that is not so great support | They made the app even more complicated. Now I need even a 2nd account called Sodexo Connect to check my balance. | Ruined by the ""Sodexo Connect"", you have to create this Sodexo Connect account even thou you alredy have the account at Sodexo. Waist of time just to check the balance. I don't need nor want this app while you still can check it online thru web. | Naprosto příšerný systém přihlášení, udělal jsem si ten nový účet a propojil si ho se starým a když se přihlásím tak se to bez asistence webu neobejde. Hrůza | Nejenom, že aplikace začala požadovat 2FA, ale taky se pravidelně odhlašuje. Takže sice můžu bankovní účet s hodněcifernými částkami v CZK, USD a čemkoliv jiném spravovat jen přes otisk prstu, ale Sodexo, kde mám směšných 1400 na stravenkách a 600 na flexipasech mám zabezpečený jak Pentagon. Paráda! | I cannot log in. On PC(web) account works fine. Just horrible app as the Sodexo app for card NFC payments | Po upgrady se nelze prihlasit, system nezna email ani tel. | After years of nonproblematic use i cannot login - ""unknown email address"" yet using the same on web page works fine! | Nebyl jsem s aplikací spokojen nijak zvlášť ani před posledním updatem, ale po poslední aktualizaci je to ještě výrazně horší. Integrování placení do jedné aplikace? Na papíře ok. Realita - ""vyžadováno opětovné přihlášení"" u každého nákupu a než se proklikam všemi kroky, tak to trvá víc jak půl minuty/minutu, což ve frontě všichni oceňují. Slíbená integrace do Google Pay nikde, zatímco Apple Pay funguje už měsíc a půl... Bez reakce při odeslání emailu na podporu. | It doesn t let me log in! Everytime totally forgeting my account set up and asking me to register again although I have an account and saved it for easy log in. I have to uninstall and install again. Then it finds my account. But next time the same issue! Is it that complicated to program such an app?! | good | Why doesn't it allow me to log in and says that email address doesn't exist, when I can log in without any issues on the website? Why did it wipe my log in credentials after update and doesn't allow me to log in cause problem mentioned above? | Why they made ti so complicated now... why do i need some new account, why do they want my mail and phone number, why does the password need special character, why I can't log in anyway.... why make things more and more conplicated... | How can we have mobile payments for Android users please? | Overly complicated. | After using the app on Android, I installed the app to my iPhone, just to have an apple pay on my secondary mobile device. Now, it seems like I can no longer use the app on the android, after enabling apple pay. Is that correct? I can't login to Android app. Or am I doing something wrong? | Jedna aplikace na placení, jiná na přehled a nejde to dát do google pay. Otřes | Works ok. Nothing special, nothing bad :) | Aplikaciou nie je mozne platit alebo pridat kartu do google pay | Please put sodexo in the name of the app! I hate to use play store to open it... Add the ability to hide accounts that are not being used | 1) Sodexo personal account and 2) Sodexo mobile payment should be placed on one app. | Can't use a bit older app. Forced update | Inconvenient UI of the app. When you are on the page for reporting problems, it is impossible to switch between CZ & EN versions. The message with the reported problem is sometimes cannot be sent, the reason is not clear. It is impossible to attach images to the message from user to Sodexo. | Good | Pin reset doesn't give notification, the pin won't be available for unclear amount of time and card is unusable. | All fine, but missing dark mode. | Používal som aplikáciu cez rok. Posledný mesiac ale vôbec nefunguje (chyba pripojenia k serveru). | When I'm trying to log in, I always get a message ""Server is not responding, try again later"" for past couple of days. | Barely usable due to the amount of self promotions and commercials which take 90% of the screen. After the last update is hard for me to even identify where among the all commercials and spam I can see my actual accounts. Disgusting. | Pretty good but it could be better | Cannot connect to the server. I have tried multiple times from different networks. | The dev is right. Touch ID works but may need a data and cache reset! | Poslouží. | Ježíš co to je za jméno? Jak to mám asi najít v seznamu aplikací? Proč se to nejmenuje prostě ""Sodexo""? Nebo aspoň ""Sodexo osobní účet""? Takhle to podle abecedy nenajdu. Ještě přidejte na začátek ""Můj"" a bude to nejhorší název ze všech. Omg why is Czech name ""Personal account Sodexo""? How am I supposed to find it in the drawer sorted by alphabet? Can't you rename it to have word Sodexo first? The only thing missing to make it the worst name ever is adding ""My"" at the beginning. | Po dnešní aktualizaci, nefunkční. Android 12 | OneMenu I tried to order finally with OneMenu inside your application and it was soooo complicated. When I finally made the order and paid, then after 5 min restaurant replied that they are not accepting this order. I will rather go and use Wolt. | Great app | Not the worst app but not the best either | Velký špatný. Velmi špatné vyhledávání, nemožnost získat detail nebo i jenom jméno pokud jsou dvě provozovny na jedné adrese, celkově tragické ovládání. | Nechápu k čemu to je, když inzerují podniky, které na místě karty neberou. Vyhozené peníze | Working great. | Automatic one star review for harassing me to review the app. | Nepoužitelné. Mapa sama o sobě nic nezobrazuje, je potřeba filtrovat, některé body se v mapě i při přiblížení zobrazí jako číslo a ne jako konkrétní provozovny, vyhledávání je otřesné, neobsahuje detaily a nepodporuje ověření obličejem. Už prosím ty šílené stravenky zrušte. | It doesn't support widgets, it will be nice to see balance without open the app. | all good | pretty good | Always I have to search for things and how to do stuff. It's not user friendly at all. | Aplikace nefunguje. Nelze se přihlásit. | Leasiure account is not consistent, companies official support also admitting that they wrote here misinformation. | A COMPLETELY useless filter and search engine for places where you can pay with the flexi pass card. Naprosto nepouzitelne vyhledavani mist a firem, kde se da platit flexi pass kartou. | I have to give one star for Sodexo in general as when you are given a new card (I changed the employer), you need to create a completely new account to be able to use the new card. | It's fine, but there is a bug, that ""today remaining"" parameter does not take into account the actual balance. The ""today remaining"" could show greater amount than the balance. | Terrible app, the search function is appalling, there is no way to get a proper list displaying in spite of the filter, no access to voucher ordering, nor primary account information. Just horrible. | Neposílají stravenky (peníze) včas, někdy i o 2 týdny pozdě. Je to na prd, nedá se na ně spolehnout. | The app contains tons of advertisement with no ability to turn them off or hide. Very annoying. | Awful app - crashes, does not work | Nefunfuje, zrušit. | terrible app together with mobilni platby, wont let you pay unless selected as default method and app actually opened, no Gpay support...not worth installing, stick to physical card and web account if you can | Sometimes works but sometimes withoyt any reason I cannot pay with this app - in the I need to carry the plastic card. It makes the app useless. And the fact that you split the functionality that should be kept in a single app into 2 useless apps makes things even worse. I would give 0 stars if it was possible. | refund not received in 30 days. Poor support. | It stopped working 1month ago. It does not see the internet connection anymore.

Also, there are no options for up/down seek, only a single slider. Update Mar-020: broken Chromcast support!!! Update Mar-2021: User interface much improved, problems with broken chromecast solved.

Z nepochopitelného důvodu odebrali funkčnost v Live Channels u AndroidTV. Říkají že o problému neví i když v poslední době k tomu zde mají více záporných hodnocení. Problém prý nehodlají řešit a jakkoliv opravovat. Jejich originální aplikace na android TV je pomalá a zbytečně složitá na ovládání. | Love | Chromecast fixed in 2.7.3 | Chromecast playback broken in last update.

Could you please look into it? Thank you. | Top | Super | najlepsia appka na pozeranie tv | Po posledním updatu přestala pracovat integrace s Live Channels. | The only way how to move forward/backward is to drag the slider which is very uncomfortable. There should be a better way e.g. double tap like in YouTube. | Good app | Neumí pokračovat od posledního místa, kam už bylo přehráno, a to nejen time shifting, ale dokonce ani nahrávky, což mi přijde divné. Jinak pecka. | Aplikace v pohodě, ale chybí volba jazyka, myšleno originální znění u dabovaných filmů. Chybí taktéž vyhledávání pořadů dle názvu. Taková ta malá lupa.

Funguje skvelo. :-) | Apka je sice skvělá a měl jsem ji rád, ale po posledním updatu to po mě vyžaduje opakovaně vyťukávat na mobilu login, kdykoliv se ztratí připojení. V podstatě jsem to přestal používat, připadám si teď jak Sisyfos. EDIT: Už je to v pořádku, zvedám hodnocení. Ještě bych ocenil, kdyby se šlo v čase posouvat jemněji, to pravítko dole je dost nepřesné. | Works fine. Happy with the app. | I like it | Good | Málo kanálů zdarma. Cena je mnohem vyšší, než jsem očekával. | Dobře funguje pro sledováníTV na dovolené. Bohužel přepnutí kanálu do originálního zvuku mi nejde (ani u těch málo, co to nabízí), přitom na PC ano. | Can't complain | Nejlepsi apka. Diky | Money grabb | Great IPTV client | Dobrá apka. Konečně podpora chromecast. Ještě bych uvítal přenos zvuku přes 
bluetooth (v autě) | Zdarma jsou jen 9 programů za ostatní musíš platit | Konecne chromecast :))) | Trochu rozporuplná aplikace, na jedné straně poskytuje přístup k iptv ale připadá mi dost nestabilní. Používám ji na nvidia SHIELD tv a musím konstatovat častou padavost aplikace. Bylo by tedy fajn zlepšit stabilitu. | Terrible | Ok for IPTV, but should have cast support. | Needs Chromecast support. | Vůbec to nefunguje. Zaregistrovat a pak to napíše někdo už použil tvůj kód. Tak dík. | Přehrávání občas přestane fungovat bez udání důvodu a někdy se orientace obrazovky zasekne ve vertikálním směru a nejde to změnit. Na druhou stranu program vysílání je zvládnutý skvěle. | Oproti ""OLD"" verzi je mnohem obtiznejsi prepinani programu na Android TV bez bezdratove mysi.

Každopádně aspoň, že na PC to funguje jak má. | Aplikace je super ale skoda ze je platena. | Dobré | Mě to funguje perfektně. Jenom se těším až to bude k dispozici na mé android TV Sony. Děkuji. | Poměrně dobrá aplikace, zásadní problém je ale, že neumí odesílat obraz například na chromecast, nebo chytrou TV. | Finally supported! Thanks. | Doesn't play | Výborný koncept. Funguje jak má. Pouze v Android 6 zatím stále nepřehrává. Výborná by byla podpora Chromecastu. | Nic moc, vela kanalov je zamknutých | Hugh | Nelze ovládat hlasitost při vynuceném horizontálním zobrazení... | Nic viac ako 3 programy nejdu dokonca ani ct | Jedna z appek co vážně funguje | Velice dobre, dobry bonus pro zakazniky podporovanych operatoru.

LOVE IT | My experience is well and amazing as well o think it needs more to the art and stuff. | I love it . It's easy to use . It's just perfect | Nice | Ive used this app for several years on my tablet, its really good and so simple to use. Sometimes it unexpectadly closes when I want to save my images to my phone, and the tool to specifically move a certain part of the picture sometimes doesnt work and ends up moving the picture the wrong way than the direction I pointed to- but overall I really like it. | Best app of all time it's a GOAT, it literally kills ibis paint in everything literally everything | Good app | Nice app | Crashes on opening | I do like the brushes it can offer but the app always had an error. I cannot go back on my artworks even if my phone doesn't had a problem or I saved my last work. It doesn't matter what gadget I use I always encounter the same problem. You could better improve it.

It's really good for edits and just random drawings.

You have to agree to a license agreement just to use it, and I don't see any warning of that in the description, or that the free version is limited to Ten Days. I do not appreciate companies that don't tell you the trial is limited (and how) BEFORE you take the time, effort, and possible cost of downloading and installing their product. Or the actual cost should you want to buy it. Info like that should be UP FRONT, NOT HIDDEN. | Nafiz | Used to be a fine app but the last few days, it's been so laggy and overheats the phone. Frustrating to use. It's like the creators don't care anymore. Guess it's high time I figured out how to use Hi Paint instead | This would be 5 stars but this latest update has absolutely ruined it. Parts or all of my sketches are missing. I just lost half a days work even though it was saved. And the app keeps freezing. Please fix this now! | Savren Kumar | Seem. Seem | good | I was looking for a replacement for Ibis PaintX, and this was perfect. | Old version was good but nowadays it loss picture quality | Very good app | Nice app | It's good | Have the developers ever considered adding accounts to this program.

Nope, no logic whatsoever in the menu bar, as usual, it just draws a random line and a random curve as default behavior. I miss when you were able to open an app and paint a box.

I only used it for a little while because I wanted to find my favorite and this one was by far the best. Everything works great and there are a ton of options so that it fits your needs. My only complaint is that its kind of difficult to navigate at first. | Ahiran Bhai | It's one of the best art apps I've used! All of the tools I want to use are free and there are so many tools to choose from. I highly recommend this app for digital artists if you can't afford the other apps! | Very nice app 🥰😇 | It's pretty nice for technical sketches, etc. But I just paid the $2 for premium, and now it's crashing when I try to open the layers overlay. | I have had this app across my devices for at least 9 years. It has improved dramatically and is very underrated. It's free without ads, has hundreds of customizable brushes, can open/export as PSD files, you can use several layers, grid & ruler tools, can import images, has a stroke stabalizer, etc. As long as this app never ends up charging me or gets rid of all the features I love, then I will use this to the end of my days. Its great for all art styles and rendering styles. | My absolute favorite app for sketching and painting digitally. Easy to use, a nice range of mediums, and a comfortable interface (everything is placed perfectly and organized well) make this my favorite digital sketchbook. It has always been reliable (little to no lagging unlike other apps I've tried) and high-resolution on saving, giving me the ability to make my own wallpapers and backgrounds. Thank you for freeing me to just play with art in an easy-to-use way that puts the fun in function. | Great app for coloring asf but can you please fix the white squares that keep popping up? It's getting rather annoying. | Amazing | V. Good👍 | Paid for premium version and CAN NOT dl any of the features. Support was no help at all and basically blamed me for their app not working.

I'm still unclear about the Cut, Trim, and Split functions, those terms are FAR too vague... and they are very difficult to use. The instructions are absolutely useless.

Super clumsy interface."",""Super cool app, I really love all the free features - Adds are very smooth and dont bother - for a song or other feature to unlock the adds are super easy going.

Very great work!! (:"",""Pretty awesome when it works. Within the lats month or two I began having consistent issues with an audio/video synchronization bug: making (or even undoing/redoing) any type of change can trigger an audio delay, and while often making another change will fix it, it's maddening.

I make videos up to 5 minutes long, have done so for years and never had any problems with it so I bought the pro version. Then, after a few months the quality has dropped. It glitches, saves with a grainy blurry tone, buffers during production and has now become a chore to use rather than a pleasure.

We're trying to teach our boys to speak properly and this app doesn't help. The grammar is attrocious and annoying. Stop trying to be cool and use normal language. | Very detailed vs book | very helpful | I want to be like tomorrow I want to be like them | Amazing | Awesome | Very nice app | sometimes it crashes for no reason, but overall good experience | awesome | So no Midgard, Pyramid, Medieval or interesting sets... Waste of time to set up an account. | 🤣💖 | Great game | had the app crash a few times during builds, but it saves your progress, so that's nice! also, being able to move the builds around so you can see exactly where they go is lovely! | The best app! | It helped when there was a different part and I had to find it and I and I found and it is cool and helpful. | This app is amazing. Having the ability to zoom in and rotate some instructions is so helpful. I would love to see the full library of every set ever produced available. Even as a paid service. | it is so cool to be able to have all the building instructions in one place | The coolest app ever | this app is extremely useful for beginning lego builders | 3rd and the other one I have been working on it andggg fwwssse | we have been looking to find old instruction books for older legos. | i love to play lego and using my device to show the lego instructions. this is the best tablet in the world. | Pretty slick and nice to see steps from all angles. It is a bit buggy. I could not rate sets at the end. Bag numbering/order from sets can differ from instructions. | afol who loves lego | much easier to understand than the packet | Helps a lot to see where pieces go. | I like this game because i'm a lego fan | it is very helpful if you don't have the physical manual | I love playing with my LEGO with my son | Awesome app, highly recommended for any lego fans. | UwU | This app drains device batteries FAST!! Caused my pixel tablet to go from 95% charge to 2% charge before completing a build. Ended up using the paper instructions anyway. Similar experience on LG phone, except the phone overheated as well. Damaged the battery. If Lego doesn't want to include printed instructions in order to reduce their carbon footprint, that's great - kudos! But what's wrong with existing technology? Include a QR code on the first bag to download pdf instructions. | Won't scan QR codes. Not sure why, but it never scans the qr codes. Nothing happens. It just sits on the camera screen. | I'm not going to be able to get up at night | great app | Very optimistic! | very useful for lego builds and anything like that | Would pay good money if i could build it on the app with the instructions. Please. | Really cool | Won't let me login | Amazing | it's so fun :) | Awesome | Excellent set for kids. | Just one problem, the instructions are too dark. It's hard to distinguish the colors. Would be nice if you could lighten them. Love how it lists my sets by theme with set number vs online pdf instructions with different numbers. I can have inventory and piece counts for my collections, 3D is helpful and fun when available. Some are not 3D. | my son loves it, he now has 2 | Overall pretty good, does need to be optimized a little better. They also do need to add more older sets, and with that, make the instructions like the newer sets. | Awesome! | This app is awesome!!! | love lego and this app is full proof | good site | This is amazing. Makes it so the kid can do it without me helping. | Pathetic after sales services, they just gives u mail that they are providing the missing parts, but the missing part never arrive at ur door step | useful 👍 | this is just fun! the animation is great! | My kid loves this he is having a great time on this game. | even better than manual instructions and much easier to follow | Great when it works. Occasionally kicks me out of the app and going back into it will make you lose your place. | There are multiple sets missing. As an example I own set 40647, but can't find it in the app. Is there a reason for this? I would've liked to be able to add all sets that I own to my collection. Thanks | really good if you can't find the instruction thx you for making this app and what is the prize for making a lego acount | The app has crashed very occasionally, and it consumes your battery like no-one's business, but it's an astonishingly good app overall. There are instructions for older sets, which are just the original instructions cut up. But for newer sets, you can do build parties with friends (not tried myself), and the instructions allow for rotating the image to get a better view, as well as flagging potential mistakes regarding similar pieces (eg wings that have different orientations). | being able to see the steps in 3D has made building a lot easier than using the booklet. | Does exactly as described. No complaints here. | I like the app it's great to be able to use for instructions. Disappointed with the fact that a number of sets even new sets bought recently (such as Roses 40460) are missing. Would be good if able to even custom add old sets or sets not included. | awesome | Great build with nice minifigs | this is far better tool to use than the book. love it | Great app, Works wonders for compleating complex Lego projects! | very helpful with directions | I find using the instructions on my tablet soooo much easier than having a flimsy manual where it constantly wants to go closed and find yourself losing where you are half the time. In other words, it's awesomeness 😍 | awsome, way more detailed than the paper instructions | What a great App. User-friendly. Makes seeing the colours a lot easier than the printed books sometimes do. | it's amazing! | nice 💀 | It looks alright but the instructions are very weird and some of the pieces change places! 2 stars. 😕 | it helps you build and it is really helpful to see which peices to use | amazing, such a good idea | This app is so nostalgic! I absolutely love being able to go back through the years and view instructions to Lego sets I grew up with as a kid! It also provides up-to-date content for future generations to enjoy, which is also great. 5 stars from me! | It keeps crashing while I attempt to build the typewriter | this one is awesome | I love it | Is bad does not even let u build it is trash | this app is awesome | I always love to build | Always awesome | it's really helpful to use and I won't lose my place so thanks for this I NEED IT | cool 😎 | this app is absolutely amazing when it works. it allows my 4 year old to independently work on very complicated sets. unfortunately it's not very reliable. when opening the app, it frequently gets stuck in the three bricks loading circle. when loading the instructions, it also could get stuck in the loading circle. I've had to uninstall and install multiple times to make progress. | Bad | Good but glitches here and there | windowful | Like the simple design, the way of Archiving every Set I've ever bought. I have only found 1 flaw and that is that the Catalogue isn't up to date. I have 4 Sets lying around that I recently got and none of them are in the App Catalogue. But other than that, great app. | It has mixels. Need I say more? | Fixed the random closures. The window that shows the pieces needed for that step is always getting in the way & you either have to keep opening & closing it or zooming in & out, it's annoying. | it's a bit slow when explaining | Amazing. But can we get mini racers added? Can't find them online and would like to start a collection of those with other pieces. Please and thank you | helps very good | I love the app it helps alot | I love this app😃 | This app helps me to build my Lego sets when I don't want to use the manuals. I'm not saying that manuals are bad to include, I'm just saying, it's fun to have another way to build the sets that i have. Really great system, Lego! | I used to fart in the pool, then trying to swim under water and sniff it. | very detailed and able to rotate around build to see better angles if some piece placement is confusing. | easy to follow and hugely useful if your terrible at keeping the manuals | not much to do | BRILLIANT, Although this build is very repetitive which I knew before purchasing, I decided to take my time and in doing so it doesn't seem so repetitive. Within the instructions at the beginning it tells you the history of the Eiffel Tower and throughout the instructions their are facts about certain things relating to the tower. I also purchased some French Lego minifigures to stand on the base. Also I have purchased Eiffel's apartment which is a retired item from an online site to go with it. | i love lego | Great and practical since you can rotate the bricks zoom in n stuff | It's good😊 | This is an app to view 3D instruction, NOT to build the lego set, but still a very decent app | I wish you could just build your own things and save the instructions through this. However, its a great app with fairly simple navigation and excellent execution. | I accendently deleted this but amazing galing love the new ninjago such a fan | Excellent | legoforeevvaaaaaaaaáààaaaaàààa | Brings Lego to life as you're building. It's great being able to turn pieces round to see exactly where they go when the instruction manual is not always clear. | it was really nice | Great helps me in couple hard to build sets but ruins building experience it feels more special building with the instruction book | wow I like this app! | Not bad helped me with 7 sets | the app is perfect for those who want a more accurate representation of the building set | great | cool! | I use it all the time | MUCH more precise the the paper manual. Being able to zoom, pan, and tilt is amazing. I'll never build a technic set without it again. | it has all of the lego packs,bags so youu can even know what you are gonna do. | Great tool to replace the books! sometimes the booklet instructions can be confusing when it comes to placement, but this will make it 3D so you can move the picture around to make sure it goes in the right place! | This app is now essential for every complex LEGO build I work on. The step by step detail are excellent, you can rotate the pieces to ensure you have the right piece and make sure they are slotting into the right place. highly recommended :) | I love doing LEGO'S very therapeutic!! | I like lego builder | Easy and fun build. | brilliant app | love it! | Way too much fun to build!!! Great Lego quality! | Mostly Great. Overall it's extremely handy for keeping track of what you own and organizing your instructions. My only complaint is that not all kits are available. Many of the smaller sets and the bag sets simply don't exist in the app. | You CAN'T DO NOTING YOURSELF. | Very easy to use. My son loves it | so much fun | The best | I love that you can see the step by step build easier then in the book | Grandson enjoyed the build, big wheels loads of fun. | Great app. Just wish more of older manuals were available | So kol | I rated this a 2 because it never gave me an instructions book or anything... It never showed me how to put down the pieces idk if your supposed to put the pieces because...IT NEVER GAVE ME ANYTHING.... To follow or read | love it | it helps me get instructions when I can't find it | Would be good if you could share your list with others, and a wish list function would be handy | love the app helped me so.much and made it much faster to build my lego | Crash randomly while constructing. Sometimes the step is saved but most times you'll need to jump 50ish pages to back. | great option to build with an app. Kind of difficult to backtrack steps, though. | Awesome app! You can search for any Lego set and use a digital building manual. The entire manual is included free of charge in a PDF. | This thing is awesome. I love playing with legos. | Good | Instructions are very clear & allows you to build at your own pace by remaining on screen until you click the button to continue. The 3D aspect is pretty cool & will be helpful on bigger builds. I do have one minor complaint. When I tried to scan the QR code to pull up the instructions for this set, nothing happened. I had to search for the set manually. It showed up right away with no further issues. No big deal, just thought I'd mention this small glitch. Otherwise, I found it very helpful. | very fun and inivative | Stopped to run after the last update on my S20fe. | Absolutely disgraceful and so disappointed | My son is proud that we buy this in month Thanks❤️ | easy to use. love the 3d instruction guide software they developed. love using the catalog to plan my next builds | This is the first time that I have completed. A lego set at 58 years old. I have thoroughly enjoyed completing this and will purchase more. | Phenomenal app. I really enjoyed using it over regular instructions. Especially with the 3D function some sets have. | Used to be able to register a set for VIP points without needing an app. Now when I scan the QR code it takes me straight to the Build app in the download store. No points redeem option. Just download the app. Fine. Tried it, couldn't find anything about registering the set, so useless to me. Don't want/need an app to build and massively object to being effectively forced to download bloatware for something I used to be able to do easily without it. Uninstalled. | Does the job but stomps your battery. Really high power usage for a dressed up pdf viewer | Ffffive stars | rlly good and this always helps me really nice I would definitely recommend this ✌️ thank you | Only want to build not app | Outstanding performance never seen a app like this very helpful to build the blocks and it's so creative awesome performance | is great app 💯 | have all builds on the app. even the ones that cost like $5 in the small plastic bags. that way we can show and know all the one we have done. it'll also the complete total of ALL builds. another thing to help, make it where if we do build off of this app, that it is step by step. not showing 3 or 4 steps at one time. this makes it easy harder to do. doing the Bonsai Tree and having steps like that on the app is very hard to do and read. | Would be great, if I was able to use it. Downloaded this app for my Starry Night Lego build so I could tell the blue shades apart. The app just kept saying ""No Internet."" Kept trying throughout the day, tried EVERYTHING, nothing worked. | What's the point of this? If you have the instructions the app adds nothing. | Love the app it actually works and shows how to do it | Like the app, but have constant issues with the QR code scanner...It takes me forever to register my sets. Makes it more frustrating that there isn't another way to register my sets | easy to use and understand. | First time using this app to build venomised groot. Very good instructions and the fact you can move the pieces about to see exactly were you are putting them is good, which is sometimes difficult with the paper books. Will definitely use again | Search box does not work. It does not bring up the keyboard to type and not taking in typing from bluetooth keyboard. Just renders the app useless.q Edit: re-install did not help. Cant find if there is a list of compatible devices. I have a OnePlus 7T. | very helpful. | This app has helped me build sets way faster | Amazing app!! You can add finished projects to your collection when you're done building within the app. the little animations when you complete a section that goes onto another section are fantastic. Feels like you're winning a small prize every time you get to a new bag. Super clear step by step. Will use the app over the paper book sometimes just for the fun animations and the rotating pieces display. | Been using the ""Build together"" option on the Lego builder app for the Chinese New Year Dragon. it is really fun to do as a family. Only problem i encountered was the massive battery drain means we had to pause to recharge. Was using it with an 8 year old with no difficulty as the app is very clear when to pass each other stuff, and as components built are small it turns a more difficult project easier. Added bonus was it stopped one person from taking over all the building. So more fun for all. | love the ability to turn and move the pieces to make sure they are in the right place! 3D is AWESOME 👍🏾 | referred to this app numerous times assembling the Technic Ford Gt. Very useful app. zoomed in views. precise connection points and the ability to rotate in any position you want to view. Great! | It is useful because I lost book | awesome | missing some of the really old lego sets. but it's a reliable app and handy tool for anyone who lost instructions. for most sets. example set 76000. however there were retired themes like power miners. 4/5 for easy use. id rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. | Perfect for my kids with the 3D instruction | Really nice to use. For building. | The app itself is great, however, I experience frequent crashes when speeding through an instruction book to reach the end. I do love the ease of pulling my phone out to build rather than dig out a book though. | I love Legos | I want a simple way to opt out of ALL but the most necessary cookies. I'm shocked and disappointed that you've chosen not to provide this functionality. I have my first ever Lego set and I was keen to explore the app, but I'm just going to delete it. This will also be my last ever Lego set. | Really good app. Except now the background is all black, it were fine this morning, now its inoperable. I'm using an android. Tried 2 different platforms still the same. | 3d is an awesome affect | Cool Made finding (most) instruction manuals easy You dont have to dig through reddit forums (assuming your set (which is easy to find)) is in the app, throwing away insttuctions is a worry of the past if you l8kentraring apart and later rebuilding sets.

How? Well, we fixed some pesky bugs and improved performance in the app. Now you can build even bigger, better than before!","[""The app has crashed very occasionally, and it consumes your battery like no-one's business, but it's an astonishingly good app overall. There are instructions for older sets, which are just the original instructions cut up. But for newer sets, you can do build parties with friends (not tried myself), and the instructions allow for rotating the image to get a better view, as well as flagging potential mistakes regarding similar pieces (eg wings that have different orientations)."",""Instructions are very clear & allows you to build at your own pace by remaining on screen until you click the button to continue. The 3D aspect is pretty cool & will be helpful on bigger builds. I do have one minor complaint. When I tried to scan the QR code to pull up the instructions for this set, nothing happened. I had to search for the set manually. It showed up right away with no further issues. No big deal, just thought I'd mention this small glitch. Otherwise, I found it very helpful."",""Love the fact that I don't have to keep the paper instructions as well as get instructions for alt models. However, I have had a very bad battery draining, overheating and app crashing issue. Was building one of the alt models for the Galaxy explorer and multiple times during the build I had the app crash (no error message, just app closed and had to reopen, also phone was getting very hot and battery drained very quickly.)

It makes building so much easier, being able to zoom in on the instructions and rotate the model in 3D space to see where exactly the piece is going, not to mention you can now use it to collect your Insider (formerly VIP) points and add them to your account, it's great. My one issue with the app is that it often signs me out for no reason, and I \""need an adult\"" to sign me back in, which I mean, I understand, since the app is predominantly meant for kids.""]",false,false,false,"com.lego.legobuildinginstructions","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.legobuildinginstructions&hl=en&gl=CZ"

The UI is pretty great as well, so for now it's my main browser."",""The browser is the same as others, the difference is that the functions it has in Edge are much more \""helpful\"" than other browsers, it is superior in terms of functions to any browser, but what irritates me is the difficulty of searching for an image, Google is far superior in this regard and any browser in fact, when you search for something and go to images, it's horrible how inferior it is to other browsers is. Disappointing, but I would never stop using just one suggestion to improve!"",""Sadly I am lowering the score of this app. It recently became very slow, and it was quietly draining the battery. Took me days to figure it out. It might be this AI nonsense... Original review on 22/11/2020 (5 stars): Good browser, it syncs well with the Microsoft account, which was what I needed. Even though it's based off the same engine that powers Chrome, MS Edge drains less battery. Navigation is fast, the UI is well-organised and I didn't have any problems since I've started using it."",""Here I go again, installed it again, but now on a new phone with much more internal memory plus the SD card. LOVE IT! Though I still think it uses too much memory storage It also should have tab groups, like Chrome (RIP). As well as the option to download files to the SD card in carpet of our own choice like Opera. Yeah, I really like it, so now I can keep it for good."",""Having 2 accounts (work and personal) is really handy. 3 stars because I like many others have multiple personal accounts, and would like my Xbox account, my personal email and my work email all logged in, but it's limited to only 2, for some reason. The most recent update made it harder to use - accounts don't automatically switch with home screen shortcuts, which is a function the app used to have. Closing all tabs now asks for a confirmation which is inconvenient.

It's very frustrating to navigate when one post has multiple photos but I want to move to next post. 2) sound of other video not present on the Viewing area of the screen starts playing randomly. | Scammer and lying app don't install they are thieves | Developers should keep an eye on r/help and r/bugs. Everything works on web. Otherwise pretty useful. There are few bugs and glitches. | Whatever they did with the last update broke the app so that it just sits on the loading screen. I deleted the app and am only using the web version now. | Swiping to the next photo in a post is literally 50/50. Half of the time it just swipes to the next tab over instead. Can't ""see more"" on individual photo descriptions, when you press see more it just opens the comments. Ads every 3-5 posts. | Look thoughthe app several times a day!!! | All good, still finding my way but great so far.... | way too many adds | The moderators permanently ban you from subreddits with no explanation. | Terrible UI experience | Fun | Great app | Between the bias, the control, and the fake promised freedom of speech of x number of social media platforms available,,, I think Reddit is a better option. | Although reddit is a good app to scroll through forums, it failed to satisfy me. You can post videos and pictures, but then reddit deleted your post. The reason was that I broke the community guideline, which I didn't, and it still continues to delete my posts. If this keeps going on like this, I might have to uninstall and look for a better app just like this, minus the deleting part. | i forced to download this | Works well. Still has some UX issues | The app used to be more or less ok for me. The past week I've been unable to use the app with constant error messages. I can't even login because it keeps saying worng username and password. That's not the case because I can login with the same details through the browser just fine. Anyway, the app has now been uninstalled. | Why still blocking my account???? From 18 days contract Paxful Support Team to solve my issue ( my issue just to verfiy phone number) is not a big issue.. And I'm a network engineer so I know this issue needed 1 hours to solve it... So if Paxful not a scam so why needing all this time?? And why reddit behind behind Paxful??? How much pay to reddit??? I guess reddit behind the customers not behind the company... but I'm stupid to guess it.. Thanks reddit.. | app dont work anymore dont load and cant connect but still get the notifaction form it | Its good app but has problem with sounds sometimes when i scroll on another video there is still sound of the video i already scrolled trough | The official app is a worthless pile of garbage. | I love the many opportunities to laugh and ridicule members in order to hide my own insecurities and ineptitudes | Addictive 😆 lol | 👺 | Its gud, just that if I rated it five stars ot would have a higher rating then rdr2 on the ps store | I love this app! But ever since the recent update I can't post anything! Can't even report it on the app itself | It pushes you to forget the boundaries and think of the real norms and if it's sexy so what it's always been that way or we wouldn't be here.... | It has great posts | I enjoy this app as it is a good place to exchange knowledge and information. | This is one of the best apps ever get great content from gruesome to funny and get great advice from ppl who have real life experience in the question area u are asking it's been a life changer for me love love love it 💯💗 | Previous versions were much better | Good but sometimes hard to load | Can't play videos | You have to manually open other comments besides the first one. | Jesus, so much anti Muslim racism on your site now. Clean it up! | Great | You can barely do anything on the app. My posts constantly get removed because I don't have enough karma or because you have to post a specific way and it's extremely frustrating. Why even have an app if you can't use it? | Please stop trying to update the app to make it more ""cool and futuristic/ cutting edge"" every single time it back fires and a bunch of things that worked just fine go haywire. Just go back like you all did last time, this update sucks. The gestures don't help, and only cut off information that I was once able to see but now literally can not access no matter what I do now. | Hate the update. Hate the overwhelming amount of bots that Reddit does nothing about. Hate the owners of Reddit for selling out and cheapening their once great product. It's no longer the front page of the internet but the CCP propaganda highway ever since they bought out Reddit. 3.24.24 the latest update is beyond frustrating. Can't read ""more"" in a pic without it taking you to the comments instead of expanding the info. Stupid fks as mods and owners. Can't use the back button on you phone now. | Great job | should be called ""Throttledit"". I hope you like getting addicted to different apps because this one throttles you so often you can't use it | Nice | Extremely informative uncensored content. | Revolving door of annoying bugs | They don't enforce the rules set for certain people.You allow disrespectful comments | You can watch ads to get more coins, but it usually doesn't give you the reward, so you watch the ad for nothing. | For some reason the images aren't loading when you click then for preview only the thumbnails are visible. | Used to love this app, but will not let me log in on my new Galaxy S24. Even on the latest update it still says something went wrong. Waiting for a fix. | Very nice every one is nice but as soon as a said ""I'll throw microwaved honey buns at homeless people now) every one's on me like a rabid dog | The one thing I like is you can look up just about any information you may need from people that have experienced what your looking 😉 for! | Love it!! Very helpful in finding answers to most anything and the people are very helpful and courteous!!the groups are so much fun😊 | Most advertisers posting fake ads. | sometimes i can't even open the app, it just keeps loading and loading and loading. my internet connection is not even that bad | I just love this app you have everything you need | The Classic Reddit Still Up🤠❤️‍🔥 | Every year it's somehow worse. | The mods ruin the side, deleting it is the best feature of the app. | Why does reddit recommend me posts related to my location when I've changed it in settings multiple times? This app only gets worse over time | I'm on board | Community driven app with a CEO that cares nothing about the community. Forced to use this awful app lacking so many basic features. The layout for certain sections is awful with no option to change it. Every update seems to make this app worse. Ruined guestues. Stop messing things up. WORST APP DEVELOPERS EVER!!!!!!!!! | Lively discussions and many topics, fabulous. | Unable to connect with current account....same try again warning......unable to create new account because every username is taken....no matter how random a name is created.....anyone have any idea what is going on with this app suddenly. | best ap for nsfw content | Super buggy: app is slow, comments randomly load or page jumps around, images sometimes don't load, swiping through posts doesn't work as expected. Preferred the 3rd party apps before the API pricing changes. | What's the point of a home feed if I can't mindlessly scroll for all eternity? | Reddit is fun was a much better app but they destroyed it. | Stop asking if I want updates every time I leave a subreddit. This app is trash... Bring back Reddit Is Fun | Fantastic | It's cool | My comp™, Guugle keeps me 4 D X "" Fabulous job .nd the person I am to give my reviews although I got paid Once Upon a Time now I pay you, that's funny¡ But when it comes to Reddit, this is a community of wwwz,expert, user, nebbie, Gandalf looking college Profs etc.. 1st EROWEED, who's on D web, from web :) Wikipedia, Google.. Database of all 👆🏻 & 👇via 🔗 & , all served, et voila, @OS,apk,www ALL, now, my review, APK Great, complex issues handled with *#etc, GUI luv it, room4for, allIal l5+ | The app has a lot of bugs. The most annoying is that whenever i get a notification that i got a certain amount of upvotes on a post and i click on it, it doesn't show me the upvotes on the post, until i look it up and open it through another way. | Truely an app of all time | The app closes off suddenly while reading. Its pathetic. | A short while ago, I used to be able to post my pixel art posts in the app. I've been posting some pixel arts for a while back then. But recently just now it says I can't upload my pixel art images because it says my image should be at least by 20 pixels. I don't understand why they have to add this inconvenience. I used to post many pixel art posts and I simply just can't because of this change. Please may you find this post and perform some adjustments to the app so I can enjoy it. Thank you | Cool app | Need to know? Find it here and what others think about whatever it is your heart desires. | I have to use ""Landscape mode for portrait apps"" for this app on my tablet, and even then the font is too small. | Forcing people to use this subpar app (after they rug-pulled 3rd party apps) was the reason I stopped using Reddit after being a consistent daily user for 14 years. Bad UX, performance and visibility of the subreddits I follow... The list goes on. | This app is just bad. It oftens plays multiple videos together. It keeps on playing ads along with normal posts. When I try to comment on a post, in the edit mode, the video keeps auto playing in the background. | Great community, ok app | Can't even log in anymore | I really like this app because it mades you laugh and I can watch it if I wait for someone | This app is not good at all at first when my problem started I thought it was glitch from the app but I later found out that it's the app itself I can't send any messages I can't chat anyone up I can't even follow people I can't give a comment nothing at all and it's really frustrating If it was possible to give a half star damn I will definitely give it | HAAAATE the new gestures. You got rid of the most useful one. | Well, couldn't think it'd get any worse, it actually did. Really the UI was bad now the last update made it worse? Adding extra clicks won't solve the problem. And what's up with the posts whenever I scroll, I'm not able to see anything anymore even after it's refreshing. Useless for me at this point. | Ok | ¿)》□ | I would like it more if it was possible with Reddit for comments to posts to allow previous commentators in threads as such to post fresh comments once notified by Reddit hypothetically of mentioned username in other people's comments just to respond to those comments. | I used a term (ends with a y) that most trans girls I know use to describe themselves and I got banned permanently. Bye reddit. | Awesome | Too many bugs and a really bad overall usability. Deleted my account and deinstalled the app. | Have a family member who has ever had cancer? Well be ready to get cancer ads to remind you about it every 6-10 posts the entire time you are on reddit. Same ad over and over for months now. No way to block it. Fire your user experience team. Never using this app again. | I would stay away from this app. it could be great. however the communities are run by what they call mods. They are not qualified to run for human interaction. Most are disabled individuals. and the mods basically control the narrative. if they dont like what you have to say. they will ban you. and then you will most likey get banned from all of reddit. its the dumbest thing. there is no free speech. stay away. better off with X, or facebook. | Moderation is not good enough you need humans running through it | Very good | I like the app, there are some random actions or lack there of sometimes. Things could definitely be better! Between either the videos not loading until you scroll up a few videos then back down, to the app just not doing anything whatsoever. It's things that, today, just shouldn't happen! Also the horizontal scrolling of videos vs vertical scrolling while browsing is unnecessary. I would much prefer the standard vertical scrolling for both. | It's a pretty laid back site, there's alot of info & ideas on there | I've come to love reddit. For me It's been a great place to see what others think about a particular product or service, and get real feedback from real people. I have also found solutions to many tech issues using reddit | Nice app to dive into personal interests | I love reddit | Interesting | This makes me want to die | Swiping right on albums changes the page. So dang frustrating. | Good | Awful. I used a bunch of third party apps that were great before reddit was sacrificed at the altar of enshittification. Jumped ship to Lemmy, didn't look back. | Anti-user policy of forcing users into app from website | This app is legit my go to for EVERYTHING!!!! | Best place for discussion | I had fun using this app to check videos community and even just plain old fun there is a mix of different kind of content in each video but its fun to use | Informative for subjects that interest me. | Very informative app | So far really good! | Big perverted brother, worse than china | Ever wanted to have the most miserable and neurotic interactions with human beings? You've come to the right place. The land of echo chambers and power tripping mods, no place for a sentient human. Use this only as a source of information. Do not make an account. Do not interact in subreddits. Do not comment. Your mental health will deteriorate faster than you could ever imagine. | Worst app of for disturbing communal harmony. They never ban hate posts but they will ban you if you will reply to them. | Love this app! | I used to like reddit but now that I've switched phones it doesn't like me or my new phone. | Why kill off 3rd party apps - awful | Good | This new update does no good for the app. Nothing else to say about it aside from all the changes were very poor decisions. | 👌🏾 | I like reddit. But I don't like the endless loading on the app. Also annoying af because I have to force open pages on Android if I want to use the sites at all currently. Feedback option just refers me back to.... Reddit which loads endlessly 🙄 | Let's get it. | Annoying. I don't even understand why you need an app. It's a forum! I'd 100% rather just use my browser. If I do though, they have to remind me EVERYTIME that there is an app. Get the app, then they start spamming you with random threads. Please just make this a website. Having a whole app for a message board that already works fine in a browser, is like getting in your car to go from your living room to your kitchen. Why?! It's so you can data mine us. This app in NO way benefits the user. | Fun...but can't wrap head around navigating it to interesting threads | Reddit is an outstanding platform and the accompanying app brings unfettered access to that platform. I would call that a job well done by the app. | Best. App. Ever. Period. | Best leaks of all time fr fr | No third party appa | Nice | Info you cannot get anywhere else. | WHY DON'T ALL COMMENTS LOAD WHEN I OPEN A POST? I MISS RIF SO MUCH | I installed the app and saw there was no way to make the exceedingly tiny font readable within the app, so I uninstalled it after 2 minutes. this app is not usable by anybody with vision problems, and HAS NO ACCESSIBILITY OPTIONS AT ALL! | App sucks more than website | Nice | Not laggy as it used to anymore. | Great app | For several weeks now the app is no longer working. All i'm getting is ""tap to retry"". I have uninstalled and tried to reinstall the app and it's not accepting the credentials yet i can easily connect via browser. I've tried with and without VPN and still nothing. Am i the only one having this issue? | Unlike the other apps reddit shut down, this app doesn't have a ""view all comments"" button, so if you navigate to a comment in a thread, there's no way that I can figure out to navigate to the post. There is no parent button, so you can't even go up a level. Terrible. | Everything is perfect. | The app isn't working and hasn't been for at least a day. That might not be a big deal except Reddit has made it impossible for any other apps to connect to their site without paying a fee. They have also made it impossible to run the mobile version without opening the app unless you uninstall it, because it will open any link through the app, which isn't working. So any time the app is down, like now, the site is inoperable without uninstalling first. Just another way the website is dying. | Slow loading | Terrible app full of trolls and miserable disgusting people everywhere you go or say people will judge you. The world is dying because of stupid people who don't care about others because they think they're big and strong but there not if anyone who sees this review please delete this app now because people will hurt your feelings. People who made reddit should feel ashamed of themselves because of the hate and toxic things people do. This generation terrible I wish humanity was dead | Terrible Terrible Terrible. Can't believe they killed 3rd party apps for this horrible experience. | It's loading for a week now I have tried reinstalling it | Easy to use | It just suddenly stopped working. I was stucking at the loading screen; Re-installed, but I can't even log in now. | Witty and insightful posts. Good and plenty. | Reddit. For years, you don't really need it, until you suddenly do. | Best place for accurate information. | I have just added this app and I'm only starting to learn how to use it! I do enjoy reading the comments. | redit | Who is approving these awful changes? The gestures update was a terrible move. I'm deleting the app. Maybe I'll use the web version instead, but I'm tempted to abandon Reddit entirely. | Works great, pretty seamless UI. Only suggestion I have is to improve notifications. Even after I silence a sub reddit I stumbled upon I still get notifications from it and I don't see any settings for specific sub reddits. Just in general. | Autobanned and no one helped me so now I'm permabanned for no good reason. I won't even be looking at your site anymore: congratulations. | Constantly shows notifications for chats that have already been read or in some cases hidden or deleted/blocked. | I love it but one problem, why can't we delete our inbox messages...? I would love to give 5 stars if that feature is implemented.. | Definitely helpful. A lot of support for people looking for support. To figure out what is unknown. | It needs more improvements like TikTok. | My name is not Mike bresnahan it's James Gretsch so if you could change that | Really happy there's an app for this | Love me some Reddit | It's a great way to get real reviews on just about any product. It end up pulling me in and I read about other topics too. I haven't really got into posting myself though. | U have a Samsung S24 and I was forced to use the browser version of Reddit because I could not get into app, tired resetting data, cleared cache, everything! And I have T-Mobile. The app is garbage, literal. Garbage! I'm not calling T-Mobile when reddit is the one that's having problems. You don't even listen to your costumers! Which is sad. Very very sad. You don't even monitor what's being posted either! This is depressing | Just fix it already, it's unusable. | With the last few updates this app has become nearly useless. It freezes constantly. The UI seems to be different depending on which sub I am in. And it glitches when scrolling through posts. Overall, I am better off reading it in my browser. | Update: new update now makes you click on the post, AND AGAIN ON MORE COMMENTS to read comments Lol POS APP. ""muting"" channel does nothing except reloading to the top of the page. Why release features that don't even work? Half of my posts are ads (not to mention EXTRA LOUD AUTOPLAY) that take up more space than most posts. Terrible experience. | Not Worth. | App not working at all | App is abysmal, inaccessible, and consistently crashes. | This app is great for browsing thousands of communities but it eats a ton of ram, and I'm constantly clearing cache. I'm unable to load more than one photo at a time if at all. I get a ""unable to load photo"" prompt if I'm posting multiple photos. No notifications or suggestions as to which photo or why? I've cropped the photos but nothing works. This app has gone downhill. It's ridiculous and frustrating not to mention sloooow. Did I mention slow? The worst app on my phone | Please allow completely blocking a user = never seeing their posts or comments in subs. | 👍👍👍👍 | Lags like crazy, the scroll ain't smooth | Could u please change where the custom feed is placed. Its annoying | Enjoy variety of content | Still doesn't have half the features/options that nearly every other 3rd party reddit app had. Maybe pay spez more, I'm sure that'll help | Nice community! | Adorable | This gesture update is terrible. | Great app. I ❤️ how the fast app is. Not freezing. I am thankful. | It's vere very cool | I hate this app | Brilliant communities to enjoy fandoms and have thoughtful discussion | Nahh mann | veri nyc app deer 😘 | Good for children. | 2023 dec design is great and is 10x better than new reddit. It made me stop using old reddit and I love it | Amazing | Can't log in no matter what. I get the code sent to me in a text message, I input the code, but it doesn't work. | wow!!!!! | Very nice | So Reddit banned all the good third party apps so they could make more ad money pushing this garbage trash? Unusable, and inserting a sportsbook ad every scroll somehow isn't the worst part. How is it possible to be this bad at mobile? Tapping links rarely works as intended. Goodbye again reddit | Really useful website for advice and sharing 👍 | Most subs are run by jerks. Its pretty annoying. | Keeps crashing and generally sucks | positive and motivating | newest update broke the app 🙃 | 5 stars says it all. | App interface in south Indian languages pls.

We&#39;ve updated our Android app with bug fixes and changes to improve your overall experience.","[""I hate that this is the only viable app for Reddit now. Videos either don't work, or multiple videos start playing at once, or a random video that's not even remotely close to the current content starts playing. Using the Android 'back' gesture for longer than a millisecond and the context menu pops up. Why?! Swiping to the next picture brings you to the 'Watch' page instead. You open the comment section and start minimizing threads? Guess what? They get expanded after 5 seconds again..."",""Reddit has changed the UI (AGAIN) and has made our memorized swipe gestures completely useless. It wasn't bad enough that they moved the context menus from the top to the bottom when looking at media, now no posts are separate when swiping in the expanded view - they're all just connected as if it was one large post. To top it off, now if the next 10 posts haven't pre-loaded if you've got a poor connection, you can't even open a context menu, you're just not allowed to. Now it's useless."",""Clicking the post used to make sense. Now you either open the picture in a separate window, with a \""go to thread\"" button that does not work, and swiping back to home doesn't work anymore. If you do succeed in seeing the text it opens with the ad right above the thread's top reply. Having to scroll up to see the content I wanted to see is annoying. I'm hoping this update is a fix to the problems that Reddit created for itself. This is getting absolutely ridiculous!"",""This \""gestures\"" update is awful. You're supposed to swipe up from the bottom to get to the comments on a post, but if you have gesture navigation on in Android, you swipe up from the bottom to go back. So in the same gesture, Reddit's moving to a new page, and Android's receiving a \""back\"" prompt, which undoes the action of opening the comments, which means if you open a picture in full screen you can't go back unless you tap it and tap the X, instead of using the device's universal \""back\"" action"",""I like the app, there are some random actions or lack there of sometimes. Things could definitely be better! Between either the videos not loading until you scroll up a few videos then back down, to the app just not doing anything whatsoever. It's things that, today, just shouldn't happen! Also the horizontal scrolling of videos vs vertical scrolling while browsing is unnecessary. I would much prefer the standard vertical scrolling for both.""]",false,false,false,"com.reddit.frontpage","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Screw you steam mobile app SCREW you!!!!! | I used my password but it doesn't work I tried using my other of my games that have a password for me to get war thunder | Please update the app icon. It does not adhere to adaptive icon theming or shapes. | Crashes latest android update | It is not nice because I am put my account name and password and it is not working | crashes every time i open it. | Got locked out , the screen just flashed and it wouldn't start | Cannot sign in to the app.. even after i reinstalled it | I've had nothing but issues since the big update that split chat and guard into 2 apps, the huge overhaul keeps breaking every single time i open it when i need it for confirmations or something else. | Sorry for such a bad rating Valve, but it's earned. 1. Changing my phone number in the account and 2. moving mobile authenticator are both done really bad. Not only I have to use 2 smartphones to do it, I also have to use a PC to click on the link on email. Because otherwise, if I click the link on any of the smartphones, it opens in the app and the whole process of changing number/moving authenticator is lost forever. Because that part opens in the browser view. | The app is great, but the bad thing is that i can not access screenshots that i took while playing games on my laptop, those screenshots would only appear on the laptop/desktop version but not on my phone | Doesn't even open. | Worst gaming experience of my life! Ruined my laptop. GTAV wouldn't work and I couldn't get a refund because it'd been trying to run for 2+ hours. | cant loggin | I logged out to change my password & now the app doesn't even start. Stuck on a gray screen. Play Terraria & listen to Aphex Twin. | Ridiculous!!!!! I am not having any Steam account, still it keeps on asking for Sign in Sign in Too bad!!! I will never recommend to download this app. | User experience is very bad and not very user-friendly, worst app - 0 out of 5 | Can't open the app and access my code in offline mode so very inconvineint | Can't sign in | When I try to verify my Gmail it just puts me back to the front page making it an infinite loop (aka I can't make an account) | Best among all gaming stores. | Very faulty. Sometimes it doesn't even open properly. | Keeps crashing | IT WONT PLACE MY USERNAME IS EVELYN PLAYS OK | Store is very buggy, you cant change intent during checkout without it completely breaking the flow, so good luck with any MFA on the same device | A bit slow sometimes, but otherwise works as expected and provides a convenient way to do Steam stuff when I'm not at my computer. | I switched from apple to android and now I can't log in cause it wants me to enter a code on my apple phone but it's gone already. | Freezing the app on splash screen | I am unable to solve security codes Don't download | crash | What a bad app you can't even sign in | App broke after the latest update. | It's hard to creat an account. | Good app but I only recommend buying the games when they're on sales, because the offers are great otherwise the offers aren't that good because I'm not willing to pay ₹1k for some games, But on sales I got 3 Batman trilogy (including a DLC) for less than ₹500 (only ₹202 to be exact) which is better than paying 1000 for all of them. I would also recommend improving the navigation icons and things and also make it easier to find community tabs on mobile. | My I'd hacked I try to recover no help, All my purchased games are gone | Won't let me log in even though I can log into steam on my computer no problem. Garbage app. | 6 stars | Nothing wrong with that, great | Used to work fine. After the recent update it doesn't open on Pixel 7 Pro It just crashes after 5 seconds before loading | Can there be less than an ignorant level of security between me and my games for NO reason?!?!?!? | Just no | Can't access steam guard with offline mode. Steam Guard window not processing in offline mode. It's just gray screen. | Broken. I used the deauthorize all devices and it broke the app to the point where the only thing that worked was uninstall and reinstall. | This sucks I've been trying to sign in for hours and follow all instructions but it keeps sending me backwards and by the time I finally goty account verified it would let me finish setting it up | Steam is a pedo orignaization. They support pedo values | Its crashing | good but would be better if you add the messaging system again | Unreliable app. Often times doesnt load or even open its own link to the app. Or, it just stays on loading screen. | Is this a joke? Already had my account hacked whilst steam guard was enanled, stuff bought and sold and couldn't get a refund, but now they remove the log out function on the mobile app. Steam security at its best. | After last update app crashes for no apparent reason. | Barelly working useless app. Cant comment or write post on community board and so. Totally abandonned by developer app - uses 3 years old chromium 85 browser which blocks logging to PayPal when trying to purchase anything (you can aswell easily lose your money due to it, as chromium 85 is most insecure, thus not used by any service provider for a long time, except Valve) ... In few words - pathetic incompetence and spitting in customers faces... | Worst new account sing up process... Not set new password very very poor setup sorry guise | Crashes constantly on startup | Just glad that it wants me to use two facotr authentication but it won't let me stay signed in on my phone to use the authenticator. Glad i get to deal with this bull cause I am stuck on your app in a position that it won't fix itself and all I can do is uninstall and reinstall and hope to god it works. Thanks for that | I love steam | Broken app. Trading buggy and not possible. Broken app. | Love the app it's awesome when Im at WORKIE | App wont open and keeps crashing | I purchased GTA 5 a week ago and I forgot my steam password since 7 hrs I'm trying to login even submitted everything and I got the same mail and number as well but still no response from them at all. | bro the steam app is useless it does not let me move my authenticator to other devices.When ever I try to move my authenticator to other device it says there was a problem signing in.Im tired of this even does not let me sign on my laptop says the same problem .And now I an still getting the same problem please fix this. | Won't even start | Imaging playing a game for five minutes, looking for a refund under steams policy, but after a week, still no refund | When I was doing login the password and email are wrong. Then I check they correct but it's show's wrong. I hate this app. See developer you had readed or hadn't. I'm warning you update this app | Waste of time. Prices so high. Poor user experience because everything requires paying. So many useless features. | Whenever I try to open the app and designing it doesn't let me sign | Keeps crashing | Ga bisa log in 🥲 | I don't have an account yet it wants me to sign in | Trash. This is pure garbage. It is clunky and when you text codes to log it the codes don't work. If I didn't have to use steam I wouldn't. | Normally works great. But with the new update can't open the app at all. Can't use the steam auth or anything | Impossible to pay using PayPal, the screen is in an infinite loop asking for PayPal username | IT KEEP CLOSING | Every time I check out to buy a discounted game, the app always rejects my payment method. | Keeps crashing | Can someone help me? I've already tried everything on repeat just to create an account but it kept on opening Chrome and asking to verify through my Gmail; done this over a dozen times. I just kept on receiving verification email (quoted emails after the very first ones, meaning it's the same sht over and over again). How will I ever create an account? Same shtty problem through my pc, captcha kept failing. It's excruciating. | Bro. Let me log in. Changed my password 4 times and keeps telling me incorrect password. | It won't let me sign in | Horrible never works properly. I can't even open it 99% of the time, and yes, I have a good phone s23 ultra, so I know it's not my phone. Also I could never get steam guard to work when I clicked it and it always made me re login to do anything and it would get stuck in loops doing so. | latest update made app crashes everytime i open it, W-T-F | I can't even access the steam guard code in offline so what's the point of using this feature. Especially my wifi is really slow and restarting my phone or clearing the cache doesn't fix the problem. | We need free gift codes !!! | It is a best app i seen ever | Fun m cool | Doesn't even open after the most recent update (2024-03-18) | Crashes every time I tried to open it. | Can't log into account on any device, tried making a new account and steam says account doesn't exist. | I want to give 0. I can't find way to get in game I buy or install. Even my cousin Lincon couldn't find way. | When i need to log in on pc it always need this app and its annoying because i dont use this at all and i unistall it, now i need to install this useless app just to log in on my pc | This company is a monopoly you can't buy your PC games really anywhere else but from here after you pay for them eventually steam will tell you you no longer have access or your license to your games and none of your library will open up or update there's really no fix and there's no way to get ahold of anybody that works for this company to try to fix it | ta walona aplikacja nie ma funkcji blika a na dodatek zabiera pieniądze | Buggy mess | At startup app shows steam logo then freezes and crash the app. App is just getting worse | Crashes too often | won't use my default browser, trys to use Samsung browser which I will not setup | TERIBLE app | Can't even login with a QR code. Please fix ASAP. | Nice app😃 | Not a huge fan of the update to be honest. I mostly used the app to chat with friends, and as an authenticator for my account. So it's kind of annoying that I need to have two apps for that now. The new app also doesn't seem to run the best on my phone. I don't really love the new layout either. I'm sure I'll get used to it, but I had no problems with the old layout. The app is still useful but just annoying that for my usages this update was almost entirely a downgrade. | Great, still need a little bit more improvement especially the cart ui. | Trash af | Good Very potty | This is the worst app ever IT HAVE PASSWORD TO UNLOCK I HAVE ACCOUNT ON IT WHY YOU ADDED PASSWORD BUT NOT IN SIG IN | How am I supposed to buy games if I can't see cart icon this app is full of bugs and glitches | Worse app in the world 🤬🤬 | Cant even make a account piece of garbage | App is crashing when try to use stem guard camera. | PayPal doesn't work | who's create those ugly ui 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 also the capta are so outdated and always not working | STEAM NEEDS TO FIX THIS LAGGY OR BUG BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE EVEN A ACCOUNT IN STEAM AND I TRIED TO CLICK THE ""don't have a steam account? "" IT WON'T WORK AND I TRIED THE USER AND PASS IT KEEP REPEATING IT SELF AND GO STRAIGHT IN SIGN IN!!! | Yasoooo | Trainz Simulator | random updates cause the app to cease to function. | Takes days to get support to do anything other then send pre written emails. Ok I have an issue that is not in any of the support. I can not get anyone to respond to my request for assistance. The solution I say again is not in FAQ, or any of your other documentation. I am done with steam. | Can't even open the app, it crashes. | It seems as if nothing works anymore. I spent some time trying to gain help with logging into my account in vain. I tried to find anything other than FAQ to help but the ""captcha"" doesn't work when trying to recover username/password. I'm just trying to play a game or two for God's sakes. Developers are the new money/blood suckers vs lawyers. Ridiculous | It's like Real player from the 90s. Trash trash trash | Too many bugs | Thanks for locking me out of my account | Can't complete purchases | Steam will delete your purchases and then say they cannot restore them. | Horrible app. Even can't create an account! Sucks | Stupid app can't even type in verification code | The application is very nice and informative. The application is very fast working in the phone. I have used the application. It's giving survics nicely. The application is progressing day by day | Very Nice Apps😊 | You never get the game that you searched for, truly disappointing. | I got my account has been, won't be work, can't login, star 1 now you can star down My waste of time, im studying for day per | useless app...entering username and password is no problem, but entering the guard code is impossible...charcaters change location when entering them. | steam good good8 | It would be good if we can see and adjust categories in the game library. | Steam guard won't let me type in the code sent to my email | Is the login to its own authentication for login. Fails login with no specific error then says too many attempts as if I did something wrong. | Capthcha doesn't work and account recovery is near impossible. | It's pretty much only good for looking at games, and even then, it seems to have issues loading pages. Furthermore, navigation is quite confusing. | Many games to choose from | I try to log in and entering the guard code is BEYOND BUGGY! It jumbles everything i type in and the ability to backspace does not exist here. | it would not allow me to create an account due to the ""im not a robot quiz"" | Buggy, couldn't even make it past the login code verification screen | can't believe this is an App of a gaming platform. so terrible | It's hard to log back in to my account and it's also hard to make a steam account | 100 notifications an hour about nothing the app. | I can't buy any game there is no option for Google pay 😭 | Has anyone from stream tried to put a verification code in as it just don't work. | Terrible. I download this and open it, i dont have a steam account so i made me create on on my browser. i did it and went to a free game and it asks if i have steam installed but on computer browser. i pressed yes and the screen didnt do anything. so i then pressed no bcause i dont have the browser one on my chromebook. it sent me to download it and said it wasnt compatible with chrome. Face it, ask ur parents to get u a moniter/computer/pc. because chromes are wack when it comes to gaming. bye | The Steam app is essentially all of the social features of the desktop client, without the ability to play the games. It also is a must have for security as it allows you to enable 2FA to keep your game library safe, and it actually makes logging into your account easier in the process. This app is a must have for any Steam user due to Steam Guard but if you're a big fan of Steam like I am, grabbing all three of the apps helps to further enhance what is already an amazing experience. | Payment fails most of the time and whenever it succeeds it says error then they send me the game after few hours. Frustrating | Besttttt | Should probably introduce a feature to be able to download soundtrack and other media directly to mobile for ease of use | I like 👍 | It's great | I don't under stand this app my email is real buts it's say my account is incorrect | Never got it to work. | I don't understand what other people is talking about, it's not confusing at all if you actually try to understand how it works. It's easy to understand,navigate and great for finding games while you're not at your computer/laptop. Please ignore the other people's stupidity and ignorance. I can pay,add to cart,add money to steam wallet and buy dlc just fine. It also doesn't have network issues. | Steam Mobile app works like a charm... Steam Guard is an added advantage. | Steam should filter game reviews or simply remove ones that are in no way related to the game, so tired of looking for real reviews to only to be met with unfunny idiots making nothing reviews because they have no life. Worst part is those nothing reviews are often highly rated and awarded, never knew the PC community was filled with such sad, boring losers. | Good | Body shamers 😂 They keep on removing and banning games that has asian body types, which is really offensive for us Asians | Put my user name and password in and it keeps saying thats not correct. But its correct on pc when i put it in. Change the password and still doesn't work. | Cannot put code from email to verify. It just doesn't work. So it's useless... | Pretty nice app. Could use some minor improvements. And it should be easier to chat with friends, Steam chat app should be built in. Steam is the best game launcher for PC imo. | I tried to get signed up and I could not read it at all. Not useable do not download if you have a low resolution type of phone. DISAPOINTMEN! | It's poor I signed up my account because I don't have a account yet, It keeps saying it's verified. | Terrible UI. Can not enter more than 1 number in guard code field while the code requires 2 numbers to be entered. | Went to remove authenticator. Instructions said through the app. Gives me outdated screenshots. Basically impossible to remove via the app. | i love u steam | Why is it so hard to sign back in | My account got hacked while being away from my desktop, i immediately got an email that my password and email (russian federation) got changed. I contacted support and rushed home, when i opened my email i got a message from support that my account has been saved. All that within 15 minutes!

I have had to close the app twice already and I still cannot sign in the normal method. | Good app thankyou stram community | Очень полезное приложение. Когда уехал в другой город и ты далеко от компа то все равно можешь покупать игры и следить за скидками. Но порой лагучее | I cant log in due to the verification code input it keeps over typing in the wrong blank | Plz add Google account system to log in | Steam is king. I have all my games and friends in one place. Also I love the steam guard feature. And just do away with my passwords. Thanks Valve. | My experience so far has been ok after using the app very lightly over the last few months. Only 3 stars. You'd think that a company like valve would have a killer app that is highly rated and works for everyone but apparently not. | do not force links to open in Chrome. let them open in the default browser. stop autoplaying videos. | Brown and love Jesus | Usually I have a fine experience with Steam, however i have encountered an issue where the page where you are meant to be able to reschedule your gift is unexpectedly blank, preventing a reschedule. Additionally, it is incredibly hard to find a way to report this issue or ask for help. I've tried to send an email but I have been left with no response. | Months ago I lost access to my account, every time I reset my password the message ""check your password and name"" shows. When I try to get help with my account, I am required to access the account first (wich is the problem). No email to reach a real person at all. At the end of the day, I paid for some software I am not allowed to access, and no way to get some help. I have tried all the options on the support page, but nothing works, just wasted my money. Never again Steam for me or my kids. | Whenever I'm entering my steam guard code it just scrambles what I'm typing and I can't even change it because my keyboard doesn't backspace it so I can't even log in. | App is okay and great for quick purchases. Not much use passed that. I would love for Steam to expand it's app and add a soundtrack player to the app. This way while your at work you can listen to the soundtracks you purchased. | i want to make an account cuz i dont have one. then i need to log in in an account to make one but i dont have one!? so how tf are you supposed to log in? (edit) i found out u could only make an account with an pc. so why does is say you can make an account and not just say that it only works on pc? | Good | Dojodp😇 | worst signup process, mf invalid captch to create mf account 🤬, which mf robot will be signup your freaking website or app, play store please remove this application 🤬 | What does Valve even do except sit on their platform and ambiently make money from other people's transactions? Because they sure as hell don't reinvest it into their apps, which are buggy, barely updated messes. | Can't even type in the stream log in vertification code. I try to type it in but it keeps skipping the letters, must be a glitch. | When I make a account it doesn't work | ไวทุกอย่างยกเว้นเรื่องคืนเงินช้าโคตร | App sucks can't even log in they send a code to use but App won't let you type in correct so App is useless | The steam app still has many bugs that has never being fixed. | Can't even use the app because I can't get pass the steam guard. Recently got a new phone Galaxy S24 and am trying to log into my account. Once I get to the steam guard page it emails the code to me then when I try to type it in it mixes the letters and numbers and doesn't allow me to fix it. Can't even delete what I typed. Physically unable to use the app because of this. | Geometry dash | Unresponsive | How is this app so bad? Literally the only thing I use it for is to check to see if my friends are online, because this app is just really awful at doing the things it's built to do. It's truly strange. | Unable to log onto account. Steam guard code gets emailed however the app won't allow me to enter the code. Keyboard does not open up and allow you to type. It's useless at this point in time. Also, every time I request a code, the code sent to my email is always the same. Not sure if that's intended or not. | I never liked steam sure I accidentally keep messing up my own making account but I can't do it again it won't let me!!!! | App suddenly stopped loading my library. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling and logging in and out, but nothing worked. It was working just fine earlier.. | Can't make an account because I'm not a robot is broken Please Fix | It won't let me create an account, if i verify my email it brings me back to sign in page | five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Can't get passed the security code part because none of the letter/number inputs work at all.","{""1"":401373,""2"":89138,""3"":58317,""4"":79972,""5"":372768}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Valve Corporation","Valve+Corporation","steamandroidapp@valvesoftware.com","http://store.steampowered.com/about/mobile","Valve Corporation

No Dababy. | Twitch is a great app and platform. I recently subscribed for the first time, as a Tier 1 Subscriber to Ironmouse's Twitch. Really loving it!!!!! 5 stars out of 5!!!!! 10 out of 10!!!!! Love this app!!!!! | Best app made for the best streaming contents. | Its great | Great if YouTube isn't long enough | มีตำรวจรึยังทหารหละศาลหละมีรึยัง มันมีรึยัง ดูเว็บคนเย็ดสัตย์ กูใช้กฎหมายใช้ศาลมาจับทั้งหมด มีรึเปล่า แล้วมึงจะสูญพันธุ์ | I can't use the app, When I launch the app, it shows a white screen and nothing happens. My phone: Xiaomi Redmi note 12 4G Android Version: 14 | I love it. | W app | glitches during livestream | Just ban the hot tubs | Great app to watch my fav streamers | What is there to say? Twitch on mobile app? It's the best! | I'm a kid 🤬 | Sometimes just stops working | Loving it | I love the app bc there are thousands of channels and streams all the time. | Love it | I love watching people play games. | it's not working at all -_- | Simply refuses to connect to chat!! | I love the app, its a fun way of communicating with the content creator and also a entertaining app to watch. | Great content and it's really easy to start a channel yourself | No benefit for my life, amazon is company to boycott | I need help it wont let me log into my account like, I would receive the new device / location verification code but when I press submit that little circle spinny thing pops up and after a bit it disappears and I'm stuck on that screen so please devs any advice would be helpful | Nice | This app is awesome! It's the best gaming app where you can interact with streamers in real time. The very first time I watched a chess game,Hannah Sayce was saying hello and answering chess questions that I asked. 10/10 Must have! | not working keeps reloading.. | hilarious | To many ads | I love the way we can interact with the people that steams on the app so that's a plus and that anyone can steam on in that's nice | What can I say?.. it's a good app I really recommend the sighing in was kinda annoying it took a day to get a verification code but worth it🌟💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾 | Love it. No other comments | 30 second preroll ads = immediately leave the stream. You're doing yourselves and creators out of revenue. Creator mode on mobile is under-featured. You can edit your clips but can't change a video title. Hypocritical emoji acceptance process. You can watch a woman in a bikini lick a microphone but you can't upload an emoji with a 💩 or a tongue in it. There is a global gasm emoji but you can't upload an emoji with ""gasm"" content 👎 | Just a glitchy mess on mobile. Bout like a cod lobby. | well done | It's fun to see other twitch streamer play games that you can't 🫡😐 | IT WONT LET ME LOG IN | Pretty good I'd say! I like to go live, and gain new friends and followers, if anyone sees this, watchy Terraria and Minecraft streams, they will be about 30mins-1hour, I'm not very good yet, but thanks for This amazing app!! | I was great 👌👌🥂👌 | Idk like it ig | I watch caseoh, great reception time | I love thus app | I love streaming lol | It's ok | Good I like it | Great application for open minds. | Very good | New chat popout is very annoying, please just add the option to just disable chat on mobile, as someone who never uses chat it's just so sad that they have the option for chat only, audio only, but no video only. It's way too easy to activate the chat overlay accidentally and have to cycle through it to hide it again. | It's really a nice specialised streaming platforms but it's need high source of internet connectivity and GPU and many more for smoothly streaming over computer as this app is for mobile you can't be accessed more features of it but for watching stream it's better morethan YouTube , I want to add some features on this app that during watching stream audience can directly chat with video and voice like discord, WhatsApp then it will be more fun entertain very peoplev firstly prefer this platform | I will rarely use this because of the triple stack ads about random house hold appliances but they only stream on this so I get to miss half of his stream just watching trash | Honestly, I used to use the website and I recently switched to using the app. To me it's a great and stable app to use(my opinion as a rookie). I didn't face much problems using this app on my phone. You should consider switching to the app from the website on your phones. And if you haven't used twitch yet it's a good live stream app to use. You should definitely check it out! | It's a w | Have to give this a try it 😎 cool | When I serach genre's I got a different game | Is a cool app | new update very slow. The old style is better. | Love it. Best streaming platform ever | it's so fun I can chat all day .🤭 | there is always massive Delay | Why can't I get all the notifications for when the streamer I want to watch is live? I've been missing my favorite streamer's streamer for weeks just because twitch won't send me the notifications. | Why twitch some stream showing black screen with sound | Nice way to communicate with people, but buggy sometimes. | Everything I need is in here | Difficult to navigate. Constant errors that require restarting TV. | Good app | I tried logging into my account but it says that I couldn't log in because my E-mail was apparently ""Invalid"". This sucks! | Imagine have a chat for streams, but the streamer can't see the messages. JOKE!! | Trying to make this a paying job | Why I can't verify my phone number ??!! | Much much worse than watching from pc. 95% of the time can't use channel redeems or tjeu dont refresh the same way as browser viewing. Watch streaks don't accumulate/show correctly | Hateful platform from any pov! Moderation is audacious in any channel. Updates break the prior version. Censoring urself in chat will be taken as offense, to give an example. ""you can't mean that stuff. I will not explain, or expose myself in any way but excommunicate you infinitely"" that's literally called fascism, where I'm from. I am also still missing an ignore function for channels. Unban appeals being optional is the platforms responsibility. I will shoot twitch representatives at sight. | Twitch is losing big streamers to Kick. To make up for this, they increased the number and length of adds. Now you have to watch up to 8 adds each up to 1 minute long. And this every half hour. refresh live stream? More ads. They also increase add Volume to 500% on purpose. They ignore everyone complainig about unnormalised add volume. This is forbidden in the Netherlands but they ignore it. Somehow we all have to obide by Twitch TOS, but they can break multiple laws in multiple countries. | Can stream everyday and overall love the community | i noticed that if you have too many people that you follow and are live. You basically can't see the people who are all the way at the bottom. At some point it stops going down the list because twitch just won't let you on the web browser. | Love twitch | Nice! But Having Some Problems With Me I Forgot My Username! It cant be recovered! 😔😭 | stream manager is absolutely broken | Soo fun ads bit to long other than that great | Liked it when it used to do 1 or 2 ads but now 8 to 10 1 min long ads crazy | Love this app! Super convenient to have stream manager on my phone when I'm streaming. Would love to see more twitch studio features added to the app, or maybe a completely separate twitch studio app. Just a thought. | Video quality is potato level. Streams pause every couple of minutes. Ads blast loud enough to make your ears bleed. | Twitch I like your app it's really good | Love it | Cannot stream to Chromecast after the latest update (stream icon is no longer there). Edit: had to restart my router, and now it connects. Why??? | It's easy to use so ya fr fr | It's it's. Boring | dogwater. 1min ads r a joke.cant skip the bs. soo many adds on TV app too. so I just use YT | Rating this a five just because of niyeko | So many b00bs for my young V Virgin eyes | At least once or twice a day twitch crashes and says no response and I have to reboot I have your latest update and my tablet is good there's nothing wrong with it why do you keep crashing | Twitch fosters community, offers live entertainment, supports creators, enables interaction, provides diverse content, encourages learning, hosts esports, offers monetization, and promotes real-time engagement.love it ❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍🤝🤝 | Awesome app | Its a good app | 💯🪄🧸📸✨️✨️✨️✨️🎬⌨️🖱🎮🕹♥️ | Great love the service | Great for playing and watching streams without using resources on your gaming platform. | Twitch wont allow me to have an account i tried signing up 6 times but still it says ""your not aligibal enough to have an twitch account but thanks for checking us out"" i want an account thats all i want. so it is getting annoying i want a account so badly why twitch why | Good to stream with better then kick | Great experience great live just love it | Really great for managing streams, especially with higher end streaming devices. | Best app in my opinion. | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Dont usually review extensively, but this time the app reaches expectations, it has much more interactive meterials then youtube and the people are generaly nice, 5 stars | Better than youtube | Tried uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing cache - never loads quickly, even on WiFi and constantly throws up 'Network Error' messages. I just want to watch a PAX East stream, but can't... | Softcore adult content. | It's great and runs smoothly.👍😊😁 | Nice streaming app bus sometimes there are bugs | Best app on phone | Miserable. The browser version on phone wouldn't even have the feature to adjust the quality which is horrible. It automaticly tries to push the quality into higher number which make some delay and loading in between the streams indicating that they're either lazy and don't care about boosting the viewers expierence or just trying to make people download the app and either way its just sad too see them try to gain fame by leaving not much of an option to the users. | Luumuno's Luumuno's think you will have more of the world to continue to continue to continue with children m the following information to continue to use to the office for me and to provide provide them with my current contract as | Buena calidad | Really fun | Love twitch | Ok if we talking trash talk | Pretty good | Good app | They probably could be sued for theft. If you subscribe to a channel, they don't grant access upon payment. From the website to the app, nothing consistently works, including logging in, staying logged in, finding a channel, or subscribing to a channel. Let's not forget how video playback skips, stops, and forgets its place, then is unfindable again. I have subscribed to one channel and consistently can't get to the content without a random video playing from a random start point. | Fun way to learn more about games I love | New looking forward to using this app.. | Twich sometimes just uninstalls itself and there is like 8 30 sec ads after watching for 3 mins and i founs this 10 year old and i could not report him👎 | Lags, buffers, doesn't load. Your mobile app is garbage like your company. | Porn site fr | Meh if it has the yt shorts like vertical layout then it would be way cooler, the horizontal layout when vertical is kinda boring looking | Please let us disable Stories. I don't need nor want them. Also story notifications must be turned off PER channel. Awful. | Fast and steady app with lots of options to view different genre's and streamers highly recommended | Great work 🫡👍 My name is Grimmjow... I'd like to share a couple of tips and tricks. Let's make some 💰 money together. Again , great work 🫡👍💯 | Frequently fails to connect to chat for whatever reasons | Easy interface, love their Xbox features | Love it 😊 | Nice | Awsome | Great community | It's great just missing irl stream that does not work otherwise I would have given 5 stars | Can't use it at work. But any other time! Its awesome. | It's a good app to use | Greatest app for streaming all time .

I can't get the new YouTube app on my tablet but I can't get Twitch!!! The povrished thank you. | Fun | Ads are annoying | Love it good app :) | For some reason chat glitched during a livestream and therefore I couldn't comment and had to refresh to see newer comments and it just wouldn't work properly and I have been having a few other glitches too. | Too much ads no really too much | Wish I could access more with the app like the prime gaming stuff. Other than that it's easy and smooth | I like streaming on this app Just it's hard to get followers and viewers | this app is crazy it doesn't work it's broken so don't donwload you will just waste your time and your money | They told me too so yeah, I did exactly that. | Incredible | Great if you can afford a bunch of subs otherwise its add ridden drivel | Cool | I'm only downloading twitch do I can watch canman18 | Great app just to many adds some times | I love how it can hook up to my PC | Hope u like getting banned easily and watching alot of ads | Perfect app for streams of all types. | I stream on here and it's my only personal preference one of the best platforms | I cannot send chat ,and it doesn't show at all | Is the best | Overall I have had a good experience with twitch, but as of recently I found it difficult to search for one of my friends that does stream on twitch, if I try typing the name nothing, but I can see it on her end. I don't know what's going on with that | 🤟 | I can't log in | Newest update is very unstable. Constantly disconnected from chat with no way to reconnect. | Idk it's da best | Nice | Unreliable Server side. | Can't log in 😡😡 | VODs stopped playing at all | Constant stuttering and buffering to the point it is unusable | The live stream option comes up but then it stops before you know it disappears what kind of dodgy app is this I've been trying to stream on mobile for a long time and it don't ever work😡 | Too many ads. It almost becomes hard to watch twitch because streamers would force viewers to watch pre-rolls to mid-rolls then take ad breaks, and then once they stream again, the same thing. I can't watch twitch for 10 minutes without seeing a bunch of ads. | It's Twitch lol | It helps he unwind | Hacía mucho que no usaba la App, he entrado y jamás había experimentado una App tan hostil, me he sentido agobiado por lo mal optimizada que está, imposible encontrar cosas básicas. No suelo poner comentarios en las Apps, pero esta se lo merece. | quality | Support sucks for me zero help need human support not some automatic bot | Sorry | I just like to watch caseoh | Good | It has a tons of ads this app has 6 ads for every 5 mins not prefer | Great app but. Super buggy after update. Have a Samsung note 20. Can't close app sometimes, can't interact with chat sometimes.

"Google Family Link","Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.


  With Family Link, you can:

  Establish Digital Ground Rules
  • Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.
  • Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.

  Manage and secure your child’s account
  • Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device.
  • Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.

  Stay connected on the go
  • See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.
  • Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.


  Important Information

  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
  • While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.
  • Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.","Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online.

Just keep in mind it won't help you with complicated math, like If you are doing a physics course and studying quantum mechanics, you must already know math anyways, but if you are stuck on a problem, this app isn't going to help you. You will have better luck with Google."",""I've been using Photomath for about 2 years now. I started using it because of the textbook feature. It was great at giving answers and explaining the problems. But recently, the app has been bugging out, and it keeps giving me \""We are unable to loan data. Please check your internet connection and try again.\"" Even though I know I have good Wi-Fi. I don't know why it's doing this, but it's getting really annoying. Please fix whatever is wrong.""]",false,false,false,"com.microblink.photomath","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microblink.photomath&hl=en&gl=CZ"
