It won't load pass 84%. Do I have to delete and restart? | I am absolutely hooked on this game and I get Fetch reward points Win Win | üëçüèº | Very relaxing game..graphics are good too | Nyc game | So fun! There are many different merge options and it's fun without being incredibly hard üíú | Interestimg game | Fun | Fab | Amazing | Addictive | I never thought I would like a game like this.. I'm hooked and I can't stop playing I am having so much fun!! | TERRIBLE ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è I couldn't figure it out, AT ALL üò† | Great game | I hate it | I'm having a lot of fun playing this. With two pairs of readers on its clearer.What I really like it's fast paced but not timed and it waits for you to find moves on your own before flashing suggestions. Thanks | I enjoy it. | Would love to be able to play, but right now it either only loads so far or gets to 99% and tells me to contact developers. Tried every form of troubleshooting, still no dice. | Love | I had to uninstall after I spent money on a diamond bundle. Lost over half my diamonds. | You learn to like/love the game, but it's designed to where players need to spend money. Like others mentioned, if you don't, you have to wait hours to get more energy to play the game, as it's used fast. You can only watch maybe 3 to 4 ads per day to get extra energy moves. I dislike all the waiting and will look for another game that's similar. | It hangs am at level 45 nd it just hangs. Please do better an update will do good | It was fun, although not a big game player | It's really fun to play | Wanted to play this game but it just won't let me all it does is freezes up and takes for ever to get out of it. Really liked what I did get to play but I have to uninstall it. | In the beginning, seems a good drag-and-merge games... after that it' just boring and monotonaus games. Power recharge so slow, daily quest is so hard, and again, monitonous tasks. | Love this game.. | NBZEZR , s,a,mi melsmories mdsssg | Advertisement was totally different than the game. | I miss playing it but whenever it's on wifi it won't work anymore as of a week ago. I'm not interested in this until it's fixed. Did everything suggested from the online help to fix my app, nothing works asides from swapping to data. Great... | I enjoy this game A LOT. It is simple and creative. Why did I lower rating? Because it is a match game and there is no room on their board to match. They keep adding things, which are great fun but they don't add tabs or room to the main board and storage area as you move up. I am level 58 and have no room, keep having to delete thungs i need. They also don't let you complete a collection before putting it away and moving on. Give us more room!!! Your ads have more room. | Bad | It takes forever to win a level. | üòÅ | Nice | Takes really long to accomplish a few tasks some task are impossible to get accomplished, is especially seeing that there are very little help given towards the accomplish. And some task to me are just incompetent. | I am very much happy with this game. | Play this game only if you want to spend loads of your hard earned money. The daily challenge is impossible to complete without buying diamond and energy. Amount of each spend is also high making person think a lot before buying. I am thinking of uninstalling the game | Can u just do better rather than making people spend too much money to buy gems. Every slightest thing is buying.. Domt be too greedy, the game is fun and addictive nd i guess dat what you want but ne pitiful. Dont let people spend too much and stop been greedy | Nothing special about this game that deserves to be paid. Can't play for more than a few minutes without needing to purchase upgrades. Garbage!!! | Fun game,bright,alot to solve, and all the different things that merge together I play every day the lives fill up quickly, very good game, | I can not open my game now. | Relaxing üòå | did not show rules | Great game | I really like the game itself, but DO NOT let your children play it! You can choose to watch ads to get extra lives or pop bubbles but they can be HIGHLY inappropriate bordering on porn! | Best 2024 game in the world I love it so much if it gets deleted I will literally cry üò¢ üò≠ that's the best game ever | Fun | Fun | I'm not getting items I paid for and it's not even timing right. I say here and played for over an hour and received one minute of credit | I don't know how to play | Fun merging game that has a lot of game play before you need to re-up energy. | Great at first, but now they changed their game. They used to have a side game where you would try and get to level 15 in 4 days. They haven't done it for so long. I'm level 50, its getting to be the same old thing and not fun anymore | Fun with a cute story | The first level gave me nothing to merge and I wasn't able to even play the game. | Let's make some money üí∞ | Great time clear,watching videos for energy only seems to work now and then though | Fun game | very nice game | Fun game | While the game is fun, the pricing is very high and disappointing. 100 coins is extremely limiting and costs are very expensive. Spoils the fun. The game uses up 40 diamonds for every 100 coins repeatedly when u have lots of diamonds. It's unfair as it does not do 10 diamonds, 20 and so on. This makes poor use of our purchases! | Awesome | Really helps with my anxiety,big thanks x | It has been taking years now for it to update after updating it's saying the game is not available in my country, it's just so annoying after playing for so long to get to the level I am now üòû | I started playing this because of the fetch app. It is entertaining enough to play for points but I would be bored by now without the rewards | Newest update: hate the art updates. The orders to fill with it originally already took too long, and now they take even longer. It takes at least a week just to fill an art order for anything other than the pictures. The board fills too fast and it's not even enjoyable anymore. | no ads!!!! | I love that game q | I have been playing for hours | I just downloaded your game and there's no instructions and NOTHING to merge! Not a good look... | üëç | Really like it | Very fun | fun | Fun | Not interesting | This game make sure you have plenty of extras that you can do absolutely nothing with because you're only allowed to trade twice. And what happens to the extras do they turn into lightning bolts for extra energy? If not, they are useless! | Great game to kill time. | Very relaxing I love this game | Boycott moonactive games | Great | Doesn't work with Mistplay. | I enjoyed it. What I really like most is engaging with other users while trying to complete a task given. | This game got to be boring, | fab | Haven't worked in two days and now telling me I have to update it updated it and it still not letting me play ugh and the sad thing is I liked this game | I love this game, but recently it doesn't load. It says a problem has occurred contact support. I tried everything and even wrote a mail. But it still won't work. | Graphics are great, in the beginning it feels like a five star game until level 11-12, than you can't move forward, and it takes alot of energy to move up. | Simple, easy, time killer and good way to earn Satoshi on the Ember app. | Love this game | I love the game I just wish that it gave more lightning bolts in less time so I can play longer without having to pay real money | Best | Very nice | I started to play this game 2 weeks ago and I was really enjoying it unfortunately after the last 2 updates the game is unresponsive seems like frozen, can't merge the objects, can't invite friends, can't close it, my touch screen is OK but the game doesn't work, no stars for now. | Fun | Please update the charging speed of energy 30-45 seconds instead of 2 mintsü•∫, it is taking too much time. | Barely 5mins in and already asking to make a purchase. Run out of energy quickly so you can only get so far. | Really fun game lots to do. It's a lot of fun. | I like this game for the most part. I wish there were more opportunities to trade cards. I don't see why that wouldn't be closer to 10 cards a day as opposed to 2. Even pokemon go you can send 25 gifts a day. | It was fun but you have to spend alot of $$$$. Takes 2 minutes to get 1 energy. That's too long. I don't think I'll play this anymore because I wasted too much time | Satisfyingly fun game with design pleasing to the eye and audio pleasant to the ears. It gets more strategic the more you play it. | Won't load past 35%. Fully updated, just downloaded it yesterday. Sad | It's weird at moment but then you get what they ask for ... if your looking for something just get your mind off of things.. it's perfect for that!!! | So addictive. But please, create another way of earning those diamonds. We mustn't pay for it. | Fun | Good game | Terrible update! The new graphics design is awful, the chains are even longer than they used to be and feel almost impossible to collect. Forget the daily challenge - no chance! Why fix something that wasn't broken? Please, PLEASE return to the previous version and the design of the items. | Love this game, just wish it would give out more free moves | Good so far. | This game is not working. I can not see anyting. | Fun | Used to love this game but now all it does is crash. Everytime I open it. | After downloading and quickly discarding a few now, I've come to realize I'm not a fan of merge games at all. Oh good gravy. Tried installing again and giving it another go, did update too, it just hangs at 35% while loading. Guess this game is not for me. | I like the game have no problem with the game üëå | I'm only on level 6 and board is filled up | Complete the daily challenge twice and you'll never be able to complete again without spending $20 per day. | A dull and pointless game that crashes way too much | Thanks for u | Interesting game | Enjoying the game. Would like change to trade gold cards | Super | Good | Pretty fun game once you get the hang of it! | Great | Disaster has struck. My game which was on Level 81 and I completed the Island, only had 1 standard card plus 7 gold cards to collect, when last night the entire game deleted and I was left at the very very beginning but with a user code that I did not recognise. PLEASE HELP TO RESTORE MY GAME. HELP URGENTLY. THANK YOU | I was playing with my old Gmail account but due to some problem I had to reset my phone and don't remember the password of my gmail....how do I get that game progress back...and new update has lots of adds...it distrub so much while playing...please check and help.. | Fun | It was fun in the beginning. However, when it became more frustrating than fun, I tried to start the game over, but it will absolutely not let you! Ugh! | Awesome to play with the kids. | It's not a bad game. It's kind of monotonous..... | Good | Great game! | It's good nothing much I do recommend you get it üòå | Won't load last 35% even after recent update. Your feedback is not helpful since it would have to load for me to get to the settings menu. | My game just restarted all of the suddenly I list everything I built for two years my heart is broken I don't know how to have my game back I lost all my data,, after my game is restored it not loading it stop at 92% sometimes when it finally login it freezing it unplayable and very frustrating | It's so bad I can't stand it long enough to get paid to play it!!! | The energy and diamond packs they give you used to be 7.99 and now they're 17.99 and 29.99. Prices just keep going up and the higher you get the more money you need to merge items because it takes so much energy to merge the items. Especially when each daily challenge starts to take 300 to 600 energies. | The best game ever ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è | It's addictive. | Barely started and already can't stop playing | I just ordered an energy box with my diamonds, and I didn't receive it. It takes too long to get those diamonds for them to get wasted like that. | Fun fun fun!!! | Hate the new design update. It looks tacky and childish now. Updated from 3 to 1 star because there has been even more tacky updates that completely take away from the aesthetics that previously put this game above other merge games for me. | Love this game additive. | Rating was a 5 until I realized that u can not go further with the game unless u buy energy otherwise u just have to wait way to long to make any progress and the game loses it's charm. The option of getting energy through watching adds is also limited and when it's over u just have to wait..Also there is nothing to do in this waiting time that could attract u to keep this game on ur phone | Love this game.. üéÆ | Sorry | Started off nice,but when you run out of energy and watch the ads for free energy,it jumps off, restart,and you lose the free energy and/or bubbles to continue playing,very irritating | Lots of fun and quite addictive. | When u get to the bunny they jack all of ur lighting points they charge to many bults and don't offer enough to get anywhere I have spent a fortune and get no where it's a scam I need to find a new game as soon as I'm through with what I paid I will never play this game again","{""1"":17236,""2"":2872,""3"":4309,""4"":2872,""5"":119760}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†26.99 - CZK¬†2,699.99 if billed through Play","5.1","5.1","VARY","Magmatic Games LTD","4765571944833116862","support@traveltowngame.com","https://support.traveltowngame.com","207 Regent Street,

It has the standard formula, make things happen, which costs energy, run out of energy, wait for energy to refill, repeat. You can pay to top up your energy. I'm sure the higher will take FOREVER to get done. The game plays well and looks good. It's easy to play and get into the meat of it. Minus 2 stars for not having any music. No music in a time-killer game is a huge quality issue. Games like this always have good music."",""The game is fun but after a certain level you'll need to spend money more than not to get through the daily challenges. What I find disrespectful is that they have an algorithm where if you spend money they increase the cost of everything until you go about a week without purchases, then they offer low prices. They need to offer better rewards for people that spend cash. There's also an issue where they seem to always give you more items that you never need. Not a coincidence, burns energy fast."",""Unfortunately, it's not like the ad. It's too busy looking, too many things on screen when filling orders for different item types. I have no clue why the interactive part is even there as it's basically talking to itself. You don't talk to others. Worst of all is the limited time b4 you must stop. Every few minutes energy runs out and you can't play. Really dumb. Not relaxing. The ad is false, but fun! I can play while I am getting points for other games. Uninstalling."",""Travel Town started as a fun matching game, then became challenging, then a waste of time. Minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 6-10 matching items before it recharges again. Over time,more matching items are needed to complete your order. You end up more waiting than playing. Of course, you can use gems to speed process, but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Power maximum is 100 and disappears quickly. Get rid of recharging. Thx"",""It's a fun game on the surface, but is the least giving when it comes to energy of any merge game I've played. Daily tasks are borderline extremely difficult if you're not setting timers for when your energy recharges or something. I'm lucky to complete one big item in a full day. It's an issue many merge games have and a few things have been added to combat that grind, but not nearly enough. It was fun for a few weeks or so.""]",false,false,false,"io.randomco.travel","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.randomco.travel&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Keep up the good work. | Those who review and own the app are great all these years I have used the app and appreciate my reviews | Okay | Awesome to share travel secrets with each other! Great app. | Good | Correct guidance | This is a very bad company to book trip from they canceled my trip and did not pay back the refund, I have been waiting for 4 months now and the only answer I keep getting from thier customer service is that they have escalated the issue the team will get back to you. And till date no one from thier team has ever got back to me and from past 4 months and my money has also not been refunded . They are only interested in stealing your money do not use this site for bookings ! | Best application | Absolute scam, persecuted small business owners into paying high fees for their premium business services with no return on investment and don't cancel the service even when requested. Then follow with illegal business practices to try enforce payments despite repeated requests to cancel. Making an official complaint to Google regarding this practice. | I always use this app when planning a trip | Helping tool to get perfect outcomes | A good trustworthy way to find the good stuff as well as the dirt on hotels. üòÅ | Why isnt my review appearing? | You're just loud üì¢ but useless ideas if possible I like to give you final notice for - minus ‚ûñ | Really Great Service | Much helpfull | Keeps crashing after update, totally unusable. Doesn't remember searches. If I could give zero... | I love that this is ""one stop shopping"" for anything and everything you need to know when traveling. It's all at your fingertips! It's also easy to use and to rate. I LOVE the fact it gives you suggestions of things to see and do in every city you visit and helps you find ""one of a kind"" experiences. The people who rate places seem to give more indepth information than other sites do and those ratings have made my trips so much more fun! I NEVER go anywhere without checking Trip Advisor! | The app currently works great, even better than the web version, in my opinion. Easy to use and stable | perfect | Grat app easy to use does what is says on the tin | Easy to navigate. Confused videos are still not allowed to upload. Dratz | Informative | Loved the AI trip planning | Always helpful to read other traveler's reviews. | This is one of my favorite travel apps | Used to LOVE it, changes and never the same | This is my go-to app for hotel reviews. It never lets me down! I use it when I'm abroad too. Being able to see customer photos of hotels is really important. I like visitor ratings too. | Gr8 guide!!!! Have been using this app for very many years! Just discovered that i've been a member for over 2 decades!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | Very good app | Very bad. It is show a very low price like 700 SEK then when i click on the option the price will be like 5560 or something like that. I delete it ofcourse | Can't save our location. No area map of search items. Useless phone app. | A must-have for traveling, dining, attractions, lodging, etc. Thank you! | A must have for travelers | Amazing platform for choosing traveling | Been using for many years.. | Sadly TripAdvisor listed the hotel I'm currently staying at is having a pool and it doesn't. I felt like I threw away $194. As a rule I find them very dependable but I'm quite disappointed in this circumstance cuz I would never have booked here had it not had a pool. | The best travel app | Great for finding and leaving reviews | Always use trip advisor, it's been very accurate | First class. | For me it is very useful app to be very updated about the best options to enjoy around the world. | Wonderful experience... | Great for checking out hotels to stay in when going on holiday. Decent for checking out nearby restaurants and tourists attractions. | Best App for travel tips | Good | Good | I've used this app for years and it works great. It's an invaluable tool for finding nearby attractions and places to eat. | The app is easy to use. It helped me found hidden jems during my travels, amazing places to stay which sometimes aren't available on popular booking sites. I mainly use to search accomodations in specific areas, highly rated by other travellers. | Good handy app, but there should be a translate button so we can read all the reviews | this is very nice for fashionistas and models searching for places | Experiencia recomendable | Trust the reviews listed and i find it is good to read previous guests views as not everyone will like the same place. | So difficult to do things. TripAdvisor stupidly opened a new Google-linked account (without asking me) when I wrote a review and won't let me (1) revise or update the review or (2) merge the new account with my other account that I've had for 14 years (since the promised merge email that supposedly expires in an hour never arrives). So I'll have to delete my review and start again in the correct account. It's not possible to simply move a review. I've wasted so much time. | Very beneficial!! | Try it and you will surely find it the best for planning trips. | Very bad it doesn't give business people an opportunity to talk about them regarding on other clients taking advantage in making a reputation for hard working like us a bad name for our even if we complain | So many places and so, so much information. We use it to get information and understand where we will visit. The information is invaluable. Thank you for the service and Thank you Contributors. | Always use the app to look at reviews before I book a holiday | Very professional | Most of the time it is spot on. Other travellers can be Muppets though | Used this app for a number of years and have always loved it but a recent update has changed the whole layout and I'm afraid it is unlikely I will continue to use it! | I recommend this app, cause it is very useful and easy to use. | I find that this app really fills the void of others. I like it because I can find tours, hotel transfers, accurate foodie reviews plus, wait for it, bloggers who will meet you and take you on a particular tour. And there are people in every country who do this. They may be pricier than ""Hop on- hop off"" buses, but you will see unique parts of whatever city you are in! | Would give this a higher rating but you can't edit reviews if you want to tweak them or see an error. You have to delete the entire review and do it over again. C'mon, in this age of technology, make it easy to edit a review. | I am Local tour guide in Tanzania and the App is incredibly amazing... i can share my reviews with pictures from different places i visited and help travellers make the good choices. | It is impossible to cancel a booking. The text they send you is a no reply and we only have WiFi at the hotel. I cancelled 3 days before the tour but they still sent me the ticket and charged me. | Very easy to use and love looking at other's reviews. | Easy handlimg, reliable source for finding nice places to eat, drink or stay! | The tours are amazing! | Easy to use | It's a great resource. I use Trip Advisor to find points of interest wherever I visit. Because the reviews are from fellow travelers, the information stays from that point of view not necessarily travel agents or venue owners. There's more practical information here. | This is amazing mobile app | very helpful wth everything üôÇ | Suoer | Easy to use | Took a break for sometimes as it wasn't user friendly for a while. Glad to check in again and it's nice to be back. Bravo. | It was working well, but now the save function is a bit broken.

And I make sure to always write a fair and detailed review after most all of my visits. Good service and products deserve recognition. While poor service and products deserve to be criticised. | Nobody uses this anymore, everyone is using Google maps for reviews. It is a pleasure to witness TA demise. TA just wants to sell you hotels and trips now. Nothing in their reviews is to be trusted, most users are dumb as a rock and review hotels instead of the app itself. A dead app, good. Updated, no improvements. Fk tripadvisor and his board. | Excellent travel app! | Love trip adviser | Amazing | That's very well apps... and I believe in this app my earnings | Sangat mudah dioperasikan | Very usefull app. Thank you | Awesome and very helpful | I've been using Tripadvisor I must say, it's truly outstanding.

My go to app before trying somewhere new!! | Trip advisor is getting too strict about any one adding truth about businesses. I want to know all the bad and good about a hotel i need to stay at. I want to know the bad and good about a restaurant i want to eat at. | Very easy and reliable app. Good customer service and peace of mind for potential cancellations. | My photo session with ""Two Crafty Cats"" was fantastic, she I'd such a fantastic job, I would definitely recommend! | Excellent | We usually use this app if in an unfamiliar location. | Wonderful for an Old Man Trying To Keep Up | Good app | TripAdvisor is all we used when we travel because it helps us to understand in depth what are we booking and what do we need to have the best experience! üòú | Booked 4 tours in PVR and all were a very smooth experience | Very useful tool | USALS couldn't even find the pub | Using for several years, Awesome, we traveled many may places, always had the inside scoop with TripAdvisor.

Many useful filters and easy to keep an overview about the offers and finished bookings. | They scam you and take your money. They lie about giving you a refund if you canceled | Kya | No help no way to contact | Very useful app , contains all great information | Nice platform | When you review hotels the app shows only positive comments about them and negative are hidden. I booked a very poor hotel because of that and lost 75 eur. | I am surprised that this hotel is classified as three stars. The service provided to me is five-star service. Wonderful employees in every sense of the word. All of them, without exception, in all departments. Wonderful employees. Many thanks to all of you. You are truly wonderful. The service was truly seven stars, not five stars. | Excellent | Been with you guys for awhile | Cheaper and easier to book through the actual hotel. This way you know your reservation is secure. Don't use Booking. If they screw up and don't confirm your room with the hotel, which they often don't, they will not help you resolve the issue. Replying to Bookings reply. I tried contacting customer service after I was told by the hotel that my reservation wasn't confirmed by Booking. Customer service referred me to a nearby hotel and claimed they would cover about a $20 difference. Awful! | So far so good | pathetic experience in india this app badically does nothing provides no option to its users to pay and book hotel also they dont have any customer care number if one wants to complaint about hassasment from hotel management | V good üëç | Easy and detailed | Find a room with the app but do not book with the app because if it is a problem with the booking you will be left without a room. No matter how good an app is to use without customer support it sucks. | Easy to book and guide to reach their | Awesome | Very easy and fast | Great its only app I use to travel | WORST ONLINE BOOKING EXPERIENCE. Do yourselves a favor and try other apps. | Very informative for scheduling trip. | This company is trash, they are happy to make you lose thousands of dollars. | I clicked in to get information about the property featured on your post. | Great app. Just add good pics of the site along with the information. | Extraordinary | It's better then using different types of booking app | it's a paradise for money laundering shady places and they don't even have a way to report them. | Excellent | Very pleasing . easy to use and very helpful | Easy to use and full of genuine photos, tips and information. Been using for many years with no probs so farüòä | Brilliant...thanks. | Very good. Many thanks | Easybooking | So many choices on budgeted or luxurious stays,either some offers no prepayment needed,in that sense it's so comfortable to make changes in last minutes too. It's so fun to use this app and I'm loving it.... | So easy to find good accommodation at good prices ! | Namal City tours Sri Lanka good | So far so good üëçüèæ | Great app for finding good deals and managing bookings | Excellent experience and good information. | great and unforgettable experience | I think,best app | This service is not worthy of 1 star also. They have taken my money and not refunded. So i cancelled a booking because of some emergency but the money I paid was never refunded. Very awful service. Never ever use this. | Excellent | üíØ | top! | '! | Good | Worst booking site I have ever used. Absolutely Rubbish customer support. You book accommodation and turn up to your destination only to be told there is nothing reserved. Trust me and use a different site for your holiday accommodation. Impossible to get your money back also as their customer support is impossible to deal with | Rip off, Got to hotel, they cancelled my booking by text and kept the money | Fast responce | Have used this app for traveling multiple times! | It look very lovely,met any tide clean , bigger nuff for what a I Ark for I was expecting a spair in my onsweet an didn't have one,other big room aircon leaked made room small,but yer ok | The experience was examplary good | Help centre are useless, won't accept or register flight booking number. | Wonderful | Good service always | Easy and user friendly | Good one | Listed a property in Ghana and had no option to link bank details to receive payments. Very inconvenient | False advertising. I am currently going through a nightmare with this company. I searched and booked for a place that doesn't accept pets. Once you get to the receipt statement you are then made aware by the sellers that pets are not allowed. I canceled the purchase within the same day and have yet to receive a refund or response. I was told to check with the seller but I have proof from this website that I canceled the same day. Automated system scam. Check with the seller before you buy. | Everything about it is very good | There is a weird large button in the middle of the transaction even when the reservation is for the future. It's seriously confusing. Otherwise the app is OK. | Great options I enjoy using the app they also have great customer service","{""1"":119750,""2"":30313,""3"":66105,""4"":399549,""5"":3356006}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Booking.com Hotels & Vacation Rentals","8601716327451933581","customer.service@booking.com","http://www.booking.com/apps.html?source=googleplay",,"http://www.booking.com/content/privacy.html","8601716327451933581","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OSr8skhGVmspz4WJQgjGcaFy1OkIJrd_Afr_X6a9Z4tAAtq4bDdOmxlCbSznf0UFxnai","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E5KnHRKvHXeeXM0G5_eaRtCH1LMUuEMZf-Xqy6S_eALm43sgnYS3qB3ohntJjvmsQQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N3K0M8zNjFCh3h_wSclqQNMR4DANjNKF1BOw-QWhvyb-SKi6Ua4fa3UU1W_5aczeMM0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DijJT2usidYH1ck0rFaTOW5OGob3v63_B23cddhEZU75sxVCVDLjQ6SPx96CQ5mT6RYh"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VnO5Eq90e4Sk2uto7LwBcirFYQxNrjcoG5NScfWaODfRAhmWNnaXrY4p3FvXYnerKDI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MCwVfEW9UBaUTtKBuPVaeb6cnmAKfOBiW7gqoflxi8tCHhD5iGP4dpO_5ISjAfNoiw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AZfZRPAIOyziLrRZ7sP-rFFx8R9m9dalfb4BatrGQmtmuGs2Ss3e4CVUai6qrxdUfMY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xmQKmCGhlfp0lBgE4ZxWKxX_8_MpYWM_fnFabVUqwFfcefJ1czfOoM9ZPr82rtU7dNA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QX5mkZ78-Ldxf8oSpVrZ6pabQrBcPCZ06zvVwdqlDNqX94VGckf5qaGvUMG9IJ7tXt4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sBGkzAwqxauVLN3eLzzvfB--wvEh61AhlnA7sgAXlQpn_MTZKqR0j-vhr3yiggOPOY""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Feb 4, 2011",1712271007000,"VARY","We added some important info about our properties.

Found the registration process extremely frustrating. Host is not the problem. Admin needs work to make process seamless! | Ultimate policies | Site is easy to use. | it's not easy to figure out how to claim coupons/vouchers for payment. Thinking it would be part of the payment process I clicked to continue and ended up booking using the wrong payment method (thankfully no cancellation fee!). it seemed almost too easy for payment to be taken, with very little chance to check over the details (unlike many other websites that ask 2 or 3 times to confirm)! | .o6 .the | I love how easy it is to find so many places to stay on here and how easy it is to book! However, the fees for Airbnb are super high. There are some that aren't too bad, but I can almost always find more affordable places to stay somewhere else. Honestly, just deleted the app because I never can find anything in my budget on here anymore like I used to be able to. | Muy buena experiencia,satisfecho,excelente atenci√≥n del servicio de ayuda | Works well for booking travel | Love that you can direct message the hosts and they reply instant and you can converse | Never have I had a bad experience, everything as described.. | convenient and legit way of booking | It's very unsafe to stay with some hosts, even when they have good feedbacks. Airbnb doesn't care much about your safety. Will never use it again! | My host and I had an agreement. And even though she had it turned off and didn't accept it I lost my place and AirBNB wanted to charge my host 200$ if she canceled with the person who took it. Customer service didn't care and now I have no place to go | Great app | its so convenient and efficient to use. | If you know what you want! You want Airbnb! Excellent!! | Customer service is horrible. We had to find a hotel because they kept insisting on the booking photos match photos i provided. Its one thing to show 4 steps its another to find out it was 3 steep flights of stairs. Some help they were, host wouldn't budge on the refund only got one night. | Looked ok but when I tried to book...it needed to confirm my phone number thru a code that never arrived. Maybe should go the email route. | Application is fine but doesn't really fulfil its purpose. Tried to book apartment for 12 days time multiple times and owners are rejecting payment and claiming that its not available. But this can be only Dubai issue. Location of properties can also use some tunning as some of them are showing to be in the middle of highways. | Won't let me be a host because of one thing on my criminal record from 12 years ago. Not only that, it's the only thing on my record in my whole life. Some times S happens. I'm not a criminal. I'm a small business owner. I do good for my community. I donate to my local sheriff office every year. I'm not a bad person. Garbage. | Easy booking & payment experience | Great listings!!! | Great | one of the best in use right now in my phone | Easy to use | The app sucks for many reasons. | Very easy to use love this app | Nice and Easy to do. | Airbnb is my go to for over night trips. Thank you | First time using and it's easy | Very fast and easy booking. | Genial | always find the best places for my trips, love the freedom and control you have to make the holiday your own | Excellent | Great | Great | I've been using airbnb for years. it's still great! | Easy to find the perfect place to stay for the weekend. | A++++ | Very convenient and easy to use | The app and the ID verification is a task. I have tried and uploaded 2 different government IDs, one pan card and 1 DL, even tried for my wife as well and the hell it's not going through. Forget the experience at the stay, getting the verification done is a hassle on this App. | Fees are cancer | Sweet üôÇ and awesome | Airbnb has made staying in Vegas affordable and super comfortable,I don't even use hotels anymore | Easy to use the app! | The app is insanely laggy now. It's unusable. | Convenient, quick and awesome! | Never works as well as the website. | Fast & Easy | As a 90yr old Male it was very easy to find accomadation for my trip to France on Airbnb, the only problem I have is supplying a clear photo. | Full of scam | Great | Good | Smells like dynamic pricing. Some accounts offer several flats in the city center. That is not how it should be. The fees are usually overpriced. Don't even try telling me it's to keep the app running. | Their refund process is horrible. You have to pay upfront, (even before the host accepts the booking) and if the host doesn't accept the booking your money is gone. The website and customer support will say 15 working days but I haven't seen a penny in my account. And it's going to be a month. | Works well but the map should be more detail to find for example stations easily. | Excellent | Easy and quick to book | Exceptional!!! Quick and easy, I love the reviews on properties... | Very quick and straightforward | Best best best | I have good a experience about the renting basement. | Very easy to use | Have used Airbnb before,and haven't had any issues. I love the privacy u get instead of a hotel. I will continue to use them again. | Just the worst! They always dance around the host forgetting that it's the guest who is making them money. You can remove your card but still they will keep charging you. And you don't have a right even to discuss it because they just keep closing the case. You are talking to one ambassador and the next one just makes the opposite decision. One told me that I can do the late checkout anytime, now even after showing all screenshots they charged me, threatened to close account and blacklist | Bad customer service. Either it is terrible AI or people with bad skills that copy paste the same thing over and over again. | I trust the Airbnb app due to most of the guests' experience | Why do I have to verify again? I've been a member since 2012 and all of a sudden I need to add a phone number but won't allow me to add my phone number because it already exists. I have to upload my id to verify myself as well? Almost seemed like the app has been taken over and I may be getting scammed. I've been using airbnb for more than 12 years and have booked small 1 bedroom condos to massive 7 bedroom villas. The verifying process was Ludacris. It made no sense. I couldn't even use my # | Excellent | Easy to use and love the app and places available to stay at | Very convenient | I'm not giving the app itself a 1 star, I'm giving customer service a 1 star. This has to be the worst experience I've ever dealt with. I'm constantly being sent to the wrong person, I've spoken to nearly 15 different people and nobody can resolve my issue!! And STILL they send me to the wrong people every single time. I guess the only way of getting my money back is to sue AirBNB isn't it? Smfh. | So far, so good | Is the worst app, they never take care about the client, I got robbed and drugged and they never take care about my situation, actually they gave all the reason to the host and even I had to pay to the customer money, this app is from people that stole your money be careful you can use better apps than this | Using it for more than six years now. Excellent alternative to book a place to stay. | I hate this app | Excellent | Airbnb works well and we have had good service and pleasant stays | Really difficult to use this app | Always satisfied | The app is so easy to use! | Great app great hosts | So far so good. Would provide higher rating however just booked and not stayed yet.. | Fantastic options where I've looked up to now | Prices are getting higher and higher, something needs to be done with these cleaning fees and other fees. | Phenomenal service! Hotels should be worried... | We got scammed by a host that had a completely false listing, we had to find other accommodation and Airbnb just charged us for the place, never gave a refund, and customer service won't even reply. I used the service for years thinking with the peace of mind that Airbnb would protect its customets against such situations, but now that it happened to me I know that they don't do anything and just take your money. | what is the point of Airbnb anymore ? prices are always higher than hotels . plus they always have too high fees | Great every time | Very good | Would like to be able to choose bathtub as a option. But decent app. | Love this app | The app is good overall, though the locations aren't accurate and not enough info about places, plus the property here is usually overpriced | This booking platform is awful and their policy provides no back up for the gust renting the places. I was cancelled after 5 months of booking my vacation for host wanting to price gauge and charge more and Airbnb did nothing about me loosing my place to stay for my family. They basically shrugged their shoulders and said they will investigate the host. Days latest the host had the same listing posted for 5 times the price with no repracaution. No discount was offered to book 5x the price. | Very easy with lots of options. | Ok | Excellent website and service. Highly recommended. | Twice I've had hosts cancel a day or 2 before the start of my stay. AirBnB has been largely unhelpful. Maybe a $35 credit and my money back. Then I need to find new, last minute accommodations that end up costing a lot more. Use at your own risk. | Wonderful | Filters are not working | Amazing OTA | Easy, fast, cheap | Aplikasi sampah yang merugikan konsumen, harus berhati hati dengan aplikasi ini | Great experience | Bad customer service. A host cancelled my stay, so Airbnb issued me a $25 rebooking credit valid for 3 days. Since I already booked an alternative stay before receiving the credit, I couldn't use it. So I wrote to Airbnb support, asking if they can apply it to the new booking I just made. They didn't even bother to reply! Just closed my case, without an option to reopen it. That's not how you communicate with your customers. | Charged me for a place I have never been at. Uninstalled. | Very convinient and good functionality | Very easy to use and let's you know the distance to the beach | Great app | Great | I love Airbnb! The only place I go to book our family trips! | Love it | Far out and groovy, solid even. Top shelf. | Pathetic experience using it in India. I would rather pay more and have hassle free experience instead of using AirBnb. India users please avoid using it. | Very very helpful, easy to use | It's great to have all this options at your fingertips with Airbnb.. | Very happy so far | I love the experience I'm trying something new | good | UNSAFE FOR WOMEN Had a horrible experience with Airbnb in London in a House where the Guest rooms had NO LOCKS, and the Host controlled everything from the heating to the locks . SHOCKINGLY Airbnb did not even look into the issue and closed it despite sending proof with images and photos. IF something goes wrong , it is SCARY since AIRBNB didn't even report the HOST. We thought it better to REPOST here since this could be happening with so many people and AIRBNB could be covering such HOSTS. | Very user friendly | I like this because it is easy to use and it has very clear instructions. | Used to be good. Last two times: location snowed out no refund, I had a funeral come up no refund (because I missed the window to cancel by an hour). Fool me twice... Edited: Please note - Airbnb reached out to me via this review with a canned response. | Excellent Very easy to use Thanks | Great app. Has been a life saver | Nice | Took away the month whole house feature | Amazing | Great user experience | Awesome experience! | Simple and easy to navigate through. | East to use. Fast booking. | So far so good | So easy to use and the app never fails or crashes. Support is fantastic. An all-around wonderful app. | Spot on every time cheers | The app is almost a scam. I wasn't given any compensation or refund when the street of the house was flooded unlike the other neighborhoods. And they also removed the negative review I tried to leave, and didn't give any chance to update my review. So the ratings you see for listings are picked by Airbnb. Dishonest business. | Very easy to use. Good cancellation policy | Always had positive experiences. | Never an issue finding a great place and living like a local! | The application affects global language settings in your account. And doesn't let you to change the language. And airbnb support team knows it. That's a really awful feature | great | Very bad experience | Very easy! To use app. | Very useful app and brings lot of options which are not available on other hotel hosting websites.we can book home away from home.love the app | Î≥Ñ 1Ï†êÎèÑ ÏïÑÍπåÏö¥ Ïñ¥ÌîåÎ¶¨ÏºÄÏù¥ÏÖò.

No I don't want to see homes in Brazil and I don't care if it's an a frame, camper, or tiny house. Shower them all, in a specific area?

Prices, locations, and details are very clear | Incredible app!!!! | Easy app to access and find great rental properties. It's probably one of the greatest business ideas in a long time. Thank you Air BnB. | Respect Airbnb for change their rules | Airbnb is perfect for our team to travel and stay together for our work trips! | Easy to use, but booking fees are too high. | Pretty much the worst customer service ever. I booked a space for the eclipse 5 months ago only to have the host cancel 5 days before. Airbnb said they'd extend me a coupon to cover a new accommodation regardless of prices as nothing is available anymore. When I agreed to that they stopped responding to me entirely. I would have been better off booking a hotel. | Very convenient | scammer hosts, robot cs. As a guest they will claim you are always at fault so that they can just take your money . | Safe and good | Quick, accurate, and easy. | The app is descriptive, safe and user friendly. | üëå okay | User friendly! | Broken app for verification. Does not work with Indian Driver license | Charging too much in the name of service fee. Unfriendly refund policies. | awesome app | So much better than the rest! | For some reason i can use the app with my old phone, Samsung J8, but my new Samsung A54 gives me an error, http 420. It doesn't let me open anything | It cant verify my face!! | Good app | Airbnb should make their website work. I was forces to download this in order to get an entry code as they wouldn't let me log in to their website. | Very easy to use as a host & guest | It is hard to navigate your map!!! | I have not actually used it but I love the browsing, and it shows me all kinds of places that I never even thought of going to see and stay in all night. So I will update when I actually use. But I am so excited to have this option! | Ez to booked place. My first time using Airbnb. | I've used AirBnB regularly since around October 2020 and it's made work travels so much easier. Always book with superhosts! | Best app for all of us to share happiness | Great customer service | I'm trying to reserve an Airbnb room, asked for a verification process, and for the past few hours it will not verify my last four.

At the end of the day, if the local tour company you buy through this app is a shambles, then that reflects on you guys. | Easy to use excellent | High khh | Makes it really easy to browse and book tours when travelling. | So easy to plan vacation activities. Great app. | Fast and easy to book | Great | Excellent app for tourism and travel expetiences | We had booked 2 tours from GetYourGuide in Vietnam. We took one of the tours but had to cancel the other. The tour was very informative and extremely well organized. The app is also intuitive and has a wider selection of tours than other similar apps. The customer support was also prompt and helpful, unlike apps like Viator. Even the cancellation process for the tour we didn't take was very smooth. Overall, I recommend this app for the quality & range of the tours & customer support | Amazing | Great options, easy to deal with | Easy to use, very quick, comprehensive info and cheaper. Can't go wrong then. | Cart on the app can't be in sync with cart on the website, no matter if it is under the same account. If you complain to the customer service, they just say ""sorry"", instead trying to work things out. | Love it | Easy to use and good prices | Good app, no app is perfect but this one has been the best for me | Great so far | The app is easy to use. Lots of options. | Beautiful | So easy to book adventure. | Good app design, good chat support, good merchants too ! | Lots of useful info in one place | Exciting way of learning different cultures | Convenient and reliable app | Have used it all over the world. Never a glitch and it's always been professional | Great service | Our Rome trip, we had plans to visit the Colosseum. Unfortunately, our flight was cancelled till the next day and they would not refund or make the visit for another day. This was a $535.00 loss.. We notified them just shy of 24hrs. They flat out refused, no attempt at all to help us. | Great app, very convenient to every traveller | Great spectrum of options, guides have been awesome. | The app is terrible. Tried to book an audio tour. Got an error message that the spots couldn't be held, go back to cart. Went back to cart, nothing there. Tried to reach via the support chat. It's a bot, and did not understand my msg. I tried calling the support line, but got disconnected. I sent an email, but that indicates that there may be a long turnaround. Also tried to attach a small image (204kb) of the error msg, but kept resetting the email page. | All I one place. Seems good so far | Too convenient. | Great app, all activities in one place | Good so far | Easy to use, great offers. | BEWARE! Tour operators are allowed to overbook tours and can cancel your booking minutes before the tour! Our tour of the Alcazar of Seville was canceled minutes before the tour due to Overbooking as we were walking to the meeting point. Unacceptable business practice! This monument books weeks in advance. We had no alternative to find other tickets in the few days we were in Seville over Easter weekend. | Very easy to view and book tours, must have | Most cheapest ticket !!! | Awesome deals | Excellent | Very useful app. Highly recommended. The customer service is very good. | Lots of your options. I've multiple times and without issue. Reasonable and usually cheaper prices. | Very good so far. Recommend | Exceptionally good! Recommend! | I booked a 1 hour 30 minutes cruise in Miami from this up wish I could take because I got late to the departure place. There was heavy traffic in the area. When I asked for my refund, they denied it for the company's policy. On top of that, I paid $36.00 for the trip where the place costs $25.00. They just stole my money. What a shame | Gr8 app. Easy to find unforgettable experience | Great deals! Best tours! | Tons of options | Brilliant app, great tours | We purchased tickets for Discovery Cove the night before we were going and never received our tickets in the email the said they'd be in. After contacting Jessie in customer support she told us this usual happens when purchasing tickets last minute. Yes i bought them the night before. Call it what you will. I explained that if they couldn't figure it out before the morning of the event I'll need a refund. Without any further explaining- they canceled my order. Horrible service | This is a great service. It was easy and safe to book. It's very reliable. | Everything I have booked through this app for trip to New Orleans has been wonderful! | Booked many times with get your guide. Trustworthy and easy booking | Have used Get Your Guide for Hawaii and Europe. Very interactive and informative. Easy bookings, downloads fast, correctly and best way to sight see as a group. We took buses and a rental car to follow some of the guides. | User friendly | Lots of choice and easy to use. | Very good value for money | Streamlined and professional appearance | Very efficient and easy to book | Quite simply brilliant for making the most of your holiday. | Easy to book...lots of good choices to pick from. Will rate again after I do experience which I am so looking fwd to... | Always a wide range of options for each location, descriptions are comprehensive and accurate, app is easy to use. | Wow | Very efficient service and excellent quality also excellent price. | Lots of great offers | Absolutely love this app! All you can do in one space and easy payments! 10/10 would recommend! | Great prices, great value | So easy to navigate | Two bookings and both get cancelled. 1. Due to weather, but I didn't receive any updates until I chase. 2. I had to chase for every single information and then trip got cancelled as the merchant wants cash payment. Unbelievable | Easy to use. Great to have your plans already laid out and paid for in advance so you just have to show up. | Always had fantastic tours, well organized | Looks good üòäüòä Lario | Easy to use, flexible payment methods, very informative | Its so easy to book the tour. | I use any time we're traveling. It's a great tool for discovering new and fun ways to explore a city. - Sarah, United States | Diabolical, couldn't find the tickets on the App but apparently email was sent the day before by the supplier, no signal or WiFi on Faber Mt by the ticket office so couldn't access emails. Ended up having to purchase two more tickets so we could enjoy our day. I thought all tickets would be on the app but basically it's just a calendar reminder and not much use to me. | So easy to book and use | Awesome | Get your guides have great tours when you are going to cities you never been | Great tours and activities.Malta or Paris | very convenient, easy to use! Best travel experiences app | I was unable to make a payment through debit card so I did with Google pay at last | Great app! Great tours and tour guides! Had a blast in crotia using this app and tours! | They cancelled my booking, at 8:00 in the morning(the day of the trip)when they changed the meeting point without informing us about it. I called them and they told me that the meeting point was changed. We went there and they did not wait for us. They just send an email with our cancellation without explanation. They lied to me with the cancellation reason of overbooking. Unbelievable, unprofessional and rude. I feel disappointed with your app and the company which organised this trip. 0 stars. | Fab! | Lots of choice easy website to navigate | With the best tour options and easy to sue service, you'll be sure to have the best trip! Thanks for an amazing Seoul and Busan experience ! | Easy fast secured | Booked 3 tours to Vatican & each canceled. Last one canceled bc they said GetYourGuide overbooked. Contacted customer service & they weren't able to find anything else to replace at time needed. I asked if discount can be provided on any of the upcoming 3 tours. They said discounts are for new customers only, they don't have anything for existing/loyal customers. I've gone on 4 tours in the last few days & it means nothing. Won't be using again. | The app is not needed to attend your tour despite the badly worded email. Just take your printed ticket. If you haven't printed your ticket, the app provides a paperless option. | It's a good way of booking things while on the go. Recommended. | Helped me book a taxi | Amazing app. | sometimes it Show errors | So easy to use. | Brilliant site. Loving it | Great app | Ok! | Very easy track and order tickets | Easy to order and use, the option to pay later is a plus to reserve your spot | Booked tickets from them and they didn't have the tickets confirmed with the vendor. Got a notice the day before that our reservation would not be honoured... | Brilliant. It comes up with excellent ideas. Easy to navigate and sign up for the various events. I would highly recommend. | I don't even want to give this a 1 star. I used this app for a dinner cruise for me and my daughter in Czeck Republic and it was the worst experience of my life. I left an hour early from the hotel for a15 min drive to the boat but got lost and arrived just as the boat pulled away from the dock. I asked for a refund and was denied. So don't waste your time with this app/boat company. They're not understand and the ticket last was rude. They are the worst with foreigners. Will never go back. | A very pleasant day with guide Takanari. Very informative and enjoyable. Taka is very knowledgeable and proud of his heritage. I strongly recommend him to ALL toursits wishing to know more about this beautiful and exciting city. I wish many success for all the guides in this app and I admire their positivity and professionalism. Keep it up! | Easy to book | Great tours | Good | Very good | Wherever I travel if I want to do some activities I always use this app. Always everything is simply perfect. Last year in Dubai I booked like 6 activities for 2 pax using the app. I had to reschedule only one due to unexpected health issues and I was brought to a hospital. And we did our activity the next day. love the app and the people behind it. Big thanks üòä üôè üòò | Thank you! | I used while in Europe and the bus tour was excellent. | Easy to use and quick response | Promptly | Easy checkout. Prices are lower than on viator | Very reliable guide service, gave us a private tour of Pompeii as we were only 3 that booked. | Many interesting and scam free guides, providing opportunities for many tourists to utilise this app and see what various countries hold to offer! | Booked for tours in Berlin,Malta, Gdansk. So far very pleased. | Excellent services. | Great :) | Made things easier for sure | Very easy to use. Show great options to take in activities and surroundings site tours. | Professional communication & good instruction | So far so good with bookings | Good | Amazing experience with the most knowledgeable tour guide Andy | We booked to see The Barber of Seville opera in a Venetian palazzo and had an incredible evening | I love all the options and ease of scheduling/ booking | Such a great app,easy to use | Easy to use & book tours | Very useful source for a lot of travel requirements | Very convenient app | Me and my partner went today for an excursion with Mohamed Baakena. Everything was perfect he proper took care of us and we had a beautiful evening. Sometimes, here we had find difficult to organise with timing and understanding the schedule, this was the only website that everything was explained and with time, we also find this very helpful. Thanks again Mohamed to share a bit of Marrakesh with us it was much appreciated. Anna & Chris | Used it just a couple of times, but so far working very well. | Really easy to use with every activity in one place | Great activities all over the globe | We have booked Airport transfers and 2 trips using this app. | Awesome | Simple and straightforward. | Very useful app, always helping. | Easy to access different experiences and book them | Very good app and very good offers | Great app | Amazingly good, cheap tours. We found this while we were in Colombia, booked all our tours through Get your guide. Very satisfied, would definitely recommend | Very handy for booking activities | My sister recommended this to me. Had good deals than Agoda. | Amazing and I couldn't ask for more during my international travel. | Usability before average. Changing from dollar to euro: error. Changing date of birth: the input box does not work. Changing from filter to lists and back and your filter had been reset. Saving filters not possible. Adding a keyword to your filter: not possible. Not able to select some very important highlights. In a favorite list, open an activity, press back: you are not in your list anymore. | Very convenient and thanks to the public reviews the tours are always good quality. | Very good | Easy to navigate | The best website for a guide | Easy to use | Cheap prices and can reserve and pay closer the time üëç | We used app for our trip to St. Augustine. Absolutely loved it. User friendly and loads of info and activities. Would recommend to anyone. | Every possible tour imaginable. | Easy !!! | Easy to use | Easy of use and user friendly. | Very easy to navigate and use | This app has made it so easy to book tours in other countries where they primarily speak different languages that I do. You can also search based on a guide that speaks your language. | Great app and easy to use | Easy to use , great options ! | Very convenient and often gives 24 hour cancellation flexibility, one does not get with buying tickets directly. | Easy to use. Very user friendly. | Good experience | Its pretty bad and cheap move that we need to install a 35mb app to get the QR code(lesser than a kb)after the booking. Email sent load of information but the simple QR code. Pure waste!!! | Great app, easy to plan different activities. | I love GET your Guide!, I have used it since it first came out, and have booked countless activities from Mont St Michelle to Pompeii to Windsor Castle, abd the Eiffel Tower. Multiple times. I want my bookings to stay in my profile, so I can use the tour I liked again. When we upgrade app, they seem to disappear. This would make it better. Thanks! | Get your gide ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for making our turkey holidays awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è & please guys always do with Get your gide Thanks and regards Renjith &uma | Loved it. | Used this bags of times, fabulous. | App is good functionality works fine. But whatever trip or activity provider some are not good. | Useless app more then expensive i didn't have good experience you can buy tickets there 1-2 hours before less cost | Impossible to get the tickets without installing the mobile app. | Easy, functional, suppose it's alright. | Good | GetYourGuide is amazing - I have enjoyed excellent excursions using the App. | So far, I have enjoyed everything that GYG has to offer, and it has been really fun and informative . | Easy to use, brilliant user interface | Always a great service. I have used this app all over the world & have never been disappointed. The descriptions are always accurate. I just booked a helicopter over the Las Vegas strip. | Really great value tours and very knowledgable guides | Absolutely bombarded by pop ups and advertising the moment I signed up. | Easy to use and very detailed information. Highly recommended | BEWARE! This is the worst app and very false advertising when it comes to its 24 hour cancellation policy. If I could give negative stars, I would. I purchased 2 tickets today for an aquarium and within 1 hour I tried cancelling but they said my 24 hour period ended yesterday, when I didn't even have tickets! Not only this app but the place lead you in false advertising. I wouldn't use this app again even if it is the only way to purchase tickets. SUCKS! | I've used get your guide in multiple situations on multiple continents. You can find a lot of really great deals and I'm not really had any problems. | Horrible HORRIBLE PLEASE DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THEM, NOTHING THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY NEVER PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR TICKETS AND THEN 14 DAYS TO REFUND YOUR MONEY AND IF YOU LIKE ME SPEND OVER 180 DOLLARS IN TICKETS YOU WIll be missing out on that money. | Very helpful and trustable | Booked hop on bus and river cruise in Prague. Excellent value | All good | Great adventure great prices if you need a clue or to save on your trip get your guide | So convenient to have my trips in one app. | Great service iv had trips in Dubai and Thailand and everyone has gone perfect | Quick and easy booking | A very unsatisfactory service provider i asked to cancel the reservation, cuase of my mother's illness, they asked to provide the medical certificate. Dont recommend to any one | What's this all about | NEVER use this app and use their service! We joined the tour under this app as it was recommended by Google. As I needed to use my wife's iphone to connect to the car, I needed to type in the Meeting Point Address instead of pushing the Show Direction Button below. The Meeting Point Address is wrong! We ended up in a remote village through a dangerous road. The worst thing is that GetYourGuide blamed us for notshowing up at meeting point while it is obviously their problem. No APOLOGY! | Easy to use | Experiences booked with Get Your Guide have always been great. We have never had a problem, and we have used them about a dozen times. The app is also very easy to use.","{""1"":3270,""2"":0,""3"":1090,""4"":4360,""5"":100283}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","GetYourGuide","GetYourGuide","apps@getyourguide.com","http://www.getyourguide.com","GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH

I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry.

And it's not one and done. They don't cover Southwest. Price notifications are useless | Reliable site | More convenient | hard to book a flight | Easy to use. | Me encarta esta aplicaci√≥n para mi es la mejor que hay | The app is okay. But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selecci√≥n). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change. I will absolutely never book through kayak again. | My go to travel app | Just updated to newer version... now useless. Can't do searches at all.. | If the app worked maybe I could give a more positive review | good service to have | great comparison site | Minghella Me..myomyomon | I cannot even get this to download. | Uninstalled .. After so many years of loyalty. I had to uninstall with heavy heart.

I tried several different cards. | Pire application. Affiche des prix qui ne sont m√™me pas bons.

I usually cross-check directly with the airlines - especially with overseas travel. | saves money! great app | Comprehensive and easy to use. | boca raton | made for usa customers. Not Good for the World community | Still my favorite travel site, but it seems not to have the number of specials from years past. Good people's when contacted, which is exactly what I've always liked about they're site! | great App | I tried this app once to book car rental and for some reasons the pick-up and drop-off time were pre-set to 12nn and can't be changed, we decided to book anyway. It turned out that the car rental shop closed at 12nn and we were not able to get our car but still got charged for the rental plus insurance. We also learned that Kayak outsources rental to yet another 3rd party/middleman company and getting a refund is next to impossible. Just book directly, don't use this app. | kayak is the best.. more places to choose from.. | okay for flight simulations | Rental car is scam | this app used to be better before the pandemic but now it's not the same. | Great app. it offers the best and cheapest flights | really good | Lowest price hotel was triple other sites, also would only allow up to 4 guests in a room where others have allowed 6 as we required. | Cool concept, but when it told me $1800 for a ticket I can buy directly from United for $900 for the exact same flight, I lost all confidence that I'm getting the best price when using the app. | The app deceives people, you can buy tickets cheaper on other websites. I was looking at tickets from London to Istanbul. They sell a ticket for ¬£192, but Pegasus sells it for ¬£113 for the same days and times. Same airport and airlines üòÅ | I Love It.Donna Spinner | Since I have installed your app, I have used only one time. And the reason is, because when I try to find more affordable tickets your green date are often more expansive then orange and red one's. I wander why.. | Now that Expedia and Booking have bought every competitor all of these great old sites / apps like Kayak are worthless. Too bad the FTC never blocked any of these takeovers. | good | Best travel app. | Is perfect | There is no boeing filter, false advertising. That was the only reason I considered the app. | it keeps crashing | best app in the w. | Fast and easy to use. | not recommended. | works great | Very uselful | Very good indeed | Garbage no prices are correct | great | works well | Great little handy app having all your travel info in one place. Would be nice to attach a photo to your trip as the cover photo to help identify it from the others. | using kayak for years. | I really only use kayak for tracking my flights. I've never booked any flights or hotels so I can't say how good that aspect of the app is. However I've had no issues with the flight tracker, and more often than not, kayak updates any delays before the actual airport. Puts my mind at ease when I'm travelling | I rented a car and if course my car vauture was refused and its not possible to have customer service with kayak. Gotrental com was the 2nd company and the actually renter is called Alizes . avoid all those company if you can | best for finding rooms and flights | Not easy to navigate | I used this website as per my friend recommendation to get the lowest international rate.I chose justfly to book 2 tickets.I noticed a discrepancy on my phone number, so right away, I tried to correct the number. I was told that it could take 2 weeks to process the changes. I haven't received anything til now. I tried sending messages again at #justfly chat,and this time,I was told to wait 2 hours for a reply via chat?!(WOW). This company employs some of the rudest customer service ever. | Good Search Engine for booking flights | Easy to make arrangements and planning. | Works as advertised, thanks! | It seems like not all airlines are included, e.g., Southwest, but most of them are included. | the best | Best price for your assistance and high quality!!!!Thank you so much,KAYAK service!!!! | Nice app | very good pricing with good options | Convenient and up to date withany options great price search for flights, easy to use very intuitive, many features , definitely worth installing the app. | Great with the exception that every single time I wanted to use the app it would ask me if I wanted to sign in. NO, I don't want to sign in! Stop asking!! So annoying. | I've been using Kayak to fly around the world since 2015 and it never lets me down! | where's the buy or wait feature in the app? | When are you coming out with a widget for android? I notice you have it on . not android? Why? Other than that, your app is perfect. I use it to track my entire vacation timeline | üëç | Whenever I purchase ticket never have problem at All yet€î | How come your flights are ¬£600 more expensive for 2 people compared to looking on the RyanAir site for the exact same flights? Other than I've been looking at those dates a lot on the app the last few days? | I found round trip tickets from NYC to Porto in June for less than $500 each. Great app!!! | great site | buena | Reliable. Easy to Use. Good Options. I have been using Kayak for years now, and it is my go to for all my travel needs. | Great app and huge time saver | Never ever buy air ticket by OOJO agency under KAYAK APP they are frome india country they are very bad english accent you can't understannd what they telling you they charge you $250 for each ticket you purchase it they not answer to your phone most of the time . if you want to cancel your ticket for any reason they not pay your mony back they keep your mony as credit for one year valid . i did open claim for oojo to get my mony . i am absolutely disagree and unsatisfying with OOJO !!! | really fantastic apps which recommended for everyone | The app doesn't load flights under Android 10. As well now also under Android 13. It did work a short period. Now major annoyance. I have to use the browser | ‚úÖ‚ù§Ô∏èüíó | Prices say they are down, but the don't change | Good app to compare several bookings sources but it's incredibly frustrating you don't show hotels with taxes and fees inclusive. Some of your partners like Super show a deceiving low price and add huge fees making it more expensive than more mainstream sites. But even the mainstream sites need taxes included to accurately compare which is actually cheapest. | Easy to use and trust full | very good app, syncing with itinerary works very well. i wish it would update the status of our flights and tells you which gate to go in real time. would have been nice. would even pay for pro for that function! | they don't have Bulgaria as supported region | Continuously timing out | üëç | Good app for Android | I started using Kayak and never found a better site, so I never left! I love the alerts when I am shopping for cheap or best flights. thank you Kayak for being my wing-man! | good | Very good üëç | glitchy AF | I guess this app is only for US domestic travel as it cannot find flights to, or hotels in, the Caribbean. | Great app for looking up and comparing airplane ticket prices. Haven't had any issues with the app | I find it's very difficult to cancel a booking through this app | Bloatware | the best travel app for managing your vacation plans. I wish it has the ability to search by multiple arrival and departure airports like you can on the webapp | no use of this app. I am the first time customer. | This company is worsr of the worst I trai to change a flight and they charged me double, I pay for the ticket 1300 üí∏ and to change the date of flight I supposed to pay 1100 more.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential. If you could export to a cvs or cvv for spreadsheet that would be amazing | New version won't let me sign in. | Very helpful while travelling , and you have a busy schedule | ever since giogle stopped trips, I have been lost. trip-it saved me | Lets have an app scan your entire mailbox for 'just your travel data' aha ... Because that's bound to end well, with the inevitable data breach... | Works well. Easy to use. | excellent | ‚ù§Ô∏è | Doesn't work at all anymore. Can't even login, keeps giving me an error | great | Must improved since last I rated it two stars in 2017. It however has slipped again. My properly imported rental car plans always randomly change between filed and unfiled. This makes things difficult when using the widgets | Too many bugs | Great for documenting your confirmations for airline, car rentals, dinner reservations, but not for planning a trip. I was hoping this app would replace Roadtrippers for me. | used it once before and found it again. worth the money for the pro version | Love the fact that you can make a very detailed itinarary with a visual timeline that makes it easy to keep track of everything. | THE BEST travel organiser app. | Best app üëå | Everything I book or event attended is added to Tripit for future reference. | Very helpful in keeping track of everything on a trip in terms of flight status and hotel confirmation. I've been using it for years and never had any problems. | Impressive but not perfect. Need to add feature of more than one email address because not all my travel info goes to the same email address. | The app has been great but just stopped working. When I try to log in it just says access denied | great product keeping all travel details together | No search function (iOS has it). Flighty level details would be nice. They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world üåé and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers. | Hello. I can't invite participants via email. A message appears that the requested email cannot be attached at this time. The point is that there are emails with which there is no problem and there are those that do. I did a few tries and it seems to be completely random. There was an attempt with two emails that managed to connect and the second time, with the same two emails, I couldn't. How can it be fixed? | Excellent! | make my travel easier | The pro version is a must for frequent travelers - it makes your travel logistics much smoother! Basic things like letting you know gates changes to baggage pickup carousel numbers before airlines / FIDs can. Subscription cost paid for it self for me when it alerted me when a cheaper rate rate on same flight came up, with clear instructions on how to secure. It worked and saved me hundreds for our family vacation! Update: now saved my thousands over the years with the Fare Tracket! | Good yahha | Great . | it's very easy to use and links easily to trips. but I can't seem to set custom picture for trips which isn't great. I tried following their directions but it still doesn't work. | Keeps on signing me out and then having to reset my password and won't let me sign in on more than one device which is a pity as the app looks good | love it!! | Extremely helpful | The application is excellent, but unfortunately, I have encountered a technical issue where it repeatedly crashes. | The app will not let me log in. I Created a password but the app freezes when I tap the submit button. | App was recently updated and google login no longer works in app (does in website). | cool travel üß≥ app | Useless | such a great app. we travel a lot and it's indispensible | My flight on American Airlines was delayed twice and AA rebooked me on a different connection, but TripIt Pro never updated my itinerary, even many hours later. | Live & die by this app for travel, domestic & international. I've been using the app for over a decade. | does has list of all the cities and station in India | Very useful for trip planning!!! | Could be better | Love this app, mad glitchy though. Only thing is, when you share the itinerary with someone's email some details are left out. And they can only get an updated list of plans if you resend it via email or download the app. | Upgraded to the newest version and my past & future trips that were in the system have all disappeared. Have had multiple issues logging in from the mobile app, it opens the login into a browser then doesn't connect after entering all login info. | Crashes and does not save the IT I was trying to add. | Verry bad | 1-2024, keep getting denied access from phone and laptop. 11-2022 Not saving any itineraries correctly and supper buggy; keeps crashing. When it works it's great üëç | I have two long trips coming up, each involving a couple of train journeys and a couple of ferries. It got the dates right for one of them, and was off by a year for the other. It didn't pick the ferries up at all, and only found one of the train journeys. I'll stick with paper printouts. | For some reason, the app does not open and does not load once I enter my username and password; I can only use it on the website not on the app ; I have a Xiaomi 12 Pro. | App crahsing | I'm unable to sign into the app. I can sign into the desktop version. however, when I try signing in via the app it says ""an unexpected error has occured"". | Super helpful. | Horrible customer service!!! (or lack of) have deleted it after three emails with tech issues and no one getting back | Very handy app, the import function via email works well. Would be good if you could show a trip as cancelled status but leave it in the list so you can keep the details for future reference. | a great way to organize your trips. super easy to use and convenient | excellent app for keeping itineraries, tickets, bookings ect. | I love how easy it is to find all my travel info. Trip it not only automatically pulls the relevant info, but it also organizes my trip into an itinerary. My husband and I both use the app, and since he travels for work a lot, he can just forward info, and it gets organized by TripIt, and I can access it if necessary. | Don't waste your time with this one. It's a pay yearly at a very high price. Save the the money for your trip, there are better apps out there. | best travel app ever | very convenient aop! | Lousy app | Can't install nor update in Japan | Keeps crushing on a galaxy s22 ultra. On Huawei 30 pro works and I like it | This app has been very helpful in keeping track of my travel plans. I've only used the free version so far but will probably upgrade in the future | going to be using it on upcoming family vacation. Used it for a mini vacation and I never lost track of our plans and tickets or even confirmation numbers. I need more reference to give it any higher or lower of a review. | Free and works reasonably well. But too many trips are not automatically uploaded and I need to do it manually (even from main travel agencies like Expedia). 3 stars because it's free, otherwise it would be a 2. | I've used Tripit for years, mostly because there was no alternative. (1) It looks like with Tripit Pro you must have auto renewal -- no way to remove credit card so you must manually close Pro account. (2) No ability to add expense items during trip. (3) Long distance rail arrival doesn't display correctly on itinerary. | Very tiring logging in process Forced to uninstall it | This app is great for frequent travellers, easy to use and very convenient, stores all flight and hotel details, highly recommended. | Great organization travel app. | Been using this app for a number of years, and love it! | pro abit expensive | Can't always recognize absolutely everything you email it... A minor gripe as it's easy enough to input manually | Highly recommended for frequent flyers and travellers | This app is a great way to organize your itinerary as you build it. | you always know what to do next | It's ok let's you put all your trip info in | great program | it has very limited options | Great application. | awesome software! | the free side is great for planning and tracking...if I traveled more I would buy they full package | I've been using Tripit app for over 15 years. one of the most useful app for travellers | This only let's you sync your email and then it ""makes an itinerary"" for you. I was looking for an app that allowed me to make the plans. | Trips sometimes don't get updated | greattttt | Such a cool app. makes traveling easy. | too many forms | Erroe everytime | The app makes it so easy to manage all the details when traveling. | My travel life depends on it! | love the app, however recent issues are: unable to upload PDF or use camera functions. only uploading photos from camera roll is working. | brilliant. | Interactive airport maps have not worked for some time on Android version and does not seem that tripit team is addressing in any way | Really helps! | Great app | App gets stuck when trying to delete a PDF attachment from a flight in an itinerary. Android, Pixel 8 Pro | awesome | Worst app | I've used this app for many years and it has never failed me! | easy travel app for organizing and information tracking | I'm recently retired and this is perfect for my wife and I to keep track of all of the excursions. | For forcing me to rate you | App is good idea in theory but has some major concerns which render it useless. 1) FlixBus emails do not sync with TripIt, both automatically and manually. FlixBus is the most used bus service in Europe and North America so this is a problem. 2)TripIt stopped syncing with my email after the first week. 3) No layover option for ground transportation. How?? 4) All of these concerns were brought up in a help ticket and their response did nothing to resolve the problems. | The description of the app free version clearly states that it helps to share plans with others. But the feature of sharing the itinerary and invite others stopped working. The app send poorly designed email with part of the itinerary, broken images and no attachments. Moreover, it is impossible to add Notes to some plans despite the presence of the corresponding buttons. Sometimes it loads for ages with no result (e.g. when you want to rename an attachment) | Very poor app | Suddenly lost my access and unable login, unable receive any reset password email.

It's great app for us to see what he is doing. | Easy to use and a great to record your travels. | I love the app and it works great generally. I am documenting a year long journey and i can recommend it! Ome issue ive started to have recently is that it wont log me in and gives me an error. Sometimes its a few days like that before it works again. What causes this? It makes it hard to document my steps at the moment. | Love using this app to see other people's journeys and to diarise ours. Easy to use. | I have loved writing my steps down in this app , can't wait to get my thialand trip printed up in a book too , my only trouble is half my family and friends won't download the app to follow me , but hay ho who cares x | Great application, have been using it and I love it. They should add a feature for when you travel in group, we all want the journey on our profile and we have to duplicate the work. Hope to see that soon, I'll give 5 stars. | The app is great and easy to use. However, pictures and videos load very slowly (especially videos). Videos load slowly for us users and to our shared recipients. Please improve your video load time. | Absolutely fantastic app. I downloaded this app for our 7 and half month Europe campervan adventure. Its tracking our every move and displaying it on a map, exactly what we wanted. You can mark places you've stopped/visited etc and then publish it, which means it's saved. You can also add photos if you wish. Thank you for a fantastic app. | Very cool app, exactly what I was looking for! The only thing it's missing is the ability to have a collaborative trip, where you can add other people to it, and you can all add pictures and notes to the trip! Like a shared album. - that would be next level! | I have already printed four albums from my trips and I am about to order the fifth one. It's really easy to use and it's the perfect way to remember your trips. | Great app to keep a little travelblog for your loved ones back home. It tracks where you've been on the minute. You can add steps every so many minutes, great when you want to add a little sidenote in-between. The post and comment sections work just like any social media platform. Edit: One thing I would have actually liked to see added is the ability to like comments. (i.e. having a (select) option of emoji's to react to comments directly, instead of having to add a comment yourself) | I would give it a 10 stars if I could. Such a good idea, to collect all your travel memories in obe spot | Extreem mooi en handig gemaakte app! Zeer content mee :) | Still learning, but so far, I'm enjoying using this app. | Keeps my wife and I connected to our precious kids as they have fun in Europe. we live vicariously through them in NZ | Been using this for my RTW trip and it's great, a little travel diary, and also so close friends and family can see how the trip is going. | Made keeping track of our trip really easy | Used Polar steps on a previous vacation to Thailand and Vietnam it is an amazing app to chronicle all your travels and offer a book to commemorate all of your adventures in. Love this app | Love seeing the adventures of friends and family so quickly, easily and geographically | Great app to store photos show family where you've been and to track your travels, excellent | Love watching family and friends travel. | So easy and fun to track your travels and keep family in the loop | Amazing.. wish I had discovered it ages ago | Watching my sisters trip in easy and fun way. Would be better if the comments could be on specific pic and not the whole batch of pics. | Super handy app. You can even make photo books from all your travels afterwards. | Ottimo | Perfect fect for logging your route with pics. Would be Great if it was accessible for people to access it with social media that didn't have the app. But quite brilliant all the same... | We've been using it for 6 years. Reliable and easy way to track travel, add photos, and produce good quality photobooks, full of great memories. I particularly like the added automatically generated details, like the map of all travel during the trip at the start of a book and the temperature and location details for each step. Plus, it is easy to share with family while travelling so they can privately keep up to date on each trip. We've never looked back. | Just Excellent | really good to let your folks follow a trip | Having used the Polarsteps app previously, I knew I just had to record my current trip to the Australian high country and the Man from Snowy River Festival. When I received my Travel Book of the trip in my motorhome from Coffs Harbour NSW to Perth WA I was astounded at the quality of my book and how it captured the trip so beautifully üòç. My travelling companions also thought the book was fabulous. App is easy to use, and I love it üòÄ | Great | Great app! Fantastic way to track our trip x | Best app üíØüíØüíØ | Fabulous way to follow the travels of my daughter every day. I look forward to her posts and photos and feel like I'm travelling with her. It's wonderful!üòä | A really good app for recording your journeys and holidays. Really simple and user friendly. | Great app for tracking! | Great way to track my travel. | Incredible app for tracking multi stop holidays / travels. Very simple to upload and crop photos and videos too. | While travelling it's a really great app to keep your friends and family updated where you are and what you're experiencing. I was able to send a link to those who I want to be able to read the blog. Polarstep is really easy to use and I really like it. | A fabulous tool to document your travel experiences! | Great app for sharing travel experiences with friends and family. Easy enough to use and edit, map showing places visited is very nice touch. Slight improvement could be to make uploading photos easier. | Great to follow loved ones | By limiting our posts to followers only, this app is a secure way to share travels with family members in real time. | Truly my favourite travel app. Spend some time on updating this as you travel and you will have the most amazing travel journal that you can print in hardback. cannot recommend this app enough! | When you have a traveller in the family, it's a great way to follow their experiences. | Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è | It's a good app, I used it all along my travels and loved it. U can make little notes and pics alongside to keep a trace of what and where you've been. The only thing I'd like to notice is the impossibility to duplicate a trip you've done. It's not possible then to keep an original copy of your notes. | Great app as I'm not a FB person.. | Love using this app to track my journey and follow other friends A very useful app to create memories of places that you can share with your friends | Perfect | Great, easy way to record our travels and share with family and friends | Polarsteps, my travel companion! What an amazing app!! In the future you could add features to the travel stats like number of unesco world heritage sites visited and more. There's a lot of potential in this app. Please bring back the old flags design, those new flags in circle look strange in my opinion. | Brilliant app for keeping in touch with lived ones while travelling, for daily diary and for photo catalogue of trips. Excellent | I'm new to this app but it was recommended by friends and I'm loving it. | Great for recording and sharing trip details. | Really helps me capture the details of my holiday. By posting once a day I can keep on top of things and capture all the good stuff. Love the simple, well thought out interface. | Very useful and relatively easy to report on each step. It would help if it didn't jump back to the bottom after making an edit to the text. | Great app. Have used it for many years & really love it | Absolutely tedious. Someone recommended an app called Been but it got awful reviews on Android so I checked this one out instead. They're not really at all similar. This app is so tedious to input your locations of travel. It insists on you compiling your entire trio and adds in travel lines from point to point. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to just have one map up that shows all the places you've traveled, but instead you have to open each trip. The app lacks intuitiveness. | Great ap!! | Nice app to log your travels and make visible to your relatives | Can see exactly where my son was when travelling abroad. Very reassuring | Fantastic! | Great app to give family and friends a better idea as to where u are. Able to add pictures and also extra steps along the way. Quite happy user, although the down side is that i cannot reply to individual comments, only a general reply. Also I wanted to add that it would be great to be able to choose the mode of transport in between 2 distant points as it automatically defaults to plane even if it actually is a train travel. | Staat of valt met de inhoud natuurlijk. Maar een verademing in vergelijking met andere sociale media. | Love this app. I've been using it for years. Would be helpful if you could see a bigger photo when creating the book on a pc. The tiny picture isn't helpful! Even more helpful would be that you could edit the photo withing the website/app! | Excellent app for keeping our family updated on our travels. | Great app with good user experience to share my trip to my family and friends üëå | A great app to see the travel blog and photos of family travelling in Asia. You can really zoom in to the exact location they are staying (I guess they have to be in an area with internet) | Polarsteps is a great way to record your travels, include photos and videos of what you have seen. A great way to share with your friends and relatives as they can track you on a map of the country you are travelling in. It would be great to be able to choose a mode of transport and also have a leaving time, not just arrival time. | Brilliant app and can't believe it is free. I have been using polar steps for about 3 years and it is a great app that does exactly what it is supposed to. I don't know how they can keep it free but if it wasn't I would pay for it. Our family follow our adventures every year and we love looking back on our travels to remind ourselves of what we have been up to. I highly recommend it. | My favourite travel tracker. Very easy to use. | Great app | Great for tracking your journey. | -Wonderful way of sharing the journey. | Interesting visualization of following somebody's journey. The UX however can and needs to be improved for editors. Multiple times I've lost some carefully drafted texts and had to start over again. Also numbering the Pictures and being able to include a short description would help the viewer to follow the journey. | Love the satellite tracking and travel stats. Very useful travel diary. Keeps friends and family up to date on your journey. | A great way to share our travelling experiences with family and friends. Text editing is a bit glitchy, but apart from that it's an easy system to use. | Great app. Easy user interface. Location service doesn't drain battery much at all. A little more functionality would be amazing but for a free app it ticks all the boxes. | It has taken a bit of time to get the hang of it.. But now find it really easy to use | It takes a bit of time to get used, but it's very good. | Great app, easy to use and upload photos and trip info. Our friends and family enjoy seeing our updates | Great way to follow our sons travels. | Easy way to note your trip and inform homies.. | Easy to use | It keeps crashing on me. So frustrating as Ive lost my trips. | Great app, simple and easy to use. | Easy to use following someone on an overseas trip. | I have to say this is the best app I've ever used. It's easy to use from the outset, easy to edit, save drafts and upload pics and videos as well as making comments to other travellers too. I particularly like that you can highlight recommendations too, such as restaurants, with links to apps such as Trip Advisor...brillisnt. I'm about to order an album too. To all the developers involved...5 Platinum stars. | Polarsteps has made documenting our Ultimate World Cruise fun. Friends and family enjoy traveling along and I don't have to deal with the social media trolls. Hopefully future updates will enhance book formatting options. Great job Polarsteps. | Fantastic way to keep people at home updated on travels, additionally serving as an easy to use diary platform to help reflect on and digest your experiences. | All good üëç. | Great platform to record trip for friends and family, easy to use and navigate | Very addictive (in a good way) and greatly designed app. Tracking works very well and does not drain your battery. Try it! | Super app to keep track of your travels. | Absolutely great for seeing what loved ones are up to and where they are. | Been great to follow the journey of friends. | Absolutely brilliant | Love following my daughter's trip this way! | So far, l have only followed my daughter, but it is great to see the different places | Seems great so far | It is a realy nice app to let your friends and family have part of your travels, without needing to call them every day:) | Nice way to follow friends. | A vivid and visual way to describe your trip to others. | Lovely interface to follow people on their travels | Great app to catalog experiences throughout a trip - and to share them with others. | Love this program!! I order a hard bound copy of all of my adventures to keep my memories in one place. Use this whenever i travel. The new guide feature is handy for finding things to do too! | Can't rate this app highly enough. Our son is travelling across east Asia and friends and family have been able to share in his travels through photos and regular updates. It's a lovely and non intrusive way to keep in touch and will act as a lovely final travel blog. | Love this app, I'm using it for travelling at the moment but I really wish there was an option to caption photos individually! | Beautiful app, really useful both for private tracking or sharing or public sharing. Tr√®s belle application, excellent pour partager son voyage en images et videos. Peut partager publiquement ou de fa√ßon semi priv√© ou simplement garder son historique de voyage. | My go to whenever I travel , its one of my favourite apps | Amazing app, can't believe how brilliant it is, wish I'd heard of it years ago. Brilliant record of our trip to South Africa from Scotland. | An excellent app to track your trips and letting your friends and family be part of the journey. It's great that you can share locations, photos and favorite spots. Would be amazing to be able to create a shared trip with the person you're travelling with so both travellers can upload pictures, etc. üëç | Nice app for keeping track while traveling. I wish there was an option to add captions for specific phptos. Also, a possibility to edit and write descriptions on the laptop and justbon the phone/tracking device. | It took a bit to work it out but now I am very happy with Polarsteps and so are my non face book friends. | Very good app! | Love the idea but the app is not intuitive. I've been trying to add the location to the trips and still have no clue! | Great way to let friends and family track your travels | Great app family can see we're we have been. | Great app, amazing for planning my trips with the guides and keeping my memories alive! | Following my friends' World cruise and this app has been amazing and kept me up to date daily as my friends post their experiences. | We are using this app now for over 5 years and we love it. The collection of our Polarsteps travel books is increasing. One of the things we love most is the way it shows where you have been during and after your trip, both in the app and in the book. | Perfect to record your travels! | First thing it did was demanding me to create an account without first telling what the app can do for me. Many apps do need your info so they can pester you with advertising emails. Uninstalled immediately. | It's a really good way to capture and share travel experiences. The editing is a bit primitive, with the screen leaping about, but otherwise 5*. | Brilliant | Great app for documenting your travels and keeping memories, and allowing others to follow and share. | Great | A very easy app to use.So lovely to follow your love ones on their travels. I've got all the family using it, even the Seniors have the hang of it.. | Nice idea, doesn't allow u to update photos if the dates are not current. And every 15 second it notifies me that I need to share my contacts ... Not ver intutive and the UX is poor | Super concept | Easy to follow friends and family on their trip | Love it ,fantastic | We have been able to follow our son and his girlfriend's amazing journey and see their photos along the way. It really helps to keep up with their travels! | Great for keeping the family informed. | I am using this app on my open end world trip and highly recommend it! | Great app to use for documenting travels, just what I was looking for! | Great way to stay intouch | I really like this application because it allows me to have track of all my trips as long as add photos and descriptik of places visited. Great plus that it works offline and share to social networks is easy. | This app is exceptional, it's so nice to see where friends and family are visiting in the world and to correspond with them in real time. | Poor menu navigation design. Every time I scroll through foto's in a step and I go a millimeter up or down instead of left or right and the foto's drop away and because of the menu design I have to scroll through all the foto's again and it will happen again and again. Please fix the UI! I did find out later I can mitigate the problem by scrolling through photos fullscreen. Otherwise I think it's a good app, | Great app. Recommended to friends and family | Love this app, family can follow and share our holiday. | I love this place that allows me to track my steps as i travel | Used it since 2022 and recorded about 5 trips. 10 days self drive round Iceland: On a cruise ship across the Atlantic; Cruise ship to Antarctica etc. To save data, you can post a few photos to mark the location first and upload more later. | Excellent | Until now, I am satisfied with the App. But I should say it's not easy at the beginning to understand how it works. | Excellent app | I've used the app for several years now and its functionality has improved in that time. I use it as a travel diary to track where I've been and share stories with friends. Unhappily very few of my friends use it. It's a great alternative to FB for those who want to share or track travel info.","{""1"":2528,""2"":1516,""3"":505,""4"":10618,""5"":68259}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Polarsteps","Polarsteps","support@polarsteps.com","https://www.polarsteps.com",,"https://www.polarsteps.com/privacy","Polarsteps","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OoGygeN5QPb0boLM9ljuPrmYNqWK4FidNKiRVEvnevJbBd5tUvpCslQnnPkJyvEfnLSa","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kVO82NAqtE54gagBirYZ1IgXDgN_Ax7uNMjRhQTTCtn2GGo2-rB3VgxFBu6iI7X-IVMX","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IofTUFztBVIqxgZYkkOwqfLLoewF6TJXCoUVOEmUkaEU4x9e0H8k2KvyO5XOIGtomw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pj89FzQ9nI5tAUkCvYvz-jCjBBpARyj_iYhQfVk4b5nJkxDLWTEiSUXBaJsdJ6BZbKC5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WS_tGHckn8tOcSYjvbb66GK3fl5bUeE--MOLSd3O9El9LBfJ8Dz1COImSiMhkyv7cA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5ivaZHITQW1Z0ih870grcZS4DM1OQJ0yFLI0vmHq6d0wXQE2lkSt3cvhyL-xGFZtwO2-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sRwn5zcHEQooHFDGo5Ve34HsLVY1nnkWLLuZiuGDlwdlc7PQrR6I__V968veO27JQLV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ejx00g0PlCm_sz1LMrqx_6wY7jCRCsi0XxFPuBuQ_Lioq_aOGxIfgNFBAZAs5O8DIZg""]",,,,"Parental guidance","Parental Guidance Recommended",false,"Sep 28, 2016",1712044019000,"7.1.11","- Explore the adventures of your friends!

The app is a great way to organize the trip plan in one place, and while on the trip, to navigate from place to place through links to Google maps. Fantastic tool if you like to be organized and plan out daily itineraries. | Great app for uploading itinerary. The dates and activities could be better formatted. I love the uploading confirmation emails to the app for it to automatically update the page. Also, love the trip recommendations. So useful. | amazing | WOW! This is a fun, very easy and useful app to use. I'm still testing and am planning our itinerary for an upcoming vacation. Wish list: 1. Add a search function so that I can find things in my overview, itinerary and notes. 2. Add export function to Google Calendar. 3. The expense sharing function does not handle changes in currency. | Excellent tool, even though the importing part can be improved...it helps a lot to organize and visualize your trip | just try whoa its blow my mind its a great app | cool planner | Awesome application easy to use and very informative üëç | really helped plan our trip to Japan with 4 other people. made it super easy to see people's suggestions and then make an itinerary with it | Installing app for the first time. Also I am not able to skip the subscription page. I don't need the features which come with the subscription. I just want to use the free version. Even if I click the X on the top-right, I return back to the previous screen. I simply don't want to leave my credit card info. | so far so good. | Good apps! | I'm so glad this app exist | The app has a nice user experience and you can insert everything you need in one place. I don't know if it's my phone but sometimes it gets slow to use and i have to wait for the command that I get. | LOVE THIS APP! Organize places by type and see places or itinerary on the MAP! So helpful in planning, and sharable itinerary ‚ù§Ô∏è I will be using Wanderlog for all of my trips moving forward!! | This is my 3rd time using this app for my trips. Easy to use. Recommended. | The functionality is good but the app feels slow and clunky when you move things around. Itinerary view is not easy to scroll and you can't just move from places to visit to the itinerary section. | Love this app! Makes trip planning so much easier! The only thing I'd ask for is if they could add Naver Maps for Korea, because it's almost impossible with Google Maps, some of the restaurants or cafes you want to go to don't exist. But apart from that, it's a great app! üëç | Overall a great app to really help plan and group things. However the app is quite clunky at times, especially when wanting to ""rearrange"" places or notes around. It scrolls back up to the top and sometimes holding and dragging the item gets laggy and becomes annoying. I would use it again but these small things could do with some improvement! | Excellent app! This app was a huge help when planning my big trip to California with my friends. This app made it so easy to plan all the travel destinations we were planning on going. This app has so many good features like offline maps and adding hotel and flight reservations. I love all the features it has and I highly recommend this app! | Very easy to add places and rearrange. I would have enjoyed a longer description of the landmark was attached to each site. Each day was color coded which was very helpful. | helped to group activities together | First time using app. Will never travel without it again. Fun, interactive way to trip plan. Instant win. | absolutely fantastic app. I use it for all my trips | Very good app with a lot of great features to help plan your itinerary | Helpful to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip from flight, rental car, places staying, coordinating activities and restaurants. This was especially helpful for preplanning with a traveller with Celiac disease. | Very easy to use, and incredibly convenient. | very comfortable and helpful! | Nice and easy to use. | awesome | love the app. been using it for the last 4 months to prepare/plan for our family trip in June. it's cool you can budget everything out, add hotel reservations, attach event tickets, and split the budget up if needed. searching the map feature for things to add to your itinerary is so much fun! | Very nice and easy travel planner üëå | It can't find any cities to Start | This is a wonderful, full featured travel planning app. It is making an extended trip so much easier for my whole family to keep track of. Thank you so much for creating this indispensable tool! I didn't need to pay for the subscription to make great use of this app, but I did (after finding the app so helpful while planning) for my own benefit, yes, but also in thanks to support the developers. I highly recommend this app. | Always a Pop-up window open, can't use it | I'm so glad this app exists. It's better than just writing down a list of places you want to go. However, sometimes when you type stuff in, the screen lags for a second. It's not terrible, but it's still pretty annoying | it was good for planning my trip and make a lists of places | Great concept and tells the user how long it takes to get to their next destination, but the app keeps crashing. I've lost a couple of places I've saved too. Good to start with but best to keep a personal copy with an excel sheet or something | it's very neat! perfect for planning any range of trips | this app is so helpful! everything is in one place. Flights, car rentals, hotels, and your itinerary! | Good concept and has some nice features. However, the UI is SO overcrowded with elements and information I actually got stressed at some point. Maybe squash the bottom side buttons into an expandable/collapsible menu? Hide the summary description for places to visit unless expanded? Shrink the date under the itinerary tab, why must it take 20% of an almost 7"" screen?? Overall nice app, but the UX does need some work to make it a bit more simplified. Too much information in too little space. | My initial review was regarding the frequent pop ups, however a member of the team has reached out and reassured me that things are still a work in progress. I really enjoy using the app, and it has saved me a lot of time compared to planning simply on Google maps. I can confidently say that I'll be replacing Google maps for Wanderlog as my trip planning app. | Not working, can't even specifically any country literally taking a lifetime to load. | ok this app is the best. I can travel smarter, cheaper, and have a better time. this is genius how designed and presented!! | *** I remember why I cancelled and deleted this app. Your FREE trial cost $60.00. In my book that ain't free. I realize that you need to get paid for your hard work, but FREE should be FREE! After the trial period, YOU could disable the account if I don't send you the $60.*** UPDATE- After figuring out I had a bad case intercranial rectumitis (I had my head up my a$$), Wanderlog probably is a very good app, it just wasn't what I need. And their customer service is really top-notch. Thanks | Such an amazing app. I'm usually the trip planner and it is so nice not to have it all in my head, email, written down and then I have to verbally tell others. It's so easy because it is all in 1 place and people can easily be on trips and see info. Like seeing flight info of other travelers is so helpful. It imports it all for everyone to see and you can easily plan out your entire days. The map feature is so nice too. I really can't compliment this app enough. | Little harder to use than the browser. GREAT trip planning app. Already got coworkers hooked on it! | This is a great app for organizing and planning a trip. | This is a really useful and well-done app. But the constant forced tutorials get really overbearing. You can't dismiss them or opt out, and even after using the app for a week I'm still getting them. I really like the app, but this is way too much. | Love the app! | Good but overpriced. I've planned several trips with it an even had a subscription. It's a really good tool, though at times laggy, but the price is just way too high for what you get out of it. | This app was a god send ... It's super easy to use. Planning an upcoming trip and this have mde organizing easy day a breeze and the ability to let others edit the agenda is great as well... The only downside is the Pro upgrade... I would love to access features in the Pro level but currently it's only an annual plan ... I don't need it for a year but would definitely get it for a month or 2. | Great app! | Nice app helps me see my vision in place | The tips are really effing annoying. Allow us to turn them off. | The app is great however, need a monthly subscription choice. I would happily pay for the couple if months I need it for, but not billed annually | well designed comparison of multiple review sites | super easy to navigate | The app worked fine till I signed up for the PRO and now everything is in French although it says English on the sign in. | I have just downloaded this app and so far it has been amazing. I love planning holidays and this just makes it so easy, when I see something online, a place or recommendation I just quickly add it to the app and it's there. I get directions, I get picture and what else is near. I can't give a review of how it works when I'm actually in Italy, but for now I'm finding it really really helpful to sort out where I'm going and the direction that my holiday is going to take. so far it's exciting | Is not actually free | used it for 5 vacations so far over the last 3 years. Love the money splitting capability and distance calculations. I forward all my booking emails and the app does the rest. Best way to collaborate with travel mates on vacation planning. | I used this app for a family trip with two teenagers. We were trying to get our teenagers to engage and help us plan some things to do on our vacation. It worked great! Love the shared functionality, the explore features, the map view, and the ease of adding links from Google. | I really enjoyed planning my trip to Lisbon. I found other tips from other travellers. It was easy to plan, I liked the fact I could see which sightseeing I should do in what order. I wish I could have the option to add t staurants as a separate tab. This might be added as plus option. Otherwise I look forward to planning my next trip | App is good with lots of organizational features, but is incredibly laggy and slow even with good internet connection. | The app is convenient & it includes many functions that are really helpful. Recommend to add in a function that helps us to record the travel fare (like by Grab/Taxi or Public Transport). | very helpful in planning stops and good suggestions | No access to app without paying first. | Good app but cost doesn't seem feasible. I only travel once a year -- two at most. There should be an option to choose payment per trip or per month. | amazing trip planner, we travel alot with family and I don't know what I would do without this app! | love it! makes it so easy to see my plans on the go and make changes to my itinerary as new things pop up | great wee app | Still takes lot of time to load the trip details even in the offline mode (with Pro subscription) Auto-fill day is a good feature but it should take the flight arrival and hotel check-in time into consideration while giving suggestions. There should be an option to choose the start and end time for siteseeing and auto-fill should suggest places based on the available time Budget tracking should have an option to add tripmates locally and not by email. Giving 3 stars as this has huge potential | Great info and options. | Super, super helpful app!! I have been googling sites & using separate apps looking for hotels to plan my family's multiday sight-seeing road trip. But nothing I found prior to Wanderlog had a map that helped track my noted locations, along with daily itenerary categories, places for my notations, and lits more. All of which really helps to organize & simplify the planning of our trip to/in each state & our traveling direction each day. Planning out an itinerary is SO much easier with Wanderlog | This app provides a convenient way to plan the itinerary. It provides a good overview of all the places of interest. | Claims to be a free app, but then insists on a credit card which will be charged after a 1 week trial. If it was worth the $70, I would pay it, but I'm not setting up an automatic charge before trying it. | I've used this app in the past and had nothing but a great experience. Definitely something I would recommend. If you're not the brightest crayon in the box, you might leave a negative review ü´°üòâ | Wanderlog allows a comprehensive scheduling experience. I'm able to add places to multiple lists then add each item to different days in the itinerary. I can invite my friends to the plan- & choose who can make changes. Also, when I add a place I can add the cost in any currency I desire, split that payment between whoever I need to, & the total is tallied in my native currency. I also like the ""explore"" option to get ideas for more activities in the area I'm visiting. | This app is great for travel and sharing your trip with those who are traveling with you. I love that the app links to youtube and tiktok, so I can watch videos of the place I am going to visit! | We started using Wanderlog this year, using the free version to plan a trip. We like having multiple users and the map option, which allows us to see how close all destinations are to each other. Today, I accidentally deleted our trip plan. I went to the help section and found that I could email support and they might be able to restore it. As it is Sunday, I didn't expect to hear from anyone, but got an email within hours from one of the app creators, and my trip was back! A++ service and app! | Terrible app. Tried to login on both web browser and mobile app and both FAILED. Website gave me an 503 error while loading the login screen, application doesnt even login. Ditch this app and choose another planner instead. | Just downloaded app to start planning after good reviews. Has uploaded hotel details from email forwarded but doesn't take flight details from same email. Won't let me tap on an airline or flight code when I try to input manually. Frustrated already! | This app makes it easier to plan and share live itinerary with family and friends. I use it to plan nearby activities which showed the distance which help to also plan our transport. And it syncs to Google Map so it is helpful to make last min changes and yet travel safely. Highly recommended travel planning app! | the best planner | great app for planning trips. I will use it for a long time. | This is a great travel planner app! Can't recommend it enough. | The versality of the app was fairly easy to maneuver. Activity suggestions were very helpful in planning the day events. | I'm enjoying all the tips on what to expect and where to visit. this app makes it easier to plan and you can get directions to each place within the app. very convenient . thank you! | I just got this app and I'm already frustrated. I can't add transport between places (like Uber from airport to hotel) I can't add an activity without adding a place but when you add a place it shows all sorts of other information I don't want to see. I don't want recommendations. I don't want pictures. I don't need the web description showing. When I'm done adding places to the itinerary, I want the ""add a place"" field to go away. It could be great but UI is not efficient or customizable | Can't even try without card first no thanks | I found this to be a very useful app for itinerary planning. One feature I would tweak is to have the ability to numerically place a new item into the itinerary rather than having it added to the end and then have to reorder it. Other than that minor issue, it is a great app! | I was able to plan and map out my entire trip. It was a great resource to have! | I am a frequent traveler and travel with big groups 2-3 times a year. This app is EVERYTHING! Makes planning so easy with other people as well. I love it üòÄ | lots of tools but still east to use. | Amazing app to plan any trip | Not what I was looking for. This app is too busy | I used the free version for my trip and would say that it reduced alot of unnecessary stress for me to navigate around. The best thing is that it shows the distance and travelling time making it easier to plan our routes without dropping pins on Google map. There's also recommendations of places to visit. Will continue to use this app for more upcoming trips. | wonderful app. it meets all my needs. | great app! | No description on how to use | very helpful app so far. its helped organize my trip, personal and business. good job! | I love how organised this app makes your trip! it keeps all together, from your flight dates and booking nos to where to go next with accommodation reservation nos and addresses. Well worth the money!! | fantastic | absolutely not worth the money. | update sugggestion : great app as always! can you add widget for quick add for expense and quick check in to the current location if possible? **************************** after so long i finally found an app that is how i would want it to be, tho alot of feature r still tba but the core feature are there, thank you for making this! | As a first time user of this app, I can honestly say, that it was super easy-to-use. I've already started spreading the word. It took me a bit to find this app, and so happy that I did. I used to use another app, that is no longer available, a few years back. It's especially helpful with the budgeting feature, when you are splitting costs with others, and knowing who owes $$ to who. I will be using the app for all my trips and will probably upgrade to the Pro version. | Best way to plan a self guided tour! My sister and I took a trip to Ireland, rented a car, and planned the whole adventure with this app. Great suggestions, loads of photos, map features, route optimizing. Excellent! | I'm really enjoying the visual organization offered, I have such a difficult time planning huge trips like this. thanks again because I'm enjoying the process this time. | Enjoyed this app, I was able to invite my travel friend to it and we could plan at the same time. The pre-populated packing lists gave helpful reminders! | Most efficient travel app. Worth the money | By far the best trip planner app I've come across. However, there might be a memory leak issue as the app gets slower and slower with more time spent on the itinerary. The app has been lagging a lot lately. Especially in the map mode. Been using this app for a year, still hasn't been fixed. | This is wonderful apps. It help to plan by yourself or collaborate with others. It also can book through hotel and entrance ticket from the apps. Is one stop solution for travellers... It also record our budget and expenses. It can share to people also. | awesome app. I love it. it connects to emails maps and many more. perfect. | Tried the trial pro version, it couldn't do the first most basic thing what I wanted (import an image of a map...!) - it suggested I save it to a cloud based storage then save the link to that in Wanderlog - seems counter intuitive to me. I have gone back to just using drive and saving all my info in a folder there. Wanderlog not so wonderful after all. | Nice try but WAY too cluttered and complicated, I might as well keep to my current workflow, Google Docs and Google Maps.... no time to spend learning such an information overload. | I loved using this app in planning a recent trip to Italy. I was easily able to import all my reservations and bookings, move itinerary items around, track expenses, and share my plans with co-travelers and family. I really loved the little tips and suggestions, and the option to have the app map my day for travel efficiency. I used to do all this on a spreadsheet and will be using wanderlog going forward | usefull | Great app to keep everything in one place and collaborate with trip-mates | Very helpful in planning our Tokyo trip. | love it!! | It's an excellent tool for travellers, even better from the ones who are not traveling alone. You can share everything with your travel partner (S) and plan together. I really love this app. | Perfect for planning an overseas trip with friends! I love that multiple travelers can collaborate and add to the trip planning. | helpful for our first trip!! the app isneasy to use and navigate | Everything in one app (car rentals, hotels, maps, even AI), you may like it or not. For me it's too difficult to digest (I tried a few times). But when I saw ""your trip is too long"" I finally gave up... | I took a family trip to Portugal, spending 3 days in Porto and 3 in Lisbon (actually here now). The Wanderlog app helped us map out and time our plan so we were able to maximize the sights we saw and work in stops for food and shopping. Highly recommend using this app for all vacations! | The app made traveling around Taipei via public transport a breeze. Won't hesitate to use it again on my next trip. Planning for the trip was also a fun and easy experience. Would not mind paying for per use instead of monthly subscription since I only travel 1-2 times a year. | Works exactly how you expect it to | Wanderlog helped the three of us collaboratively plan our trip and it kept track of our budgeting. It was a great resource to allow groups to track what they are doing each day of the trip. We used it constantly. | feel good to use. will be better if it is easier to edit. | I have planned many trips with Wanderlog. Love it :) | Great app. Easy to use, informative, is a great planner overly. the free version still has a ton of functions to make it perfectly usable. | Very useful app | AMAZING App. This organizes all your travel needs in 1 place, no more looking through multiple apps to find hotel info, flight info, notes. I have the free version and Love it! | I'm using the free version and love it! It's a really easy to use app. Very customisable for each trip with different folders, daily itinerary, and recommendation blogs. You can see all saved places on a map to allow for itinerary planning. Can't recommend enough. | Misleading cost of pro version - I was charged for a full year instead of the monthly cost shown. Not cool. I just wanted to try the pro version for a month before deciding wether or not this would be helpful for my trip. | I like how easy it is to use as it syncs the places I want to go directly into the app! :) hoping to have a timetable tab where I could see everything I've planned though. | This is a great way to sync up your travel party! | This app really makes it easy to plan out a trip, find options for activities or places to visit, select a restaurant, etc. And it's really amazing that the free version will allow you to email your hotel, car rental, and flight reservations to your trip and then automatically fill in the details. It's also nice to be able to share the trip plan with others (either trip mates, or just family and friends so that they know where you'll be). | Must pay | Amazing travel planning app. Super easy to navigate and collaborate with fellow travelers. Win-win for both type A and go with the flow travelers. Thanks! üôåüèΩ | Great for planning trips | Really easy to use, and has plenty ways and spaces to keep your itinerary organized! since there is so much information, the screen can be a bit cluttered at times. Still the best trip planning app I have used. | Do not sign up for free trial!! It's not free. They will charge you anyway! And Google play won't refund or intervene to force them to abide by the ""free"" trial. | Great app, I love the map feature in particular and how easily it can pull information about booking from emails. | Very helpful for getting around places you don't know if you're willing to put in the effort ahead of time. Used it for NYC and just checked what map pins I was close to for what I needed. Had a food list, a picture spot list, and so on. How the itenrary is set up needs a little work but it's still pretty good. | The best travel itenerary builder I've ever used, hands down | Amazing app!! We're using the free version so far, and we're very pleased! The map and the explorer sections are super helpful!! | great trip planning app!!! | There's way too much going on in this app. Tripit is much more user friendly and clean","{""1"":0,""2"":0,""3"":240,""4"":721,""5"":12506}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†49.99 - CZK¬†2,199.99 if billed through Play","8.0","8.0","VARY","Wanderlog","Wanderlog","support@wanderlog.com","https://wanderlog.com",,"https://wanderlog.com/privacy","Wanderlog","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UPCPofy2GzRCOSvrJh1Vf03KJ-yoZlzPn9F8X3wmZ3Q8Ja2cFSgMVTW9RzISEKLJ9us","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zw-QaVlEkLAdX77kgmoIbIZJCrZO3AEuzG998pehnsGBLiwluHMaej5UEgyVnvRquP4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s4ov2KdTRKPFNmW8uqzvS9aHB2hAg93KzUEL2rJ1blL1Sdgli6OzouOIn_0fH8N2yiw9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hv0ww5ird-jcav8NYs9G4U7g9vfShOGH_V0qvplERqNIlapGqO2wvnMYtUf8Bl4Byg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SfJKx8Xp1VEHUxOkNDTFBsY7F1ROEsCJ5PM683e5NRdvaFWpKTxnhOTXQ9RTW2IgVPU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bHi0phpXB0Gv8S8dfDRPUJcAdj5yKa1Vr3m4Y3C2kIagGmKMydHiRBFHmXr2rNYOVS84"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mHJtRJgsG3ti-BJltQ2zoTOn0GUaRCC9bfYY4fCr8hfKShLH3VfE4QXy2F0465hubePU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0lybPwdP2xX6zvxFhgwJ-qq40Ycgpi0Yu5IIkQXijt0d0G91vizFsJAQgxRSzugXHw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TCTXPzxqld4owbTWUDybBVUWSXmNmFmKOFViubFKC-Eo5I6u-8AzE40oXcsIHjO0LcI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FUqSOBXt2XMMt-DjCX-2Fw9JEiCiLDdd0Qe9kY4ljczevM01v5OrvsuFlr4Lg-uoOHBK""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Aug 21, 2019",1711057029000,"2.122","Wanderlog is more reliable: we fixed various small issues, and also launched the Dream Trip Contest for a chance to win a $1,000 trip to anywhere in the world!

How it works
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 30,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we‚Äôre able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don‚Äôt have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.

I'm a casual user using free mode, but I like it. | Very good tracking | Awful privacy practices. | For the person sitting at their bay window, anywhere within 20 miles of a large airport, this is a great tool for satisfying one's curiosity about where these planes come from and, well, everything about them. Great for an old person who just sits a lot! | Great app üëå | Very useful and reliable | Um, I think the Flightradar24 is the perfect radar I've ever finded, it has an free 3D models with 3 sessions, but it has a lot of ads on this flight radar, so I just rates it 4 stars. | As an avgeek this is amazing. | Use this app litterally all the time highly recommend | Love the app, it is very accurate.

I also love the ability to look at the top 10 tracked aircraft in the world live. It would be a clear 5 stars from me if it had not been for the vast amount of functions disabled if you don't pay per month. This is disappointing Use ADS-B unfiltered flight tracker"",""I find the app easy enough to navigate by flight number, or airline, departing and arriving. A useful feature was being able to point at the horizon and see which flight it was that was passing us. I like being able to track helicopters, and medical flights as well, (when they declare their plans). It's clear to read and there is plenty of information to see for free. Most of my family use this app."",""It's the best app I have ever used. It tells more information about the plane you are tracking. I would recommend every plane spotter to use this app. It helps me a lot when I want to see a plane. It also gives airport information. Like Arrivals, departures, on ground, basic information, disruption rate and many more information. I am pleased with this app."",""Excellent app all around! Some ideas that would be awesome - give an option to display callsigns above each aircraft in map view, like you see when viewing an aircraft in 3D mode, another great feature would be more diverse aircraft models for map view, it seems you are working on this as there're different images for a lot of different aircraft, but would be cool to do more, can I help?

An hostel listed on their APP stole 120,10‚Ç¨ from me 4 months ago. I've talked with 4 different customer service representatives without any proper help. Horrific. Never use their services. Book everywhere else, not with Hostelworld. | Easily the best App to find a place to stay anywhere. Love it!! | To select birthday, need to scroll 120 times for ten years of my life. Then times that by 7 !! And it can't recognize by bank card | best price | The app in itself is good, but the performance and interface is terrible. It crashes all the time, and I cannot log in to my account, even though in the website I have already logged in to make a reservation. | Non-functional in almost every way. Crashes constantly, wipes anything you have typed if you put it in the background, brings up wrong cities, brings up blank pages after typing in a specific city, functions at half the speed of the browser version. Pretty much pointless to have on your phone. | Fabulous | So many memories | It requires international transaction | I feel cheated. No taxes included, and then you get slapped with a higher price than expected. Not happy at all. | great location, near Union station. most all stuff is walkable nice clean joint, big / lots of rooms. accommodating & friendly staff. | Great | Money deducted and booking done in sold out hostel and cancellation done just before arrival. Pathetic portal and service | Great place to find the perfect accommodation for your destination and needs at nice low rates. | I want to remove my pre-filled in credit card details but it is not possible, please fix this to make the app more secure | Rko | HostelWorld sells overbooked hostels that are sold out and than doesn't even respond back to return the money. The 'Booking' app has always emailed me back immediately. HostelWorld also does not care if their vendors constantly charge more for their rooms despite it being priced differently on their app. 1 star for stealing peoples money and not emailing back on MULIPLE occasions. | The idea behind the app is good, the implementation is decent. Looks like a MVP generated by a small startup, has minimal functionalities, can't put payment details from the app, no customer support, no information about payments | they don't publish honest reviews when terrible experiences are had by clients. They also don't do anything about the bad experiences and don't hold their hostels accountable. | Good üòÉ | A hostelworld error caused me to lose money. The response from the customer service was as if its my fault and they made out that I should be greatful for a small amount of the money I lost, back. I responded and have not received a response back. Really bad from hostelworld, makes me not want to book through them again. I lost two nights worth of money and it ruins my travel plans as I have to stay here now because of being charged twice. Wouldn't refund 1 night to stop me being charged twice. | great way to find nice hostels in Japan. haven't tried it elsewhere yet. | Great choice | just joined. so far so good | Unable to view any previous trips, leave reviews or use the chat function. Disappointed. | great value ! nice people | Don't recommend | Very creative mind to let people socialize. very innovative thinking, should bring more similar initiatives. Good job | Easy to use | Works well. I can quickly book a night on the spot around. Great value for a backpack trip in Japan. | Nice but seems more expensive than Booking, also no fidelity program ! | No use (don't know if it's temporary issue/permanant one). App is not able to book hostels in Iran. | works fast, plenty of options. I still don't try the customer service. | That is perfectly | A very easy way to book a hostel and have some recommendations | European university of germany location | this is scam app . I booked through it and they took 10$ and gave me confirmation however I contacted the owner he informed me that there is no confirmation and not available and he told me I have to book through other websites! scamm scammmm scamm ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | Favorite app for hostels for sure. Love the Hostelworld fam! | the best deals ever!!! love it | It's ok and provides a decent amount of hostels. However, when I try to give a review I am getting an error and cannot submit it. So, I would not trust the reviews. Check trip advisor or other platforms before booking. Or use a different one altogether | one of the best app that help me when i travel and they have amazing stuff | Great app! | they lay out things very easy and the app is highly efficient and intuitive with easy ways to change currency and so on. usually find the best prices here too :) | Can't favourite hostels? Hostels appear in an order (paid for?) | One of the kind it is a perfect app | so excited | The app is easy to use and all the info I need is provided. plus, I love the convenience to cancel our change dates if necessary. | I always had nice experience in these hostels!! | efficient booking system | horrible | I used this app a lot, but now they run so many annoying ads on YouTube I decided to use competition instead. | 5-‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Five Stars | good but annoying I keep getting adverts to use Hostelworld when I already use it lol. algo is messed up | Great information | I've traveled around the world for years, and this app has been absolutely necessary | very useful | App for hostel lovers and travellers | great | Tuve que cancelar una reservaci√≥n a causa de la cancelaci√≥n de un vuelo y no me devolvieron el dep√≥sito que hab√≠a ya pagado con mi tarjeta de cr√©dito a hostelworld... Muy mal que al cancelar la reserva no reembolsen el dinero.... | No longer worth getting a hostel when they cost as much or more than a hotel. Plus more are moving to piece meal microtransactions which ruin the experience. | good | the site keeps having problems with credit card payments. seems like something you'd want to fix | easy to use plus so many options & information | I decided to delete app after downloading but the deletion process is really long and not friendly at all. There is no need to do it such long, please don't play with people's nerves and accounts/data. Thanks. | Excellent app for booking hostels. | Very nice application for hostels | love it! convenient and easy | Cool and easy app to use, but customer support is very shifty, you can't call them and have to go trough a long procedure to finally kinda get in contact and have to wait 10 hours for a response. In my case that was terrible, I accidentally booked twice because I didn't receive any confirmation the first time and the second time was the day of planned arrival in the hostel, if there was a warning or something, hey you already booked or hey, you wouldn't be able to cancel, but no nothing. | Godsend for solo travellers | easy to use and intuitive | By far the best app for booking hostels while travelling/backpacking. literally a must-download if you travel. | No longer able to see Linkups without booking the specific hostel. Being able to see linkups was a very useful feature to decide which hostel to book. | Fake app. I made a reservation but on reaching the hotel they said they were not even aware of an app/site called Hostelworld. I paid an amount for pre booking and there is ZERO customer support. Looters. | Thank you very much and useful ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞ | I've used hostel world 4 times this year.the app is easy to use I've never had any problems with hostel world . until COVID they took 2 years to give me my deposit back. | always my best choice with hostelworld | Booked a hostel that wasn't even available, but it still showed up on hostelworld. I was turned away at checkin, but this company kept my deposit and refused to refund me | so far so good | This app looks very pretty on the surface, but it can't even find most of the US cities (large and small) that I enter into the destination box. It would be a very good idea to work on this issue if you want anyone to use it! | Great app that makes searching and booking easier! It also allows you to meet with other people in chats beforehand. I absolutely love this app and use it whenever I solo travel. Heck, some of these places, I'd even have a friend book their own stay with me! So worth it for socialization. You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you! | Easy and fast. | great app :) | Been using this app and website forever. It's never let me down. | Generally works fine,the discounts for the hostels seem quite good. Would be better if this could work offline just in case I don't have an internet. I'm happy with the app, allows me to go places I couldn't afford otherwise, especially in expensive cities like Dublin and London. Also only some hotels can be paid partly by card and the rest by cash on the spot. | Bad experience with no support I paid the advance of the booking for you The rest of the payment didnt want to proceed and its not my fault No support from you or from the hostel neither Anyway it was just an advance of 25‚Ç¨ but believe me you lost a client I dont recommend this app | Efficient and reliable - typically has cheaper pricing than I can find elsewhere | good app for Booking premium hostels | Hostelworld does not care about the safety of travelers at all. As long as they get money, they do not care if the hostel is safe or responsive. | Best App | Have found so many great hostels thru this app! The reviews are usually quite trustworthy | They don't help you if you cancel a reservation because you discover the hostel is lying on pictures | No CT locations | App didn't work. I tried to log in with 3 different browsers, but it just keeps hanging instead of logging me in. Total waste of my time. | worst service. They took my booking. when I reached hotel. hotel cancelled booking and denied room. In this situation Hostel world customer care did not respond to my mails or call. they took payment in dollors. My money also not refunded | weee | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Great app for finding affordable places to stay around the world. My go to as a budget traveler. | Unusable. Installed app to try out the chat/social features, since to book I just use website. After the log in screen it sits loading forever. | Easy :) | Absolutely unreliable. I make a hostel reservation, I am charged the pre-payment from my bank account, and then I am informed by the hostel (not Hostelworld) that my booking with them is not valid. I contact Hostelworld's customer care and ask why my booking apparently has been cancelled. I receive NO reply or explanation, only an automated e-mail saying my Hostelworld booking has been cancelled. Nothing about the fact that I should get my ‚Ç¨20.09 pre-payment back! I am massively disappointed. | simple, very easy to use. quick way to book | easy to use | perfect | Great experience ... | I love it. | Ok | ok | great services | It's a world wide party, lots of ladys | it works | doesnt remember date selected | Lame gukuss | Site etc is fine. But app missing features. You can't see distance by current location. You can't hide female only rooms. Basic things for travellers | My favorite Hostel booking app! | I went last year the location was amazing amazing the staff they are super nice and the breakfast was so yummy that's why I booked again this year | very good apps | IT didn'tüö´seem to like my credit cardsüëéüèª‚ÄºÔ∏è | Booking Cancelled without intimation. We had to again look for different Hotels for stay. | excelente | Lost nearly $300 because Hostelworld refuses to take responsibility for the hostels they support. I've complained several times about a particular hostel (because my experience was awful), and they have done absolutely nothing about it. That hostel is still listed. I used to love the Hostelworld platform, but I think I will make the effort to contact hostels directly now instead. Also, the Share Your Trip feature hasn't worked for the last several stays. | Please update your app it's unable to fatch my location nither able to search any place. Useless aap. | I have found multiple amazing hostels through here and highly recommend this app. | wonderful üòòüòä | I'm unable to view my past bookings | Searching for locations doesn't work | Thank you the ease of an experience to book my reservation online (Theough the app). | Horrible App. Pricey. Plus they lie offering 75% discount. | This is one of the most user friendly hotel booking app I have ever used. Pretty budget friendly booking too. | wow the best app | good app | Good site but dependant on price from other sites + or -. I don't know why when it's a hostel site it has expensive hotels and some hostels above other site prices!? | muy Bien | great app to book | Pretty good, seems cheaper than others? | incredible app, works around the world | Broken app and website. The production URL for logging in seems failing everywhere. Unable to login during crucial time during VISA process | Everything is easy and flawless | great plate-forme | tight af | Does not work as expected. Uninstalling, moving on. | easy to use and love the layout/aesthetic! | grate app. .you get tips and honest feed back from people who where actually there. not the company painting a facility that's probably not honest about the .accommodation. don't get me wrong some people give bad reviews on some stuff. that's its kinda pity. but this app helps a ton.! I been using it for years! cheers and safe travels. | easy to use. reviews are very informative. respects privacy by not sending spam email. | Nice Application | It's Nice. | easy | Very good app | does not list all available properties in the area | Plenty of options for accomodation. üòÉ","{""1"":1864,""2"":372,""3"":2237,""4"":6340,""5"":38413}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Hostelworld.com","Hostelworld.com","mobilesupport@hostelworld.com","http://www.hostelworld.com","One Central Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland","http://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php","Hostelworld.com","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eJ2engLkD5uSTQohucDnGP0U6Q8A7LWOb436BgmPbLtzTvpvcmwGTUXknViF6-z94P4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Tm7Bu-0_DA-TYt9spu37T0Ktcdij6IhYNQ-1KrWzLb5J7di0gzt6shOy9VrKhSw8YMQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AmNqnEdos-P5YB_3mF943us8Y2Z78AA-wWfgiIovPjT-AzleYFOEJtNz26asvhCjMG4O"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3aemDAV08xpTP4LJeuS4BSDTqn-0X9IsuK6sZciI_cULvg3ZxQ9_INSHRMV45ZZpyw4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PHgi1onTa7qWi1LnG1SvuepeaTNwLu0PtZYc-1Rs1mUerc7WNYlRakukJDGKv96fjA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lTC47o0hzViIFZHQ8F8-gapGi8vrD3_U5aMytnjHdzfgnG8Hufjin61vdOOdAXr55FA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/68sx4O10iet_O3OUXGN3hcWwbSu3CJ7vK29XCTbk-0ayxnVJlrscjD6pfCXyesyEdkI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7KcChubnrhmcxw2xwgsBBtll-jIEpQST7lRgn8dk3n0Ac3ujjEyFAiTGmdzGdyiSZYw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yl5S6HQ7SBuz_igJyo60e2BxEpe-Sn8Uwb43nUm_X570kwMJY2u3I0SakGZhXVbExsZM""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"May 24, 2011",1711366916000,"9.49.0","We‚Äôve been working on improvements so that you can have a better user experience while using Hostelworld‚Äôs App!

The new feature that allows you to set when the day starts for touring is a welcome capability. I've used this in multiple cities around the world. | Wow, downloaded for our upcoming trip to Oslo and the first thing on all the itineraries is the Viking Ship Museum. Seriously, it's closed UNTIL 2026. That's part of the reason I was looking for an app with suggestions. The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City‚Ñ¢ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan. Even after deleting the whole itenary it doesnt refresh the updated itenary. Very bad app experience. Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Jobüëç | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing üòç | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | t·ªët | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for. | This app/company will add your email address to spam lists with no authorization, so don't use any of the SSO options when you launch it! How trashy. Don't start emailing me your newsletter just because I opened your app one time. | good experience in yelanaka oon bikes the feedback related vehicle are good, the way of approch towards the costumer was brilliant , the vehicle are well maintained with proper fueling in the bike that I have took overall experience was good | Creating new plans and editing existing ones could be easier, but it offers a wonderful service | Really great app for planning a visit somewhere. So many options!!! I just wish I could connect my trip accounts (hotels, flights, etc) for points and discounts. Also, it would be nice to see AAA or military discounts. Excellent app and I'm excited for this application's future! | was this a joke | I can not use the app, appear google notifc. Of loc. And I cant use | Love the website. But the App is not working. Android 12. Just white screen when I open it. | Deeply unimpressed. I had already put together my itinerary of Amsterdam and very few of the places were listed and some were in the wrong place. | ok so far | Happy so far even the app looks like iOS. Probably Flutter tech. I will do 5 stars if I can manage to mark as visited the attractions. | Permission hogger. If I say no to the location permission, it means no. Spamming it, will not change my mind. | Nice app, very easy to create an itinerary and to find great places to visit. Needs some improvement when changing the day within an itinerary. | All the app can give you is paid places tours. Nothing like real travel plans. | For your day tours, couldn't you include (or at least have it as option) a STOP FOR LUNCH??!!....then resuming the tour in the afternoon?? | nice app to use when planning a trip. They show a diverse assortment of activities in each city. I especially like that they have trip planning by day and desired level of activity. 1, 2 or 3 days plans. | Doesn't even work on my new tablet but good on PC or phone! | Great trip planner for international travelers. | Such an amazing tool, don't leave home without it! | Excellent tool for travel | I've used in 10+ cities and it's great for planning day-to-day activities and staying organized, and also finding things to do on the fly. It's really helpful that you can add other plans, like visiting friends, theatre tickets, etc. and find things to do based on your location so they're easy to walk to. My only complaint is when creating plans from a wishlist, it prioritizes location over operating hours - what's the point of getting somewhere efficiently if it's closed when you get there? | perfect app to plan your own tour or get private tours. Very helpful. | Location permission Pop up never goes away. That's so enoying. | All my plans disappeared after opening on the web | Not impressed by this app at all. I was expecting to be able to add sites in the cities I am visiting so I could plan the best route to see everything. Unfortunately, everything in this app was geared toward booking tours. I understand that they need to make money and, if you are looking to book a bunch of tours I'm sure this is great, but this is not what I was looking for. Huge disappointment. | Nice | Formerly useful app. This app allows you to plan a multi-day itinerary in some detail. You can take one of their plans and move attractions around to suit. Just a few small improvements would help: 1) Ten day trip maximum is too short 2) Should allow a fixed time for reservations 3) Should be able to change hotels to allow a multi-city trip UPDATE 2022-08 Sorry to say app and Web now useless as some recent reviews have noted. Zero stars | very helpful app for making effective use of your time in a city | Very helpful app, but a number of glitches and needed features make it a 3 star rating. | Just an app selling overpriced tours. Better to do a little research by your self. | Great app | Great idea - shockingly poor execution It's like first draft. Changes times & days in my plan. Unable to move them back. Can't add ANYTHING that's not on their list. Forced to have events one after another, as if I'm not allowed a break. Very frustrating & unnecessary | Music tour | Great idea, really helpful but UI is not intuitive at all! It's frustrating to use as I can quite add 1 day guides per day, but then it's over writing them. Just really confusing! | it's a good app | Keeps freezing | Exceptional. I downloaded map and managed to use it in offline mode. No need to ask others how to reach places. | I was really enjoying the app, I'm going on a trip in 2 weeks and it really helped me to organise things, I paid for tickets through the app and the money has left my bank and now the app has crashed. What do I do? | the app won't open... otherwise I love the app. please fix it | not working, exactly when i need it, with locally dowloaded data, every page is an error page | Please check after new update..the app is not working...I tried reinstalling many times but no luck...could you help me with that.. | Worthless now that it only works for booking tours | top app, incredibly useful. highly recommended | design your itinerary like a pro | Nice apps | brilliant app. | I used this app all over Italy. it's great! | Great idea! | Expensive and limited activities. Sometimes there are only 6 activities even though the place has more to offer. Other apps are better. | Excellent travel tool! | Tried using the app to plan a trip to Malta. The only plans it comes up with is for Valetta. Pretty disappointed. | nice app | Well organized and friendly app | My guide wherever I go. Use it to plan in advance for my trips and get the best deals | Excellent app. A must use when visiting a city that you don't know. Great descriptions of attractions and sites to visit. I love that it breaks out places to visit in itineraries. I highly recommend using it. | Super useful | A Nice idea: needs work especially coding? app struggles, however its a nice effort with potential. Would like to edit wishlist to make notes on selections? Website doesn't let you login with G suspect more programming issues. | Amazing! | Good app with lots of fun stuff to explore. Lovely to just browse info about different cities | Fantastic app for making city visiting plans. You can make your planning consistently, based on abundante information from the app itself, and then use it later in a real life travel situation. | perfect app | app is good, but needs equal functionality to web page. Also adding places & hotels does not work by name search anymore. you must enter addresses, this was a great feature to add your hotel or your place by name | Can I get all information regarding local town of India.... | perfect | Was very easy to plan my trip to Southern Spain using this app. Will use in future travels for sure. | Very good for making plans for travel/trips, except that it won't recognize the current address and reshuffle things accordingly. | Best app for planning a trip in other cities, highly recommeded | the best tool for planning a great trip | Only suggests services and tours that you can get for free or much less money. Totally pointless if you want to explore the real city. | Tried to enter my hotel and it can't find it but no option to manually add. | Does not work on Chromebook | whata dream to see that with your own eyes.... some day i will | visit a city makes my trip much easier thanks. | Not sufficient | you are welcome back | have hee | So it would be perfect if I could add all the things we added to our wishlist. Unless you buy tickets to certain things through them you can't add them to your day. So weird. | My go to app for travelling, it saves all the work of planning what to visit, in which order and ticket prices. I love it and I have recommended it to all my friends. | really informative. | The easiest app you can use for planning your trips. Very convenient with the exact time it takes to reach a place. Highly recommended! | good app | very helpfull and very information üëçüèºüëçüèº | Full of information, handy tool for travelers. | Best app ever! | Great Vacation itinerary App! | long hajj j job hhjv hn knock b hajj GMV Jehovah NC hajj n bbjcjc kg bob hajj h juju h:2 v he.h hn dgdhv ,g | Amazing | great app, use it on every holiday. its great for creating an itinerary and being able to discover all the sights and how to organise what's close to one another etc. only reason for 4 stars is that the travel times between destinations is always wrong, | I just live this app... As a full-time solo traveller I 24/7 keep travelling to new cities.. It's been a long time I'm using this app to plan my trips... I recommend this to everyone who loves to travel... This super easy to use... Thanks for creating this app... It is so useful. | I use this app before going on vacation to a new location. it's gives a great overview of attractions. | Horrible | I always use this app when planning a trip. It helps me find interesting places to visit. | All it is is ads for tour companies | Kept getting a mistake notification | Great app but it keeps reseting when I switch between apps. | Helpful, maps and ""minutes from"" attractions are great features. | Good app | Best app that I have used for past two years in Europe and the US. | Beautiful places on a beautiful app | ü•∞ Love it An app with the reality. | Very useful for planning and organizing your visit. It is a very good tool for covering all aspects of the trip. Excellent, every body should use it when traveling. | I downloaded this game seeing the pictures above.But when opened the game it was written visitacity but not opening.I tried to open for 10 minutes but it didn't open. | My must have tour planner | Amazing | An Experience Beyond Description... | I have used this app a few times now and it is really useful.

My experience has been incredible, the moments they weren't I looked for help and had a fast response and support from the WP experience team!! I believe the increase in packers using the app has decreased the fast response, acceptance and care with communication from the hosts (I noticed personally and empirically from others packers). My only tip: give courses/certificates to hosts too. THANK YOU!üíô | a bit too expensive | Quick and easy to use | Fake app. Scam. Don't use it. A woman lied to me and did not show to pick me up. Nobody at the place new her. Her name is Ruby from La Belle Eco France. I hope she goes to hell. | Thanks you | Great app to travel around the world | Awesome | Perfect way to travel on a budget and meet awesome people along the way! | I bought a full year subscription. I stayed with one host approved by Worldpackers. The listing said I would have a private room, but when I got there he was expecting me to stay in the same room he was sleeping in (I was 19 at the time, and I am a girl). He also had a dog (not mentioned) who chewed up my boot. I contacted Worldpackers for a refund as I no longer trusted how they evaluate hosts and they refused to to give one. I would he very wary of signing up for this, especially for a year. | Hasta ahora un √©xito, | Excellent! | I recommend World Packers , it is my first experience with them , so far so good. They are really serious , there are training, advice, courses ..it is great | Super easy to use! | It's a great opportunitty to meet new people | Bit tricky to put all the information and for apply to volunteering.. I mean many questions to answer but in works really well! | Everything is so easy and convenient, straightforward app with an incredible purpose behind!! | Start | This is best for world tourüòçü§© | definitely better than the other worktrade websites.

Because still now i didn't meet anyone through this app? Please let me how to full it? | Worldpackers is great. The information is clear. It's serious about the reviews and volunteers | Es de paga para poder participar. Obvio que no se paga por crear una cuenta üôÑ, pero eso de lo que hablas est√° escondido detr√°s del muro de pago, lo que no es nada barato, aparte que uno va a ir de ""voluntario"" as√≠ que desde un inicio la aplicaci√≥n gana y gana m√°s cuando ya la persona trabaja para esas empresas. Ustedes ganan un mont√≥n de plata a costa de voluntarios y cobrar toda esa cantidad es absurdo. | Love. It. One very small bug though- sometimes when asked if we're flexible with the dates, it takes 10-15 tries for it to accept my response. It just shuts down and doesnt let me reply, says, ""oops, something went wrong"" or ""couldn't complete your request"", which is very annoying because it causes delay in responding to offers and might end up in losing that opportunity.

I hardly recommend this app! | This app is so friendly and all that gives us is amazing | Great for international travelers! God bless you. | √â simples de usar. √â muito intuitivo. Eu poderia sugerir que houvesse uma esp√©cie de rede social dentro do app para que os volunt√°rios pudessem formar uma esp√©cie de rede dentro do app. | Awesome concept and can't wait to go on a trip! Unfortunately the app itself really needs work. Dates for example will show as available but only because a few days (or none) are unbooked out of an entire month. Mostly the search function/filters needs to be revamped. There's no option to search keywords based on region forcing you to scroll endlessly till you find what's right. It's just difficult in general to really narrow your search properly | Very great experience with world packers. I already found a place to stay!!!! The difference between the website and the app are that I couldn't find the inbox on the website(for some reason) but I could in the app. If you find some difficulties, I would try it in the app, then in the website, and if both don't work, then I would ask support for help. I hope that helps you! | Muito positivo | Very nice way to travel, volunteer, and meet people üòÄ highly recommended | Great | Great App!!! | Really nice app for volunteers | Very nice app and good platform, translation in app is needed | I don't know much about the app. I still just tried to volunteer one place.

But looks like map is not accurate. | Amazing üòç | App is very intuitive and the platform looks interesting. However it's missing a filter for searching for animal welfare, animal shelters and hosts willing to collaborate with volunteers that travel with pets. At the moment the app just doesn't make it convenient for me to pinpoint the hosts matching my search criteria. Other than that great üëç | Some account are fake and I also not get proper response from any host And when I asked the team to refund my money back, they are saying that you are not fit for our refund policy.so don't pay any money | Can't sign up Captcha problem | Nice app | Well I'm not happy with fee structure, even paying in app there's some listing which asks for money than what's the point of volunteering | Hello Am from Tanzania I have met a traveler from Netherland volunteering some where. the one who instructed me to find this app as the best way to find any one to volunteer here to our working place. But I don't know what procedures to follow to get people to host them | Its a very good app if you want to travel the world and volunteer as well and have amazing experiences.

No messages, just BS alerts from this app. I'm uninstalling. | Very nice app, for my trips! | The app doesn't let me put on a profile pic, even though i gave permission and i can upload my travell pictures and videos, for some reason the app acts as if i didn't allow it to enter my camera roll when i want to upload a profile pic, and if i don't a have a profile pic it's very unlikely to be accepted or trusted by a host. | The app does nothing but glitch. I can't look at any listings. | I just downloaded the app and everytime I try to select an opportunity to look at it... I can't. I select it and it loads for a second and immediately takes me back to the search page. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, along with restarting my phone to see if it would help...

I've been waiting for customer service's reply for over a month; all they do is ignore my emails. Try other legitimate, fair and FREE platforms like Workaway. P.S.: I'm not advertising Workaway, just pointing how awful this platform is.

I want my money back | Very easy to use and good experience | Worldpacking is a community experience, and the app surely keeps things transparent. | Worth the price | Guys, please save your money, this ""program"" it's clearly dedicated only for females, most of the hosts only accept females and if you are ""lucky"" enough to find a place, trust me the females from the place will make you a living hell there... | It's genius | Only for traveler. | horrible! never ever trust this app..they charge money and once they accept they will send you fake destinations... my experience was horrendous.. the host didn't provided anything after accepting my application... these guys don't reply to you emails.. never ever use this app ..they are bunch of thugs... Don't trust what you see on the page and pls ensure that you have some other place to stay in case these crooks cheat you too | I can't find my account. When I trying to login it's says ""email already taken"". When i trying to recover my password it's says ""user not found"". So, this is trash for me. Playstore should remove this junk. | Ÿäÿ®Ÿä ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÉ ÿ®ŸÅŸÑŸàÿ≥ | very good | EN.: Worldpackers is an excellent way to travel and exchange experiences with people from all over the world. Furthermore, it is a complete transformation of yourself. PT-BR: Worldpackers √© uma excelente forma de viajar e trocar experi√™ncias com pessoas de v√°rios lugares do mundo. Al√©m disso, √© uma transforma√ß√£o completa de voc√™ mesmo. | Com certeza eu recomendo! Melhor plataforma pra voluntariado! | Everything works perfect! | For eveyone reading this review. JUST DO IT. LIFE IS TODAY!!! NOT TOMOROW Pedro | Is a great app, star to know your surroundings | Supongamos que aplic√°s/coordinas para hacer voluntariado en 10 hosteles. 7 de esos a los qje les mandaste para voluntariar, no te responden en la aplicaci√≥n (y es el √∫nico medio que tenes para comunicarte porque no hay nada de info) 1 te cancela la propuesta que hiciste de fechas para ir porque no le gusta que est√©s proponiendol√© a otros lugares ir, otro porque no sos lo que busca, y si CON SUERTE arregl√°s para quedarte en uno, vas a poder vivir la experiencia, busquen por su lado gente! üëéüèª | Aight | I can't believe that people are going to work for businesses that makes profit for free. It's not volunteering for a cause, it's abuse and it's illegal! | It's a wonderful way to give back to the world and see beautiful places with special people. It's an easy way to find places that need volunteers and explore new environments. Well worth the cost! | Amazing | Love itc | I heard this is the good app lets use it and I will then smash UpTo 5 stars. It is easy to use and a lot of information about How to an outstanding world packer . So I am changing three ‚≠ê s so if I able to to travel and approved with a host fly for the first time . I will add one star and it will be complete. Thanks for your reply. | Una excelente app! Si te gusta viajar, conocer buenos lugares y aprender sobre otras culturas, debes tenerla en tu cel. | Adorei o app, bem pr√°tico, f√°cil de usar e muito bonito! J√° estou com minha primeira viagem confirmada na plataforma!! :D | It's the best matching platform that connects people around the world. I can't picture my travel without Worldpackers. There might be some ways to keep trip cost down, but volunteer work makes that possible here, which helps build relationships with hosts. Wouldn't it be great to have genuine connections around the world? While the unexpected is sure to happen during travel. They provide a review system and travel insurance, which enable me to travel without worrying about anything unnecessary. | The app is THE ERROR! It doesnt even connect to sign up, what a bad joke! | You can find jobs like these ones that pay and provide housing. Honestly, for what the hosts ask of you, you deserve to be paid. | Very nice app | The best app I had 1 year in the Trip | Infinitas possibilidades e muitas, muitas oportunidades. WP can change your life! | Is it for real?? No one accept the request nor anyone responde already paid the money!! | Works well | U have to pay 50$ to use the app for a year, it seems to be a good way to see other places, but at least for me is a lil bit expensive | Very very very worst app | Great way to travel | On the phone it works really bad and most of the host don't respond the application, so there's little opportunity and no answers. Wouldn't recommend. | I'm a little worried about this application and I want to help | Awesome | I couldn't pass the birthdate. Waste of time. Test your apps before releasing. seriously. | Can not able to sign because DOB page isn't responding. | Terrible app... they take your money and promise you to get opportunities... unfortunately, most hosts don't respond and ignore your messages, otherwise, they decline.. choose travelers depend on nationality and race! The administration doesn't response... bunch of stealers! | Amazing!!! | Excelente plataforma, nos permite conocer los diferentes voluntariados, no solo en nuestro pa√≠s, sino en otros. Te permite formar parte de un equipo donde ofreces tus conocimientos y ayuda, y a cambio recibes alojamiento y alimentaci√≥n. | Good experience; user friendly | haven't used it | There's a delay at messages on the chat. Sometimes I need to send another message to see the answer to my last question for the host. | Kept bugging me about rating the app, other than that the app it works fine | The app its excellent. You can use a lot of filters to search the trip you want. Its really easy to use. Then if the hosters write you back or not is another story, but the funcionality of the app is wonderfull. | Facebook login is not working | Facebook login does not work | Poor customer service. Was looking out for help at support email id. But got no response. Also, very old reviews of all the stays searched for Bangkok. Seems dicey | Good. | My first time volunteering, the host didn't ask for a fee, but now I don't understand why most of the hosts ask for money to the volunteers, no chances to take because it is supposed that we are volunteers, we work to receive sth, but they are adding moneyü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so? You as an organization must review this. | Es la mejor aplicaci√≥n que algui√©n puede tener. Se pueden hacer voluntariados en m√°s de 130 pa√≠ses en donde todo el mundo puede participar. Gracias a los voluntariados aprend√≠ muchas cosas sobre la cultura y costumbres de otros pa√≠ses, adem√°s de que aprend√≠ ingl√©s, herramienta muy √∫til al momento de viajar y trabajar por el mundo. Hace 2 a√±os que llevo usando la app y pienso usarla por mucho tiempo m√°s. La super recomiendo!! | Sensational | $50 o mas solo para usar la aplicaci√≥n eso sin contar que hay voluntariados donde se tiene que pagar por d√≠a para ciertas cosas y adicional obviamente pagar tus pasajes y cosas adicionales que son necesarias.

Orded and paid the premium service, which never activated. I contact support, with no response at all. At least they should respond to the support request in order to fix the issue. Pretty bad. | I think it's definitely an interesting app, i just wish there was a way to view all of your favorited locations in a list format, or at the very least you could see your favorited places while further zoomed out when using the favorite filter. | Ovo niƒçemu ne slu≈æi. | Good | You cannot do or see anything without paying for it. The one location I saw was missing most of the key place. Uninstalled it within minutes | Amazing app with great features. On top the management of this app is very helpful and extremely responsive to any questions you may have. Over all a must have app for all avid travellers. | My go to Apps every time i plan for holidays | Have been using it for years, it is great | Est√° genial, pero necesita una funci√≥n para subir ficheros, PDF o im√°genes para poder registrar tickets o entradas. Aunque fuera de forma local en el tel√©fono estar√≠an m√°s a mano. Tambi√©n echo en falta alg√∫n apartado para anotaciones al viaje en global y no solo la descripci√≥n de cada d√≠a. Por lo dem√°s para crear itinerarios con anotaciones y gestionar el tiempo y las rutas entre cada lugar est√° estupendo. | Better than Visit a City!!!! | Amazing tool which has made planning several international trips easy. Sygic Travel gives you all the info about hours, cost and if prebooking is necessary. It also helps you schedule and map your days based on the proximity of the sites. I love that your schedule and maps can be accessed offline when you are overseas. | Maybe it was because I was using the free version but . . . I could only put a single hotel into a trip. Thus multi-hotel trips become multi-trips. Information whilst seemingly helpful was outdated (in Bologna the app was quoting information from 2016!). That does not lead to reliablity. | Love this app. Very handy for organizing trips in group. | Bought the Lifetime Pro version - I regret it. The added functionality is basically a copy of Wikipedia / WikiVoyage, and the provided information on the map are outdated (5+ years). There are suggested places that have been closed for a long time and yet they're still showing up on the map as a suggested spot. | The apps functionality is fantastic, but it need time to polish up certain difficulties in its user interface. it got me few hours to get the hang of it. One can use a computer instead of mobile to plan, which is super convenient. it does not find the local transport (when compared to google) but this allows to save a Detailed journey plan with times. A intro video guide would be very helpful! or just play with it for few hours! | Can be much better, atill slow and not that user friendly | This app is a constant of my trips abroad. Creating a plan for the days where we walk around the city and landmarks and then following it has almost become a tradition. | Amazing | Zak√∫pen√© premium st√°le zamra appka ned√° sa pou≈æi≈• vyhoden√© peniaze | Very useful app when traveling. Gives a nice overview of the nearby highlights with some information. The idea is to add highlights to a specific route and follow the generated walking route. Personally I like to freestyle a bit and add places to my favorite when I have visited them. This will mark them red on the app. Over the last year, the app has been slightly degrading, asking to rate the application almost everytime you open the app. It could definitely use some attention from the devs! | Abandoned app. No improvement since years. I really liked it but need some refreshment. It is getting outdated. | The app works fine and is quite useful, great support from the developer too! The app makes planning your trips and holidays much more enjoyable. | Nice app | Always useful, love this app! | Very useful and and can as well combine the car app as well . I have been using this app for years . Well done | You must pay to see content | Was really happy with this app, u till I updated my phone and lost all my past and present trips. Contacted the owner through email and no response. | Great for planning vacation and keeping track of places yo visit..

It also switched around hotel nights for bookings that I had canceled. Not sure what is going on but complete waste of money. | Good app for travel | Great app | Excellent | Before any of my trips, short weekend city breaks or long sun holidays, I always prepare with Sygic travel app! Very detailed, gives enough information on places to visit and the most that I like is day by day plan. I do recommend 100% | It used to be top notch but nowadays keeps crashing .. I've been using Sygic trip planner for nearly a decade, I'm a premium user, yet the second I try to use navigate function, the app crashes. Wrote to customer service team and still no feedback. I also have a flagship phone, so system requirements to run the app smoothly shouldn't be a problem.. Yet can't figure out why it keeps crashing. üôÑ 27-2-2023: navigation from the app still crashes. Is there any time-frame when this will be fixed? | Excellent | Doesn't do what I expected after much online research. If i had been able to trial premium I would not have purchased it. I find it's not intuitive to use. Thought I'd be able to use navigate to see what public transport options were available but it seems that's not available until I'm actually in the city and on the trip. The main reason I purchased premium was to pre plan using public transport and being able to save the search and update it when I needed it. Want a refund please. | Awesome tool to get the lay of the land and top attractions while also being able to plan detailed daily itinerary | Great for organising trips very informative | Wonderful | App can't find the sites we already have mapped out on google maps. Waist of money, don't pay for premium. Maybe is you are only visiting big cities and like the places the app picks for you then you would be ok. I want a refund. | Good info | Best travel app, everything for your travel . Easy helpfull. Recommend for for traveller's. | Must have app for travelling | Very good | Good app | A great piece of software. You better use the browser version (!) of the app. You can create very detailed itinerary with routes to link your places of interest even by selecting foot, plane, car, public transport. After having xrewted your schedule you can download everything onto your phone and make holidays like a pro. For the paper generation there is even the possibility to export your trip with details and guides as pdf and print it. Thanks for the app, it's worth every penny. | Free version of the app is basically useless. The interface is also dumb. | Good n easy | Very nice and useful app | Change my travel planning experience | Why i cannot add my own place? Place that do not exist in the list?

I planned all my trips with this app. | Love its | Good | have lots of attractions for u and great for planning the trips, it helps a lot | Excellent app and well worth a look at some of the out of the way places it brings up. Unfortunately after having zero problems it now cannot use maps even when downloaded. It just shows a straight line saying you are not online | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | Excellent travel application. I use this every time I travel. Keeps accommodation etc in one place | Waste of money. I could do more notepad | Awesome, love it. H | I planned a trip, but how to make it look like normal navigation? I cant it transfer to even sygic navi | Would be nice if you would inform users upfront that you have to pay for everything | Extremely versatile and i highly recommend for any one requiring work precision. | Nice to deal with you, thanks | Can't do anything until you PAY, but got EXACTLY what I needed from the Tripadvisor app, WHICH, by the way is FREE. Guess that's why there are a variety of apps available. | Works ok as an itinerary planner though adding your own personal private destination can be a bit clunky. It would be good if you there was a separate accommodation slot for each evening rather than including it in the day's places. Also when linking to sygic navigation, it doesn't work properly as it only shows you directions, not your ETA as you would normally see when mually loading a destination. Fix these issues and I'll happily upgrade the review üôÇ | Amazing apps for planning trips! | Incredible! Exactly what I wanted and more, Can't plan a trip without it! It's definitely my travel companion, Perfection! üòç | Great for trip planning and finding new things! | Fantastic options to plan your trip! | Good | On Android 11 (Fairphone 4) the app is constantly crashing. It can't even start. Do you have some news on this? I am not able to use this app ... I just downloaded the app from apkmirror and it works. so there is something wrong with the version on Google play. | Amazing app. Help me whith trips site 2013. | Amazing. Super helpful and easy to use. Well never take another trip without it! | Saya mimpi pergi ke KL lalu telefon policenya Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre | Best Itinerary App EVER!! I love this app. I have used a few itinerary apps including visit a city and this is by far the best one. It's super versatile so, can add your own stops if they don't exist in the app, can download & use it off line & you can download your itinerary into a PDF to print and take with you or just keep as a souvenir/ keepsake. The only slightly annoying thing is when using the map offline, your position jumps around and you can't use it like you would google maps. | Maps downloads erroring out. Not able to use it effectively UPDATE 1: After trying out the steps provided by the developer, the issue is resolved. I am going to try out the app for a upcoming trip to evaluate it further. | Not worth the money,. regret the purchase. | All the tools you need to plan and to navigate abroad | ⁄ÅŸàÿß⁄© ÿ≥ÿßÿ™ŸàŸÜ⁄©€å | Not installed i use osmand+ | Useless without subscription | Easy tool to plan with | Not everything is up to date. But it helps to find lots of other places. I am recommending this app. Updates are added regularly | unable to synch with mob app. Waste of time setting up tons of places to visit...dont bother | Updated edit: I really like this app, use it so much that ive purchased premium. However, lately info seems to be a bit off. Especially attractions entry fees. The most annoying thought is that every 5 seconds there's a pop up saying that ""ive unlocked sygic"". It drives me crazy. My notifications are off. Could you please remove that? Thanks. | Was simply the best, offline GPS navigation application. Far, Far, superior to Google Maps BUT the latest update of removing the ""over speed"" advice. Replacing with change of speed ahead advice. Has removed a major reason for choosing this app above others. | Excellent | Excellent app for travel | This is a helpful app to plan a trip in the US, and then use it to navigate in countries such as France and Italy. Worth the money | Great app | Hen√ºz denemedim ama ≈üu an GPS yazƒ±lƒ±mlarƒ±nda en iyi ≈üirket Sygic hatalara devam etmesine raƒümen, bu uygulamada ba≈ülangƒ±√ß noktamƒ± se√ßemedim √ß√ºnk√º listede yok! O y√ºzden yakƒ±n bir b√∂lgeyi i≈üaretledim | Not used | Good | 1.) Address search needs improving 2.) Adding my own location is buggy (cant add/disappear after trying to add) | Great travel planner. Needs improvement to add tickets and flights automatically from emails as other travel planners | Great | I just used 3 times, and I have no regrets about it. I would recommend for sure. | Love this, makes travel easy | Very close to useless, can't even import the trip using booking number | Confusing interface, difficult to actually make it do anything useful. | App is Ok | Thank you for your effort to keep it up . | üëçüèº | Works for me. | Perfect | I just came across your app and found it to be awesome. However I feel there are some features you should add on the app for a more personalised experience *Notes - 1 should be able to add notes, reminders , or drop important links in the trip/or to a particular destinaton in the trip *Photos- It will personalise user experience, and your team will also grt great pictures to share. Again adding to a particular location & to the overall trip will be best *Location- users/Sygic can find new places | Very good app | Fun to explore by my fingertips. | Good app | Easy to use, helpful | Keep crashing. | Great for planning trips. Very intuitive and powerful features. Go for the premium - great Value for money | I used the free version on several occasions so I bought the premium feature. Now all the places on the map flashing so my eye hurt. People do something to make it gone. If I want to see sightseeing places , and put them into my itinerary I can't care less if the place is a park or a museum or a square even. Doesn't make sense anyway. | I love this app. It show you some places to go | Doesn't have the destinations that Tripit has. Try for example Grand hotel Reykjavik. Tripit found it in an instant. Sygic travel not. Sorry, but I'm uninstalling | The best travel plan I used | Very easy to use.. They have all the spots we wanted to hit plus have ideas for others. | Nice app | Good application. The main issue is with notes not being kept when a place is moved to another date. Otherwise a very useful program | Looks nice but is useless without subscription of 15 euros (lifetime). Uninstalled after 3 minutes | As soon as you leave the hotel (wifi) it doesn't work. The discriptions of places appaer sometime is Russian. I don't trust this app | HELP! How do I unsubsidized from this app, I don't want auto-pay to take another $24 from my account when this year is over. Apparently customer service isn't available through the app or online!? PLEASE HELP! | ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶∏ ‡¶Ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶∏ | I hope if there are a specific places lists I made it myself | Best of its kind | I dont know what this app is good at... It is not as good as maps(free) and it doea not give any good advise... Useless | It's a subscription based service, and the free app is practically useless without it | Very good | Well functioning app | Very useful to plan a trip | The Android app is much better than Iphone for that reason I did not give 5‚òÜ | E una presa in giro . Vi manda su google maps che funziona con la rete | Very helpful | Locked up my device. No maps to download. | I am using it during my recent travel and its helping me to find famous and interesting places to see in different tourists destinations. Thank you Sygic. | Everything is good. | Purchased premium because cooperation with Android Auto was problematic. Now with premium subscription I experience the same trouble in navigation view. To be more frustrated trying to cancel the subscription but it seems that function is well hidden somewhere. It seems that the solution is to refuse payment when it is due. Any help is appreciated. | THE DEVELOPER IGNORES EMAILS!!! ............I have not received any answer despite number of reminders... I just want to know how can I change the language of the Sygic Travel mobile app? On web I can change it to several languages, however in mobile app I don‚Äôt see such an option. I don‚Äôt‚Äô want to change the language of my phone‚Ä¶ I need to stay the phone language in English‚Ä¶ | 2 advertising tracking api in the program. Update 5 tracking api | Very helpful | Ive used this for 3 trips to NYC. App did a fantastic job helping me when I had never been there before. however now as I'm planning one to Chicago, I'm noticing some issues. I don't recall needing to pay to view an image attached to a location. I'm big on architecture, but I can't see what anything looks like so I have to go back and forth between Google. Also, app is not up to date on establishments. Nearly every restaurant Ive typed in isn't in the app | Nice app | Purchased the app to compliment Sygic Navigation. It installed correctly but when attempting to open the navigation app it wouldn't open. It just gave you the option to close the app or contact customer support. Just what you need when abroad and your primary nav app no longer works. No way to back up routes or trips because of the failure to open,so all gone. Had to uninstall the app and reinstall and now have to download maps again. But all my favourites, routes and places gone. | Very nice | Since my review the app has been improved dramatically. Almost all my remarks have been considered and the features implemented and the performance improved.Now it is really an excellent app, so thanks to the team. I would suggest a couple of possibilities: 1. Recently, Triposo went down, it was good on grouping of cities, sightseeing, national parks etc, adding this feature would be great; 2. To integrate POIs from national parks guide; 3. Export as a table e.g excel file as an agenda for notes | I'd get premium if there's timeline/transportation method feature | Uygulama g√ºzel fakat bi tu≈ü olsa ve basƒ±nca bulunduƒüumuz konuma g√∂re o g√ºnl√ºk gideceƒüimiz yerleri en kƒ±sa mesafeye g√∂re ayarlasa | After deleting it and reinstalling it, the download was successful, thank you. | I love this app I've used it to plan a week on Vegas and vermont..South Carolina and Galveston are planned. Makes it easy to plan all the things you want to do. Awesome! | Doesn't state that you have to pay $15 a month or more to use this! Too many free trip planners to be charging subscriptions for something people only use a few times a year. | Exceptional useful ap while planning travel. Makes maximising any trip a breeze as it highlights all things you would want to see and works out how much you typically spend there and travel distance and time to the next destination | Ok | Very good | Needs improvements, there is no link between the days. Also you can see the days i itinerary view but no info on the day unless you click into it. | Does not work for Vegas. You can't add a hotel to the itinerary without it thinking you are staying the night there. This is fine for most places but Vegas hotels are destinations | Very easy to use. I like the places feature. It shows you all of the major points of interest for just about anywhere. | Not useful app, better Google use it | No prioritizing. Just listing | Very helpful app, I am using this app last four years, anytime I plan to travel, just using this app to find things to do. | Best app","{""1"":339,""2"":679,""3"":1739,""4"":3638,""5"":11136}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†99.99 - CZK¬†799.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","Tripomatic s.r.o.","4834904393905700904","team@tripomatic.com","https://travel.sygic.com","Tripomatic s.r.o.

Have used it in Paris, New York, London and Bristol. The functionality is great. Highly recommend. | Always so helpful getting around in big cities!! | good | unbelievably helpful in London | don't leave home without it üòé | Great app in cities it works. I used the app in DC not long and and it was great. So I thought this app will be great on my recent trip to Bangkok, only to find this app does not work in Bangkok. Super disappointed. | Super helpful navigating buds and subway transit across a new city. The app even provides info on which exits to take from the station and which part of the train to sit in. | The best application | there is no more stops shown in city map from highwaydown to littlehampton so we need to update. | After Citymapper was sold to Via, they don't read or reply to emails with suggestions or bug reports. Citymapper lost the friendly touch. It's not the same company anymore. | Good app | Neat little app, though I do wish it could show the buses locations in real time if possible. Also the ability to see the arrival time for walking right next to the minutes it takes to walk. | easy to use and give accurate information about your journey | Almost always shows wrong time for buses on TFL | Arrive time not update | The route screen is misleading. London Overground and Elizabeth line are not tube lines. Also, the train departure board is hard to use unlike the tube one - trains should be ideally shown in the same way as tubes and buses. | Best way to navigate New York City | very good app and also so precise | best | I used it in London and I found it extremely useful... | very accurate in its suggestions, especially with bus timings | Really bad working!! It's was really good time ago but i don't know what Change... Only i can relate that every time it have a problems online. Changing bus timing, confusing stations, ect | Awesome app . No comments. Everything is just like we want | Best app! | Good but sometimes you also need to double check | So Useful Thanks Alot City Mapper. | Better for central London / tube connected London. Could be better for South London train network - train options don't come up even if it is the shorter option because it isnt the soonest option. Train only doesnt quite hit the mark for those that take a bus first to the traon. Need a shortest journey option! Calendar event functionality used to be great but no longer works after I changed phones. | fab | I used this app for 3 months ,with my 3 children we missed buses so many times and because it always gave wrong time ,we waited so many times in bus stops . The WORST APP so far ,from it gave wrong arrival time , I deleted it now | Helps me get wherever I'm going, whatever city I'm in. And many different options. It's great | awesome üëçüòé | Must have travel app, the quickest way to find and track your journeys | very helpful | best for almost all cities really | Absolutely smashing app. Pulls nearly all travel data giving you an honest set of plans getting you from A to B via all the in betweens. My only tiny gripe is the app didn't pickup that a late train had to cancel a few stops (one of mine), but thanks to it i knew the next few coming shortly after. Bravo team, this version of your app is super! | This one is the ish for public transportation. | really helpful app. the best in London. | Great app and I use it all the time but the fares need updating! | Nice choice | Makes getting around a breeze! | Much better than Google maps at being accurate with locations, timings and public transport schedule. | excellent app. brilliant for London and Paris - not had chance to try it elsewhere | easy to travel in my country. | Probably one of the best apps out there and is highly comparable to Google Maps. | Considering how many transport operators share data to other planning tools like Google maps, the coverage on a global basis is poor. In the UK you pair up Birmingham and Nottingham as one yet don't have bus planning options in the area in between. There seems to be no way to select multiple forms of transport to plan (eg in London, tube plus rail plus bus) so you're left with everything. Not everyone wants to cycle and there's no way to filter out the dozens of Lime type bikes on the map. | Amazing app. I have full confidence riding metros in cities I've never been using this. I've used it in NYC and Montr√©al Canada. I love it | Easily navigation, live updated options of transportation | really good app for navigation but sometimes for 8-11 mins trips it tells you to walk when you don't want to. | very good app. | very useful üëå üëç | City mapper makes travel around London easy | First use and already love it! | Best app to move yourself in London and Toronto | The best transportation app in Paris | it's a good app that's why I gave it five stars | nice | must always have 2nd opinion to travel suggestions. Hope they'll expand their map usage to more countries. | really fantastic app..But why are there no widgets for the Android App like for the iPhone... I don't mind going into the app but a widget would be nice | absolutely brilliant | The app works as intended. I think it's better than Google Maps when using it for transit routing. Especially in major cities. For example in NYC it incorporated express buses in options. You would have to toggle with that in Google maps. | What the heck happened to CityMapper? The recent drop-off in quality has been PRECIPITOUS! My theory is that the company closed down and nobody remembered to disable the thing. Anyway, it used to be great but now pretty much no longer functions. Very weird that it's still available given that it doesn't seem to, like, be a real thing anymore. Very disappointing, because it really did used to be great. Now? All but unusable. Such a shame. | Really easy to use, especially because it works excellently with wear os | Garbage. Put in a location and showed me the map and route for Uber, bus routes, walking, but no driving directions | overall good. | helped me not to get lost so far | good | very accurate! | Still as good and better than it was 8 years ago | Mandatory app for anyone living in big cities. Love that they provide combination of travel options, ie tube and busses, and times are generally correct. Can't be without it, 5/5 | excellent | My most used app. Great for public transport across cities as well as for cycling - the quiet cycle routes are the best I've found across all the navigator apps available. Highly rated by me! | Very well made, I use it every day. | Far superior to Google maps. | amazing app | This is the best app for transit riders, hands down! | Really good for giving you up to date public transport info | Great app, worthy of any Londoner. | tell where I need to go with details | It works | Absolutely essential | very helpful 99% of the time | just works | Want to use it but my city (Madison, WI) or any city in WI for that fact is not supported. :( | Good | most of the time it's a lifesaver. But there are the odd occasions when it has a strop and doesn't give the best route | Great app, but could do with an update to reflect the correct prices, I'm in London and the train fares increased at the beginning of this month so it would be great to know what routes may be cheaper. | Amazing | Used this app in London to navigate the underground and in Edinburgh and it is really helpful! | Best ever travel app for tourists | Great map app Only issue , if I try mapping from the Wear OS app, it always fails to find a route or do anything, but starting from my phone and showing on watch works fine | good job to Maker | Route suggestions very bizarre. This morning it came up with Bus & bus 62 minute; Walk, bus & train 66 minutes. But in the panel below ('Bus Only') there was a quicker 40 min option. Same weirdness this afternoon. Suggested a bus leaving in 8 minutes giving me a total journey time of 40 minutes. But in the Bus Only box below, an alternative nearer single bus journey of 32 minutes. Why are the quicker (and sometimes cheaper) options not in the prominent first 'Suggested' box? | Not precise bus hours | Better than TFL's own timings boards and app | Very useful and user friendly | TUESDAY MONDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY | Update 3/18/24. STILL BROKEN ON ANDROID 14. Currently broken on android 14. No response from developers email. Continues crashing upon opening on pixel 6 android 14. | Lost the option to get notified only during commute time. I don't know where to find the settings because even the tutorial on the official website shows a button that does not exist in this app. What a stupid team. | Used for a trip to NYC for bus and subway and it was great. | Good for finding routes but doesn't give you enough time for transferring | the best ever | Easy to use, and gets you where you need to go in NYC and the surrounding area. it's been more reliable for me than Google Maps | Messing up roots, never offering a good on foot route, from time to time forgets there are also buses to a destination and other times dropping trains! Suggests stops that are farther from the destination instead of the best. It's not updated in regards with the blocked roads etc | excellent app to use in London! works perfectly and I definelly reccomend, always precise. | Useful app, but regularly recommends routes with 0-2 minute platform changes, which are impossible to make, even when running at the speed of Usain Bolt. | Could be easier to go back and compare options | Love this app. have used it in multiple cities. | Brilliant! I use the bus option frequently | would love a watch app | I think it's the best app for london | I LOVE IT! | best stop | It stopped working android 14 | awesome | excellent service, gets me to my location easily except for some cases it just feeezes. | Super useful...so long as your city happens to be one supported by the app. Biggest improvement I would like to see: minimizing elevation changes (e.g., hills) when plotting walking/biking routes. Admittedly, that is easier said than done. | while the trip duration does not account for traffic, it's nice to see how much of an impact my transit trip is having on the environment and how much money I save vs driving. it also is helpful to remind me when to get off and where to go when I get off which is helpful both when I know the bus route and I don't so that I can relax a little on my long bus journey's | not always reliable info | Great app, incredibly useful to navigate many cities. Excellent UI, very easy to use. | It's a really good app, can we suggest to add some places name that are missing from the list? | Absolute lifesaver and time saver for those travelling in and around London... Birmingham... Newcastle... Amsterdam... Used it so many times | the best I have been using | a very good application overall, we will see how this develops in the future. it may be missing integration with VTC services, and surrounding taxis üöñ Or maybe I'm blind ü¶Øü¶Æ | Works well in Manchester, will make sure that it works all over the UK. | App keeps crashing on 366 route from barking | useful in every major city I've been to. great app | Very good | it's a really good app for public transport and the times are actually accurate 10/10 would 100% recommend x | It is good to use like another option to get google Maps. | Best map City app so far | Much better than Google Maps. Elegant UI and better GPS and travel routes. Always use this for travelling now | By far the best app we found for getting around London! The instructions are easy to follow, and you get great options. | Uncontested best public transport app out there (as long as it's available in your city/region) | Great around London and timings, maps and directions work well | best app for the UK transportation | an awesome app I regard as my best friend on the go! | Wonderful app! WearOS version could use a facelift and reliability improvements though. Would be nice to quickly start saved trips from the watch app! | limited in scope and options | never in REAL time | Great App | nothing to complain | easy to used | Very helpful in London, it correctly calculated the travel with the underground, taking into account some temporary closures of certain stations. | Better than the transit app but missing routes that are essential. | Recently the app is closing and stopped working more frequently. | Awesome best app for London","{""1"":10836,""2"":0,""3"":0,""4"":43346,""5"":216731}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†39.00 - CZK¬†2,490.00 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Citymapper Limited","7691438629453514158","support@citymapper.com","http://citymapper.com","6th Floor

Never disappoints | Awsome deals | Seems great so far! | Great amd easy to use! A friend of every traveler for sure ! | From departing to arriving was great. | Sweet deals | Great prices!!! Wony go anywhere else!! | terrible web site. gave me a price of $350 but wouldn't let me finish the transaction. Five minutes later the price went up to $500 | Saved me alot of money.....I highly recommend! | Good | Great resonable prices | Does what it says it does. Which these days is a feat. Would recommend for anyone trying to save money and not deal with the hassle of figuring out the right time to buy a ticket. | Absolutely great!!!! | Amazing , lots of savings . | I love this, it's very helpful | It's made life so much easier | Always guaranteed lowest prices | Great App | Thank you for your app and services | Love the advice on when to wait and average price changes, great app to check flights | Nice working and clear app design. But the best feature in my opinion is the fact that when you search for a flight Hopper automatically puts up a price alert for that flight. | great | Hopper is easy to use and the customer service is very responsive. | Great discounts!!! | this was my first time using Hopper. It was simple.and easy. | Great Service! | I like to use it to check the price before I buy! | awesome | Quick ,easy, affordable | I have relatives and friends that uses the app I'm hearing great reviews about it ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Very good, no problems | Helps me find cheap flights and hotels | Absolute scam & waste of time. I had $200 in vouchers for a room from referals, but no matter the hotel, the date, or the card I used, it would not let me use those vouchers. ""Couldn't confirm payment details"" all my info was correct, their support was either incompetent (told me my vouchers had expired March 2024 and this was in August of 2023!!!!!) or absolutely useless. Steer clear of this app. To devev: I NEVER GOT A CONFIRMATION BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T LET ME MAKE A BOOKING WITH MY VOUCHERS!!! | the Hopper app made me make a mistake on booking and also Hopper agents take forever like days to reroute my flight.. but I thank Hopper for allowing me in my past flights but I am unhappy and unsure I want to use Hopper.. | Great | fast easy and secure...loving it | Super | Great so far‚òÜ | always showing the best deals‚ÄºÔ∏è | Best rates most often, able to save passengers info Fer quick booking, bonus carrots towards flights, low rate flight insurance and more. | love this app, they let you know when it's a good time to book and when it is not plus they plant trees for every booking | Always has the best options and carrot cash can lower your fees! | Love it! | Easy as pie | Never had an issue. Great app for booking all your flights. I don't think I've ever booked a hotel with the app, but it's very convenient to use. | So far the app works well. Very convenient and user friendly. | Great updates, no nonsense, makes my travel plans easier | Great Savings and Easy to use! | Love it, so very helpful. | good app to use | Super easy to use! Great updates for cheapest flights! | Love it! | Great app helped me so much | I used this app for Hotel stays and it was a great experience | Great app very flexible | ease of use | Solid options for trips | Easy to use, great proices | Very reliable and great prices | Garbage üóëÔ∏è: Cancelled several trips I had already paid for w/ no refund.. knew price was too good to be true | actually incredible and really look for cheap price | I just got here and our place is beautiful!!! | Solid app but feels sketchy | Best app üëå üôå | Worst customer service ever, you should use expedia | Very dependable great information for travel | Really decent flight suggestions! | I use this app to compare prices for all my trips! | My go to app for all my flight needs | I was able to book room for 4 nights at $20.00 / night | Great app, extremely helpful | Very helpful in finding less expensive flights. | deals where lol its just as expensive as any other app | Great app, glad it was finally updated! | fast and easy! | Always had a great experience with this app and the customer service is outstanding. The flight and hotel reservations are easy to make and has great prices. | Easy to use and money saver | Easy to use! | This booking service causes so many problems. Dishonest and shady ad tactics. Promises of things never received. I have exclusively used hopper for a year. Hoping to see things that never come. I will be looking for another provider for this service. I'm tired of the problems I deal with almost every weekend. | Great prices alert you as soon as the price change something you should consider using often | This App rules, saved me some time and money | Haven't booked yet so I'll report back! | Do not trust this site fake promotions and they will take your money without giving you a confirmation number. | I've found some amazing deals on Hopper. I used to plan my trips and then try to find cheap fairs. Now I find cheap fairs and plan my trips around that lol thanks Hopper. | Everytime I try to book a room it's says something went wrong. So I refresh the app and do it again and now the room went up $10 and still says something went wrong, did it a third time and the same room went up another $7 and still says something went wrong. I'll just stick to Priceline and the other apps. | The discount | very affordable and quick way to get flights and rooms | Easy to use | I love it | Hopper was supposed to watch a flight and notify me of price changes. When I go to book the flight i'm notified last minute that the flight was now $420 more and if I'd like to continue. I choose not to and go directly to American Airlines to check on the same flight which the price had not gone up. Today I go on hopper and look at flights and the same flight price was shown as the one I was going to book. I go through to book it and AGAIN the price ""just changed"" Customer service was clueless. | Good offers | Love it | Totally satisfied every time I use it | I have been waiting for my refunds for couple weeks now and still haven't received it. This app is a joke | Best app ever since I have it I'm very happy with the service | Love Hopper because they have great deals. | Excellent | First timer | Awesome can beat the prices and the easy steps. Good job | always great experience with hopper | I love it | Easy to use and find a good deal on flights! | It's pretty straight forward and efficient! I've found great flight deals here especially | Awesome rates | The best app to get the best price | Always the best deals... Have never had an issue using this app. | Great app. Reasonable prices. | A very useful, helpful, and great App. | I personally love it, great deals | I love hopper always get great deals and love the flexibility hopper is a great app. | Savings savings savings | Works as advertised | I been finding the best deals but lately they have been higher than other sites like Priceline. | Easy to use, good prices. | I got the least inexpensive flights from all the other sites , and wasn't charged any thing extra. My first choice in booking my flights | Hopper has been amazing, every time I need to go somewhere this is my first stop and it's always the least expensive! Great app | The hopper app is great for saving money on fairs. It has not steered me wrong once and I have always saved money whether booking through Hopper or directly with the carrier after finding the best rate on Hopper | great | Very helpful app | Awesome üòé | Love | Nice hotel services | Easy to use. Highly recommend. | Great | Great app for comparing flights, I find Hopper is cheaper than the other ones. | Thank you | Fantastic | App Is very simple and useful, recomend 100% | All good! | Awsome app. | Wonderful | Fast, accurate, reliable. | great | This app has never let me down. But you don't get to keep Hilton points | I'm just trying Hopper, hopefully I can leave some good reviews in the near future! | Great app. | I've been using this app for years, it's easy to use, and saved me a lot of money! Even used it to go to Italy! | All your deposits are non refundable and they don't communicate with the hotel, they don't have the proper information for bookings and whenever a problem comes up they always push it onto the hotel. I downloaded this app for a trip and showed up and they had put me and my friend in for a single bed instead of the 2 I reserved so now I have $200 gone that could've been used for anything else. AVOID THIS APP. ITS A RIPOFF! | A very good app | gave me three different prices for the same hotel/ room size.. when I added my discount the price went UP. when I contact customer support the rep told me I was wrong and that it cannot be possible when I was looking at the screen, when I offered screenshots I couldn't get an email. | I rated it one star because the bad service cost me $200+ because of the advice of one of the customer service reps based abroad, to cancel and rebook my hotel with promise of a refund within 3-5 business days. It's been 2 months now and when I try to call the automated system says I don't qualify for VIP service, my case has been flagged in their system so I get the run around and not speak to anyone. Even the email reply is automated. Curse you Hopper! I want my money back! | A bit confusing booking flights | It's very effective in tracking flight fee to get the best deal. | Finally a hotel website that lets you see the REAL price for a room A++ | Hopper comes thru for me every time! | Loved | It's always given me great hotels and wonderful suggestions! | The app doesn't allow me to input my passport info for airline bookings; therefore, I went on another app to make my bookings, and I git a better price there. | I love it it's bringing down the price of my trip to Florida it's giving me alerts just by | Fast way to hotel rooms | Nice | Frustrating but I figured it out. | I will NEVER USE THIS AGAIN. I bought tickets for me and my sister. And I wanted to get another ticket FOR THE SAME FLIGHT for my other sister, who is a minor. It won't let me. Saying she is an unaccompanied minor. She ISN'T. it's THE SAME FLIGHT THAT I'M ON. I just wasn't sure she was going with us until later. I tried calling. It won't connect me to a person. It repeats the same message over and over to find a hopper ID to get help. IT'S NOT THERE. IT WANTS ME TO PAY $5 TO GET HELP. M-37ZC71 | Awesome | Pathetic | Love this app | Customer service is awesome üëåüèΩ | Love love. My go to for plane tickets!!! | Best flight price | Very cheap and a easy app to use thanks alot hopper | I have used the app to compair and see what is availablr | Would rate 0 this app is known for being super shady. I had booked a room through them over a week in advance. They took the money off of my card but surprise they never actually sent it to the hotel. When I called about this and asked for a refund I was denied it saying it was past my check in time but since the money was never sent I couldn't check in anyways. I suggest sending any disputes with them to your bank I have already done so and am awaiting results. Will not be interacting with them | Very bad service.....not option to call Customer care... | Impressed. As a travel agent for over a decade, now a UX design/CX experience consultant, I'm extremely critical of digital platforms. However, Hopper offers excellent pricing/price protection, ux navigation, & customer support functionality. It is evident that the team behind the app seek, take, & implement user feedback to consistently improve the platform. Recommend the app to my entire personal, professional, and digital network consistently. Will continue to be a highly satisfied user! | Garbage. Unnecessary fees everywhere; they try to make it so you can't cancel without paying extra, even when the hotel itself has lenient cancelation policies. This ""service"" saved neither money nor time. It just made it a messy nightmare. | Awesome rates and updates | Amazing cheap | Easy to use and I've found flights on this app that aren't on the airline website | Love this app gives you all the options | I put a freeze on a hotel and a week later checked a few other companies. I found it cheaper on a different website and when I called hopper to see if they would price match. All the guy wanted to know is if I wanted to get a refund. When I explained I would like to get a price match I got I'm sorry we can't refund the fees and I have to cancel the freeze. Besides I could barely understand the customer service guy. Will never deal with them again. Worse customer service ever. | I have always founded the best deals. This app is just awesome! | I missed my connection flight and since I brought the insurance my next flight was much cheaper. | Great way to find cheap tix | Keeps me informed | there is no done button to take you back to the previous screen after selecting an airport. | Awesome. Great deals | very handy | However it shows me the best price, it doesn't let me buy the ticket. This app is simply waste of time... | My family and I traveled to Atlanta via Jet Blue then Savannah by way of a rental car..Hopper provided us with a great discount.The trip was great. | It is helpful a lot to find the best flights ‚úàÔ∏è üëå | great | Best app for travel | Found a great ticket last minute... way cheaper than booking directly through the airlines! | Good app | I have a tour agency in Costa Rica and we suggest Hopper to all of our potential clients. | So far I love it. I like that it updates you on flights/trips you're interested in! | The fact that this app can predict when to expect fluctuations in prices is awesome. Not giving 5 stars yet because I have yet to purchase tickets. | Easy and functional | It's been a great way to get the best price for a quick flight or even longer international ones! Highly recommended | This app is a great way to find savings without all of the hassles of other sites. Simple to use and it allows you to set a watch for price adjustments on flights. | Hopper does not honor their return policy. I have to fight tooth and nail for a refund. | I love this app also recommend to everyone | I Love this App. | Very good | Very helpful. | I'd still rather speak to a person, customer service. Only because of my vision issues. | I love Hopper! | genial üëçüèæ | Very convenient keeps an eye on flights for you!","{""1"":15641,""2"":5213,""3"":10427,""4"":20855,""5"":79944}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Hopper Inc.","Hopper+Inc.","help@hopper.com","https://www.hopper.com",,"https://hopper.com/legal/privacy-notice","Hopper+Inc.","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wlYIPXC8F0EFUPAqP0FdjveY0BoEoa4y3hVAM5pwRtmzp1AXiWZpMCvklouZgvurLtw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LqhKi_WgZ-j8lBS9aZeCGsfXN1_JjFB9HaCz40cJ99FvRGNSYLhF089NBQP0yrJxrbI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RuKlzt6yt6O41sxih1jRGR4rS_4C8hvqIhKlGqhg5V9VSzxVf-xMXMpki3qRFqqRZg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SwYwjWBDBZcIwx6MTMVNXYch7LzzuQxPobRBEXsnBtY9WB8K3gdy4nGy-kmcn1WxAces"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qLBbn2ujvPOLZhlT1saBod4vc3ooxm6jE2f4aHh6V1onsmLgaHZzZ44r_Fwt5MXdiCs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H6tDU7x4zbwI6rulpdBT2gfVgGDSKP2r4iA0qrYMcJkjifw5_tDD6mIzXhzqFlVoKQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KQa6is5Z8bLsPu0txseOv1IVqgxgkAT8ZEyxI-y08-jYUEkfkd3UZ_ARwgsUjyYk2Vw9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X-GIe6oJ1j-Ax3a--23zuvY5q_XiC2gDvIkmGYp1vF9tVmcs7XTgGyO13QY7wRTqd9k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b3RMD6jhmhnu8oUd3S0_zi-iveg_WKiue2Wjr5qIGPmSXg9H47NdJrVgg51I_YxASfo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Le15I1oFZWqvnCY3Siu5A1UxIOKyDjcG2rQ2HVdwJwr6cF7uOLnh_9AjPnX93-RfgjgN""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Aug 30, 2015",1711389602000,"5.56.0","Bug fixes and UI improvements<br>","[""Impressed.

What a gem, will love looking back at the places I've marked! | Awkward I spent time adding my pins, then I could not see my pins, apart from a list of places I've been too. I just wanted a simple map to mark where I have been. | Not what I hoped for. | The best app for tracking travel in a clear and satisfying way! Really a gem! | Limited to 50 destinations (pins) after that you have to pay 30$/monthly | Best app for travellers keeping track of our experiences thru photos and pin points. Keep up the good work! | you have to pay to add pins. Once you add your initial pins in the sign up you can not go back an add more. If you try, it will take you to the subscription page, then when you click ""continue with free version"" the app will kick up off the new pin page. | Great app for pin maps | the free version is awful. hard to navigate and keeps taking you to the paid subscription page | Very easy to use and great way to track our travels. | Not for me | Scam | I guess this isn't what I need. I want a map I can put the pins in for destinations I have been to and the interesting places I stopped at along the way. This does not work for that. | Great app, I use this to keep track of all the places our angel Katie's memory rocks travel to..I've been using it for a long time with no issues then a couple of days ago it wouldn't load..I emailed the creators who did everything they could to help resolve the issue which they did..id been so worried that I'd lose all the destinations but they made sure the problem was resolved as soon as possible and kept in touch throughout, they couldn't have been more helpful and I can't thank them enough. | Too freaking difficult to use | Limits you to just 50 pins unless you pay the premium. It is not worth the greed. | seems to freeze when flicking between it and other Pps, but really useful for planning trips | bit of a scam... the app is very quiet about the limit of 50 pins on the free version until you hit that threshold | $40?!? Nevermind. I'll just go buy a real wall map and a box of 1,000 pins. Shouldn't cost me more than $10. Shame, too, cuz I was pretty addicted to this app. Was getting all ready to show my friends. Nice hook, and it may have worked if it had been $5 or even $10. | It is a good app for noting down where you have been and where you want to go in the future. I do think it could benefit from having a global view of the planet. | limited to 50 pins for a free user. obviously not mentionned before you download and register.. uninstalled | This app is rubbish. Google maps is far much better | 50 pins max before you hit pay wall | I like this app a lot. Question... I'm using this app to log locations of a large community. I need a way to place more than one pin in the same city. Also, when I share my map, is there a way to display the alias names next to the city? Right now, the shared map is very generic looking. | Map keeps flickering up and down like it's resizing | Really awful, difficult to use, clunky. Felt like it was designed in a school competition | Cool concept, but can't tap into many of the features or use it functionally long-term if you don't pay. | Amazing app. Very useful and easy to use. It will be especially useful for those who like to travel or are planning their trips. | the idea of paying just to get extra pins is kinda ridiculous. just easier to move on to different apps. it's pins we are talking about, not some essential stuff we really need in our lives. a shame really, because the app looks nice | Crashed every single time on Pixel Pro 7. | very good and has a better system than to what TripAdvisor has. however, there are a few bugs that make the app not smooth. the app has crashed before as well. I am unsure if this is because there a few updates yet to come out. but all in all a good app | You have to manually enter every pin. Thought this app would be easier to use. It was a disappointment and thankfully I was refunded the $40. Perhaps I didn't read what it offered properly. I thought the paid version might use Google maps to integrate places I've already been into the app. It did not. I also thought that while looking at the map I would be able to click a city name and get an option to add to my list. Nope. I expected one of those basic benefits. | Photos won't upload or could be accessed. | Would like to be able to move pin within a city | premium yikes but so good otherwise | pretty good travel tracker. menus are a bit cumbersome, and it would be nice to add custom locations. | doesnt show all pins | creative helpful app | I trust LCC | O app desmarca os lugares que voc√™ marcou. | Won't let me add pins. Open the app it say enter your home town the ln click on the desire pin then click add pin There is no button that say add pin. I touch the pin I enter my address. I enter the town. I touch the pin. Nothing happens it throws other pins up. I touch them nothing just an I in a circle show up. When I push that again nothing happens when I look at the pictures here there is menu at the bottom. It's not on my screen | Wont even let me add my hometown let alone use the app. Fix it! | This is the best travel util app that I have ever seen, thanks | Useless- wouldn't even plot a pin | You only have 50 pins. Then you have to pay for the upgraded version. Pointless. | I paid for premium and it still wont work. Screwed out of 42 dollars. Trash. Tried to fix it and charged me a second time and still wont work. Thanks for taking my money crooks | does not work | Greedy. | Limits you to 20 or so pins then you have to pay. | Option to add pictures does not work.. | The app is really good and the devs listen to bug reports and feedback. A great team! | Doesn't work | Worth spending money on the lifetime use. It does not allow more than about 47 pins unless you pay. | Dont waste ur time, like 20 pins before ur restricted to pay. Also no suggestions to save time, tap to add pin and it adds 3. | costs too much | I could only pin once before being told I had to subscribe & I'm sorry but a pin tracking app is a bit of fun but not worth actual money... | meh, not friendly, short attention span, trying to plan a road trip here, can't drop a pin without a pop up asking for money. I'm gonna go | Payment needed to realy make it work | lovely app. simple to use | Please, update you app. Prishtina is in Kosovo not Serbia. :)) | Have to pay to place more pins :( | What a waste of my time. App is ok. But you get sucked in then find if you have been to 50 places they charge you to sign up for premium to add more than 50 locations.... be warned ‚ö†Ô∏è | As a trucker I like the app to be a le to track where I have been, I'm trying to hit every state in my territory and such. But lately it stopped adding pins, I hit add pins and it just doesn't add for 5 different cities.. I only have 49 pins at the moment and can't add certain cities for whatever reason. | No. Just no... | Showed up as a sponsored result on a Google search of ""virtual travel map with pins"" and of course it let's you place your first pin, asks you to register for more, then after you give your email is when it tells you you have to pay. I uninstalled and marked their email verification email as spam. | Love it! | Okay till it decided that I should get premium and won't let me continue without signing up. | Paywall | Just wants you to pay to put more pins. | limited | This App is allright. But I realised I woulld not need the features it provides. Also its great since I did not get charged was give aroung five days free use of it. Thank you Pin Traveler! RZED. | Good app | üëçüëçüëç | Unfortunately these ppl decided to take the hard way for the user to create all the places visited. Don't waste your time/ effort. | All I want is a simple map with pins. It's wants you to jump through hoops with signups and shoves pay for services right down your throat. Rubbish. | Best app | Wow | really good | Nice | Nice app | Very helpful app | This app is very usefull... love it.. | Woke do did did did right | nice app. it easily to use | Very good | Love thia app | good | App worked okay initially..still needs work on inputting data... the user interface is counterintuitive! Places you visit needed to be typed in rather than just selecting places on a map. After an hour of manually inputting places I have visited, it would not allow me to add more unless I purchased the ""Premium"" version or purchased any level.. There was so much potential as I had planned to explore it more prior to purchasing any level. Very frustrating So it's being uninstalled now Movin on! | It is good. | Good | üòÄüòÄüòÄ | Nice | Thank you sir | Very good app | Minneapolis st Paul and South st Paul and west st Paul | wow nice app | This is so good that I had to install it again on my new phone | Nice | Good app | This is great app. Very easy to set up. | This is what makes android smarter then iphone? | Woww great app!!keep it up!! | Must download it | The app works perfectly | Wonderful. Perfect app for Travellers ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Easy to use and have it installed on all 8 of my devices. | Its what puts the 'smart' in a smartphone. | I really love it | Very nice app excellent | Had this app for 3 phones, great app. | Nice app | It's amazing. Good thinking ü§î | I really miss this i like it | great app | I WILL LET U KNOW IWHEN I FIGURE THIS OUT | Great app i highly recommend it!! | Looks like there's a limit of 50 pins, before having to subscribe. Given that Google maps does similar for free, I'd only be prepared to pay a small one-off fee. Not subscribe. | Good | This is a nice app to reminisce on places that you have visited and think about places you want to go into the future. I would like to see an option on tracing, for example, a road trip you had done going from place to place just to look back on a trip you did. But thats just me! | I use it all the time. Great app I highly recommend. | App will not let me create an account. I enter my email, create a user name, and enter my full name...and nothing. There's no submit button, no next steps. No updates available. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. | Great way to keep track of all travels and adventures!

I booked mine and it got cancelled just few hours before the departure time because of which my whole plan was cancelled and I had to face many problems because of them. | Fake promises and also very cheap service pathetic | They have worst customer care system I have ever seen, they don't inform you of stop change and try to delay your cancellation so that after departure you cannot ask for refund.Even though I informed them 45 min prior to departure that I am waiting at the stop they told me to reach to next which was not possible due to time restriction and not initiating the refund even though they were at fault for not halting at pre decided stop giving technical reasons and not informing 1 hr prior | Could not find better deal | Very streamlined experience! | The app is great but the service ain't worth your time because they do not compensate you for anything or any troubles that can come from their end they don't care they will not compensate they don't even offer protection just in case something does come up they left me stranded in Las Vegas Nevada I used all the money I have in my last bus ticket to get home they could basically told me to kiss off and go screw myself they want compensate for nothing.... | Helpful | I booked a trip with this company only to be left stranded in plymouth it was only after another company rang them that i knew it was cancelled after they were rung they sent an email telling me find another form of transport 2nd class or a hotel at no more than 80 euros it was my first trip since losing my husband and i was so distraught and in tears very scared if it wasnt for the other company i would have been left alone and afraid i would never ever use this company again they are bad | Worst app on play store Bus didn't stop at destination They didn't even inform about the change in boarding station They are not even initiating refund | Bus left minutes before it was scheduled. After waiting for a couple of minutes, I found out the bus had left from a customer service rep and then they called it a no-show with no refund. First and discouraging experience. | It's like a soup, everyone taking the seats of everyone else, the driver doesn't care ""just sit anywhere "", don't pay for a seat reservation | When i booked for a return ticket i don't get my return. It happened twice to me, it made me spend so much on my travel and its so annoying. | Great. | Thank you for your kind support | Their buses are always very late. | Terrible experience ever! Less than 0 I hope to get my money back otherwise i will report them by police! From Amsterdam to Germany they stop us in a city without any information and they say us to get a train to get to the final destination. Abandoned to our destiny, we lose 5 hours of our holidays time... No words needed. Only S. t | excellent | *Indian region review never book with there service is not same as Germany or Europe countries bus arrives late or never arrive not refund no give f about you as consumer . | very good | Absolutely fantastic App in just couple of steps I got my ticket | good and easy | It only took one time riding flixbus to realize what a terrible bus it is. I am broken down at the side of the road on Easter Sunday as we speak. I missed my connection with no other buses leaving today and am now stranded for Easter, and am not with my family. The passengers are even worse than the lack of maintenance on the bus. My neighbor put her backpack, food items, and other belongings in my seat instead of in the empty overhead storage bin. Guy in devil horn hat blocked aisle with legs. | Good | I booked with flixbus from the app and they have no contact number to no office information to speak with in case u lost and u need help , when i arrive late drivers were very aggressive and un helpful, in the next station I arrived early 1 hour before bus journey in the station all driver's were un help full when I asked them for bus platform and I also lost the journey and i baid again to go back to Vienna in the last minute of the last journey of the day . . I don't advise to use this | good | good service | You pay for reserved seats and they are full. Everytime I have used it this happens. Refund request put in. | Worst Service | fast and convenient | fair | good | i like it | the bus is late and you cannot claim a refund | One of the worst experience, they never showed up to the pickup point. Waited for more than 3 hours, there is no customer care, contact information is not shared along with the booking details. Driver did not even call before starting. Horrible service, better avoid this nightmare. | great way to find cheapest bus tickets | I cancelled my trip. The app told me my trip is cancelled but won't give me a confirmation and didn't give any refund. Customer service didn't believe me even after showing a screenshot. | good working I love üíï | Stupid company no coustomer support they don't refund ur money even if they cancelled the booking | Lol, local operators with new logo, in NCR | Awesome service | The worst company bus arrived 1 hr before there were no messages and nothing The driver took off with no customer support | Fraud/scam call it whatever you want they made me wait for around 3 hours bus never arrived, been more than 2 months for now and yet no refund. Worst customer support acted like the cheery on the top Dont fall it | Nice job | The information provided is a lie. There is no leg room, outlets are NOT available. Not a good experience for what it costs. And lack of appropriate navigation when it comes to planning trips, in my opinion. | I am a flyer for 3 years I'm ready to take a break n tried the flix bus after tramatized on greyhound long trips I'm 55 but now I tried flix n I was glad for the peaceful ride for my thoughts but yeah but fix your chargers on the bus okkk would do 10 stars but f up won't stay in charger due to your sht fix it n I'd ride u forever quiet! but the bus is gud n clean us driver was kool | Very easy to navigate | comfortable ride and never a hassle | Bed experience | easy to do | cool | Awesome | Never on time. Keep delaying without any email. Bus came 1 hr late, it was raining still the driver didnt open the door. | Very bad Bus walo ko mobile number nhi share krte | Worst experience | I try to book my ticket but I can't put date expiry my credit card | The bus left more than 1 hour late. I was late for the plane. I couldn't understand the principle of choosing seats on the bus... | Great | Very poor service | customer service responses wrong to inquiry with delay, voucher link not working while customer service provides | I had to wait for more than 3 hours after the given time and there were no updates regarding the arrival of the bus. Very bad experience. | Makes the Megabus look 2nd rate. | App probably worse than the bus service and that's not great either. Once you buy tickets, if you don't save the QR code, its very hard to find. The ticket doesnt show up in the app. The search function does not work. I end up just doing a screenshot of the ticket. Which is fine but defeats the purpose of the app. Many passengers in NYC have issues with this, seen this many times. You should just be able to open the app and find the ticket. But this rarely works. Cheap service, cheap app. | Didn't provide water bottle and no provision to raise or interact with support team. | excellent | very good | Really sensitive dynamic prices alert . For example, you can't change the number of people or other stuff in the process, so you have to go back and then they increase the prices. Like, in a matter of one or two minutes. | Very very nice flixbus serves good very careful Stafü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | Overnight busses not suited for overnight travel. Drivers turning on salon lights at full brightness at every stop during night travel looks to be doing that on purpose to annoy passengers. Busses do not always arrive to the station, but stop somewhere around the corner. Terrible. P.S. in last 9 months 3 Flixbus busses crashed. At least 27 people dead. | the agent was very polite and patient | Absolutely avoid it. Pathetic experience. Bus kept showing in one location without moving for several hours. The chat support was absolutely unhelpful and unresponsive. Kept saying that there is a police issue and neither gave me any update on if the trip will still continue or be cancelled. We gave up after 2 hours of standing on the roadside and returned home. | Flix Bus Is The Best One | easy booking | Good | lots of options. very efficient | Sir, you should add optional stop on the way from which stop we would like to picup. | very bad maiden experience in India we booked sleeper bus but were given seater bus and we were not informed till we reached to board the bus. I can understand that there were technical problems but we should have been informed. I was travelling with someone with disability..and there is only the chat option to contact and the chat option is not very responsive | Easy to book and very affordable prices. | Would welcome to get more available connection shown | good and fast | I did at least 20 trips with flixbus and not even once I've been in time. Drivers stop randomly to eat, late or not. It's disappointing, they should be paid less. | best transport in England for students | I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration over a distressing incident during my recent journey with your company. On 24/03/2024, while traveling from Cambridge to London Victoria, I entrusted my bag to the Outside Luggage compartment. However, upon reaching Victoria Station, my bag was missing. Upon inquiry, the driver admitted to leaving my bag outside at the previous stop, Finchley Road. This negligence is deeply concerning and reflects poorly on your company's commitment.üò†üò† | Customer service is nonexistent | Very flexible service and fast. I am fully üòå satisfied. | Very bad service doesn't give money back when you cancel your journey | I want aware you all guys don't book any trip from flixbus if you got any emergency and you couldn't travel they would refund it to you any pence. They are playing a game they also charged you cancellation fees and they gave you voucher that mean they keep the whole money which you already paid to them. They are not considering the customer issues. I would prefer to you travel through any other coach services. | geed like | üëç | very confusing with am and pm hours! horrible idea to modify how the hours are displayed. for example, if you reserve a bus 1h20 pm, make sure you see 1h20 pm and not 1h20 am | Price jump for same day travel is egregious | gut | absolutely good | After 10 minutes the driver stopped for a lunch break for around 10-15 minutes before getting on the motorway in Hungray. With a bus full of people, and everyone got angry. Also, they said there will be free available wifi, but it doesn't dven exist. And there is no option to stop somewhere to drop you off earlier, only on the town's other part, and yet, he was embarrassed by it, which is incredibly rude. I must pay the same amount for a taxi, just like I did for the bus to drop meoff whereIwant | super! | Worst bus services. 1. You'll not get any bus operator contact details. 2.your boarding and dropping points will automatically change by flix bus. 3.Bus will not stop at the points shown on route map, It's hmjust there for reference 4.If you've not boarded, they don't bother even,will not even ask before departure 5.Customer Support is worsr. Not at all recommdabe. | they change or cancel buses short period of anticipation, and the app falls to notify. also got more than one problems with my reserved seats. | best service i reccomend it for travelling | They introduced fees for using the app every time to buy a ticket. I think that should be part of the service, not an extra. Can't book seats after buying tickets. No seat reservation even after buying tickets for two person. Frequent cancellation of journey just before the departure time. Price is much higher. I feel Flixbus is getting worse. | Great app! | easy to use. great price | Horrible Experience, Staff's behavior was very discourteous. I'm a frequent bus travel and experience of this bus service was very bad. Staff doesn't care about passenger. There is no proper customer care mechanism. I'm never going to travel in this bus service. üò°ü§¨ | This bus service made me trouble a lot...they shifted my booking a day after what I booked without any intimation. | works what it should. | Terrible service. | very reliable service. A+!!! | not being on time | it good | Please switch to 24 hour clock, it would be easier for user in booking tickets as we are used to 24 hour clock rather than 12 hour. | I was looking to leave a complaint about my trip with flixbus today, but the app doesn't have a section for that and to demand a refund. The driver was late. He was rude. I asked him about wifi and he told me there was no wifi even though flixbus states their busses have wifi. I'm not sure if he was trying to make up for being late or if he's just reckless but the driver sped, tailgated and swerved causing cars to honk at him. It was a very stressful trip and I will never use flixbus again. | has restroom on bus | Frustrating app, website, and customer service, and the bus rides aren't good either. The busses have drop down TV's which play movies, where the volume is played distressingly loud throughout the whole bus even if your TV isn't dropped down. I wish that had been mentioned anywhere on the site or app, I wouldn't have purchased a ticket with them if I'd known. | nice hasle free service | This company doesn't take accountability. Don't ride with them. I booked a trip to Orlando from Tampa. It came up 110.95. Their driver arrived 2 hours late. The bus needed repairs. However, they're telling passengers that they won't be receiving refunds at all. Some people missed transportation connections to go out of the destination city. They will be stranded. Some people missed important meetings. Others had important plans that got delayed. Taking an Uber would've been cheaper and faster. | Disgasting | It's a feedback for the company not the app. 2 trips out of 2 had 35min up to 3 hours late. No soup, no toilet paper, no WiFi working. The bus either burnt me as it was as hot or cold as fridge (sitting in my jacket and double socks, freezing). Why can't it just work out a proper way? | worst | Worst service ever. I booked a single seat as female passenger who is traveling alone, and this stupid bus service gave me another seat with a male passenger. Worst experience. Won't ever prefer. | Worst service. They can't provide a contact number of driver. I am waiting 2 hours of bus then returned to a home & no customer support no contact such a useless service when you visit flix website they also not provide resolutions. Other buses service's are much better like intercity,etc. Like what you think guys you are not provide any no and can't provide a particular location then how can a person find a bus. If you can't provide proper service then close your useless bus service and app. | it's good, but doesn't keep details to use again, unless you are an agent | Bad application no booking pls and time par time change and ticket cancel | Started charging service fee (1 euro), because there's no limit to their greed, and they can do this since through price dumping they destroyed any local competition they had. I'll avoid travelling with Flixbus whenever I have other option. | reasonable prices but rarely on time due to rush hour schedules. Flixbus shows inflexibility on adjusting to more fluid travel times (earlier departures...) | today my friend going Lisbon to leiria he had two bag one hand bag other big lugguge ,,,he reached leiria without bag ,,,he had kept both the bags in the bus,,,there was also a blanket,,,,but he was not there he asked the bus driver the bus driver said you complain online ,,No one is listening online bus number 76XE27 FlIX Bus I am booking online ,,please all people carefull | Great service. | very friendly | One of the worst treatment from bus drivers, they just have really bad attitude. Not mentioning that everytime I get 2 hours delay, i booked flixbus 4 times, and each time it just get worse. | Does not give any different prices from the general coach and bus websites. Very misleading and actually works out more expensive on some journeys. | Wrost app nd bus service no helpline number service is poor | great price | Good bus service | no response on feedback or complaints | App dhang se bana le pehle , location show nahi karta | i like it | They changed my boarding station a day before the trip. That would be okay. But they changed my seat and gave me a back seat. I opted a window seat and got it reserved. Still they changed it at the last moment so that I had no option but to follow the bus. Nat satisfied. | bus is clean friendly smooth ride. | tricky info app with no Feedback to notify developers on huge disinformative results screens that randomly hide essential means of any travel planning! As have no space for more here...one only sample : after notorious direct route settled and then toggle set my favourite way to travel FlixTrain as I will always prefere, I only first time got fair (train) results ! Unexpectedly while browsing other days, the by bus/train selection top line dissapeared and you get bus only results ANY days! | Sucked, BIG TIME!!! | easy to get the ticket but a little hard to find the pick up spot | Great bus services and reliable | good | Good application with all the information real time. | Good helpful | It's not showing any exact location..waste of time | Not helpful in any sort of giving you the right time and place and even I payed for my tickets the Bus never showed and no alternative solution just to take a other bus or train company | I needed to make a connection and I bought a ticket. The bus was late by an hour and a half and I had to choose alternative means of transport. They refused to issue me a refund for a service they were unable to provide. I don't recommend it. I'll not be using their ""service again"" | OK app | Good service üíØ | cool cool | Excellent experience no one can beat this bus service all over in india | Good services and good support! | I had left my e-reader on the back of the seat, contacted flixbus right away when the bus left, but they ""could not contact the driver,"" and i had to ""leave an email for flixbus and they would get back to me."" I chased the bus down to the final destination, the e-reader was not there anymore, and I wasted a whole day on my vacation. On another occasion, the bus left early! from the departing bus stop, they said they would cover my hotel for the next day, then consequently refused when emailed. | very bad | 20 times i have to say no thanks to notifications in an reappearing ANNOYING pop up. WILL YOU please STOP BOTHERING ME !! | love it | great | You can book bus rides with flix bus and its partners. Nothing to criticise about the App. | it's quite easy to go by | Am I the only 1 person who is using this app on Android ? You have not noticed that you can't change the departure day by day and the arrival, the return always day by day to check which bus fits best to you depending on the prices, all transfers and time for the whole way and back ???? I have never seen such messy app for a booking place in a bus... | All fake news | good | Es nervt das ihr mir so oft meinen Reservierten Sitzpl√§tze Storniert und ich woanders sitzen muss wo ich eigentlich nicht m√∂chte und erstrecht nicht wo leute rein und raus gehen. üò° | Bak was | Supa | Very poor when it comes departing/arriving. You need to have a strict designated depot. Arrived 45 minutes beforehand to the map location in Brussels, only to discover that it was a sleepover bay for the drivers, it was only because one of the drivers told me this - just as well that the Amsterdam (810) was running late. If you can have a designed depot in Paris, you can have one anywhere else in Europe. Other than that, I've enjoyed my comfort trips with Flixbus. | Very good service | so easy to book | faulty almost made me kill myself | Everyone is there but no one has called before leaving the bus. Like yesterday, my ticket was from Delhi to Lucknow but it reached my address. But according to the address there is no bus there. Man, if any traveler has come to you, you should at least send an SMS or call. Customer support is of no importance. I even sent a mail to cancel the ticket but there was no reply. The biggest reason is that he has not even given any number.

I am so happy. | Great app easy to use. | Great service | Very good very nicee, very nice very goood | I am having trouble with the app since using Android 14. It doesn't load. I can't see any flight information, have booking ability or use my boarding passes. | Ok. Reasonably intuitive. You know at each stage that they will be trying to get you to pay for something else. | Perfect | Fly from Munich as well an option | Brilliant | Thank you | All works well | Great | Already operating the new jewell: the MAX. Should I had known ... | Excellent app and simple to use | Good | Does what it says on the tin. Takes you from A to B with no frills. The App is clear and functional. One of the best on the market. | Has about a 2% chance of actually opening | Easy | App should not localize flight times when viewing boarding passes. This leads to seeing multiple times for the flight if you are in a different time zone | Excellent and affordable | Very simple and easy to use | Easy to use | Easy to use | This company is a scam. When I arrived to the airport I found out that they close the online-check-in 2 hours prior the flight, then they charged me 55‚Ç¨ for the check-in there. Shame on you. | Great | Easy to use | I have used Ryanair fairly often, for years, and always use the app, but since the last update last week, it doesn't work. Can't buy a ticket, as the home page is blank, tried to add a booking, and it doesn't work. I tried uninstall and then re instated it, but still, the same issues remains. | Very easy and convenient. love it! | App works well | Fast and effective. | Really good app for managing bookings but the problem is that i cant order food if i dont update app | I have flown Ryanair many times before and never had an issue. Thank you Ryanair. | Super easy | Great and so easy to use, | Offering changes to taken outbound flight? | Very easy to use | Not a bad app to be honest | Easy to use and a stress free service | Easy to use. | The app doesn't allow camera focus meaning all images are glared,impossible to contact via chat | Was going to check in to my flight and it requested that I pay again the baggage fees I had already paid when I bought my ticket. So I decided to not check in and do that at the airport, because of that had to pay 110‚Ç¨ fee just because the check in wasnt online. Every bit of money you save on the ticket they will steal from you somehow. Do not fly Ryan Air | Easy to use | We are first timers on this Ryanair Application and so far everything is easy and clearly explained. | Very good to use üëç | Easy to use | The application sends notification: gate info is available. 1. It doesn't show it in the push itself, wth 2. Actually, the gate info isn't available yet. | Trash | Convinient | Too many additional extra fees! | Excellent service | Easy and quick check in process | This review is more about the booking experience with RyanAir as opposed to their app. I find their constant suggestions to spend more money (typically at the risk of incurring large fines if you don't choose the right option) very annoying and stressful. | Works great | Very easy to use. | Just as badly as Ryanair wants a 5 star rating from me, I wish the money I pay for the fares would go towards paying for competent developers who know how to build robust platforms. But alas, here we are, with Ryanair making its contribution to make this world we live in just a little bit worse every single day. | Brilliantly easy to use ! | Unavailable creat an account! | Verygood | Keep up the good work.... üòä | Superb | Good work | Can't finish transaction with 3 different bank cards | Easy to use | Great service | Always a good experience flying from Newquay. | Best way to check in, book flights everything. | It's extremely annoying to make me install an app just to get a mobile boarding pass | Easy and straightforward | App kept crashing and couldn't check-in, had to pay check-in at the airport (equivalent to 55‚Ç¨ per person) and they will not refund me despite the crashing app. I was happily flying ryanair again after nearly many years following a bad experience but I believe this was my definite last flight with crooks airlines. | Don't book your parking via the app. There's no way to find what you booked let alone to modify it in the Ryanair app (I didn't even seem to receive a confirmation email). Just book directly with the parking provider. | Poor app that only work for selling useless services... | Easy to use. | this used to be good | Easy to use | Easy to use | very frustrating and expensive method of changing (supposedly ""free"") flights. | Horrible greedy company | Very easy | Easy to follow | Fantastic app, easy to get things done üëç | Good | Very easy to navigate and complete booking. | Exceptional | 2024 and it works great üëç easy to use and everything u need in one place | It's pretty user friendly. | Asking for touch personal information just to look at prices, happy to give information if booking but not before | So it is sending promotional spam notifications 3 times a week, but when a gate changes it doesn't do anything?!? | The app should inform that online checkin is mandatory , so that the airline doesn't charge for printing a boarding pass at the airport. | Just pay a bit more for a better airline, the staff are very rude both in client suport and check in services at the airport as well as in the airplane (which I dont completely blame them they are probably underpaid) the system is so bad both app and website. Careful with check in times, every centimeter and miligram on the bags, they will make you pay more for a slight difference, everything they can to take more money. Very often flight is delayed. It lives up to its name as the worst airline. | Good | Terrible app, difficult to use and couldn't choose one seat and randomly allocate one seat | as of now, i love this apps, | Very useful and user friendly | It's refusing to provide the previous bookings. That's a outrageous and Ryanair is also not caring to reply through emails. No matter how much time you send them a message. | I couldn't find a lot of useful info on the app which lead to unxcpected payments! | Easy convenient and no printing | Excellent service üëè | good | no complaints about this mobile app. I have used Wizz, BA, easyjet, Vueling, Lufthansa but none of their apps come even close to this one. Ryanair has never disappointed me. it's the most reliable low-cost airline. | Easier than I thought... 5üåü | One of the worst trip to morrocco they do not assist users at all Helpfulness is zero and no interest to check the incompetence of their staff in morrocco who are experts in blackmailing passengers of last minutes by charging them unfairly and breach their own policies no witness no customer service | Great | Easy to handle.

Utterly disappointed. | very nice | good | The app is taking Convienence fees as to cause inconveniences to customers. Worst customer support despite too many calls and mails. No designated number for customer support from the app. Worst experience i have ever faced | Good | Super | Best for Best booking | I don't recommend Trip Guarantee to anyone who book tickets from this app. Bcs in all scenarios lose of money will be customer only. Ye Platform use na hi karo to behatar hoga. Agar nhi trust hai to Ek baar Inka guidelines padh lena book karne se pahle Samjh aa jayega ki, kyu isse ticket book nhi karna, Aur trip guarantee ka jo 2x money hai o coupon me milta hai jo 8 days ka validity hota hai but O tum same hi route pe use kar sakte ho In simple words, use some other platforms except this. | Just too good | Excellent | Prices r Unreliable | ok | Excellent | very good | Service is very pathetic. They do not even connect to customer care person to tell them my issues. Done two bookings last 5 days back 1. The bus booked was showing the wrong timings due to which the bus was booked of earlier night instead of next night, they did not even shifted to next day even after requesting, neither they refunded the amount 2. The hotel booked was very unclean, poor service, and MMT took more 1.5 times more charges than their onspot booking. | Never trust this app's policy. They only makes you fool with their lucrative policies. I have book tickets under trip guarantee where they make sure you for 3X refund but they will give you only voucher not exactly refund... refund means money back . Coustomer never get advantages from this kind of app. Please choose a good website to not become fool like me MakeMyTrip you are worst app | It's impossible to reach your team to discuss about the bookings and the call i received from your risk management team. But let me post here, Mr. Sudhir Gupta, he was so rude as if i have committed some crime by letting my friend book the property.

Even vehicle having breakdown issue how they know before 20 days.. even they don't have other replacement vehicles. | poor rather fraud customer support in case you experience any hardship post booking and incase booking and check in goes smooth the customer support would not be needed so in nutshell no customer support | The price is showing different 592 before booking and the price is showing different 673 when reaching to payment mode which is not fair Soo many hidden charges after even applying discount coupon please fix it | Very worst app, no one is responded, the refund policy is very bad. Finally they will not refund the amount. | Good one | My trip section doesn't work | Excellent | üëå | Due to unnecessary distractions on the app, I inadvertently booked different date and route, and had to cancell the tickets and lost Rs more than 11 thousand, without even travelling. | good Service | Awesome. Makes life easier when it comes to booking flight or hotel. Thanks MMT | Good | payment option bit complicated | good service | Poor quality bus operater not listening MakeMyTrip | Excellent üëåüèæ | Cheapest and reliable üòÑ | Please refund my amount first if u r not able to give confirm ticket why u charge so much and then u give loss to custmers plz dnt do these every penny is worth to someoneüëé | good | 100% satisfaction | Cheaters, I recently had a booking, and unfortunately, it was canceled. According to the Trip Guarante, I was supposed to receive 3X. I was misguided by their customer service. They even said they don‚Äôt record calls with customers, so they can‚Äôt find any call recording, whereas we have proof of talking with them in their official customer support, and we even have mail. But they were rude and really unhelpful and cheated on a loyal customer like me,god help new once. | Good | Didn't loading the irtc page at last and not giving refund | Good | Worst app for booking it has zero customer support i have cancelled my ticket and the app shows refund is successful but i still not got my money..shame on you MakeMyTrip | one of the best application i ever used | Very good | Good | Please Alia and Ranveer ki ads better banao.... | Bilkul bekar app ha muje abhi tak refund nhi mila 1 month ho gya .. please don't use this app | nice | good | Fraud in the name of trip guarantee. Lots of terms and condition so that u can never use the trip guarantee voucher anyhow. And it's not at all 3X refund in my booking I have paid 3200 for train ticket and 1500 for trip guarantee total 4500 the total refund I got is 9000 which is not at all 3X. In this deal I lose 200 for ticket cancellation 1500 for trip gaurantee and all 6000 of there so called refund voucher bcoz of there 100 fot terms and condition I can't use the amount total fraud. | To book the ticket it is Extremely good Application | Good | Great app for booking accommodation.

No refund policy üëéüèæ I had to pay for the room twice. Completely dissatisfied with this app. Will never use again. | 3rufulll8up ikk77 | Cannot find my booking to see how much it will cost.I usually use a PC so I find the app difficult to navigate. | Book to room and when I got to the hotel, they said they didn't have any rooms so out in the cold without a bed. $125 to sleep in my car. | Awesome app. Easy to use. Simple process | problems checking in from latest reservations. | I wish I could give negative starts for this app. The app won't let me enter in a location where I want to search. I click on going to and it gives me the going to page. I type in where I want to go. Nothing populates and I cannot hit enter. | Loved it before they changed how you earn a free room. You have to book almost twice as many nights to get what amounts to a free room. | Rewards program was gutted, now it sucks. Used to love getting gold status and the perks associated. Now much harder and way more diluted. Guess will switch to hotel specific programs or another app. | Rubbish site. Nowhere to state dog friendly | Room was very clean and super nice. | It's so easy and convenient! | great app | Great places prices and overall experiences. | Latest ap update has been installed today and now the sign in button does not work on any screen. Why did you not check the update before releasing it? | I haven't been happy since the rollout of the new rewards program. It's a joke. However, I kept using the app because it's what I'm used to. After yesterday, never again. I tried booking a room and received an error message. It never sent me a confirmation but charged my card three times. Contacting customer service was a joke. After getting nowhere I hung up and contacted the credit card company. I then went directly to the hotels website and actually got a cheaper price. Booker beware. | customer service is top tier when needing adjustments or other arrangements! | I have an account but i cant put in my password. Iv got to come out of your site to get a 6digit code in an email.pointless | Horrible will not let me sign in | Would love a room in the first floor. Walking distance to the mall and water park and meat market. Other than that I'd give it a 7.5. our bathroom sink is clogged up to the one to shower your hands. The finaly we need a comfotabl cot to sleep on please Ok | ok so i think jokerstwistedwife only fans account should have support by ever single owner if the hotel. except for La Quinta La Quinta stole her gamer computer what s very creepy search jahnay Mcgowen laquinta on YouTube | This non-techie senior wanted more specific searches. I.e. near Little Caesar's Arena, not just downtown Detroit... | good way to find a hotel | have been using for a few years and it is an easy to use app and the customer support has been exceptional | I have used it for a couple of years now. I always compare rates with other platforms and I always find great deals here. :) | Trash app keeps identifying me as a robot no matter how many times I pass the verification process | App is unusable. Hard to login. Once logged in, I can't view any of my information. | Best App | Always an easy experience! | Sucks | The What's New still does not include any useful text.................... | Missing send message to hotel option, only phone number available. Complicated overview of reservations in random trip boxes versus simple list view. Not showing in receipt view if reservation is paid already. No easy access to price guarantee option. | good rates, but weird sorting | The app never shows any trip details properly after booking, there is always error after booking and also for rewards | great service | Always lots of options and very easy to browse and book. | I like to get room cheaper price | Very easy, informative and has never let me down.. | Rip off | too hard to sign in. not worth the time of day | Stupid app switches to thai for booking change, no english option | Pretty terrible app. Try to book online instead. | never fails to have the best deals | Locks up, crashes, won't recognize my email | The app has become very glitchy over the past three weeks | Always great. Always the best price. Love the rewards scheme.. | The app has to improve their trip session. Cannot access to booked hotel. | the thing u like the most about this app is that i get 1 night free for everybq0 nights i book ... i got so far so many free nights ... but sometimes the room price is more expensive than other app, for that i use this app | Great site that has lots of choice and is easy to use | great app. saves me so time. | cannot make changes or edits to your account. | haven't stayed yet | You don't save more money if you download the ap. It offered me a deal and didn't honor it. Ap worked fine though. | easy to use! | always plenty of places to choose from with good prices | I liked the rewards program better before the change. Now we don't get as much. | I won't be using this site anymore as the cookie settings prevent me from maintaining my privacy, especially with advertising in mind. If I cannot opt out I don't want to spend my money with a company such as this. I will choose this option until the internet is a free space again and my details aren't auctioned to the highest bidder. | great easy to use | So convenient | Hotels.co. makes it really easy to make a reservation. The only issue I have with them is the new rewards system.... it seems that the rewards program has really taken away the full impact of the reward. | easy and fast | Easy to book stays. | It doesn't work abroad. You sign in and it can't find your trips. That's what it's supposed to do. That's its job. | It used to be great, now it's unusable. | it's the best | funciona bem | Terrible app. Everyone I try to view my reservation the app gets crazy. Which is extremely inconvenient. I'll probably never going to use it again | good site | They are cheating, after i got 10 nights , they refused to let me use the reward night tell me that i have to wait 2 months to use , and then it is only for limited time . They never mentioned that when u book with them . Don't use it | Currency cannot be changed on the fly to match payment method. Somehow you have to sign out and in again and after selecting the currency you want, the language changes and you cannot apply points to offset final amount. Points are tied to the country you select and I cannot help but assume there is some bias against certain countries. On top of that, it does not recognise certain cards even though the cards were accepted by airlines and other more esteemed companies. | The only hotel booking site I use! Love it!!! | for the first time ever I'd make a reservation just hope everything goes as I'd expect | great prices | I need a financial assistance for the new car and ins | They keep changing their terms and conditions to confuse customers and steal the rewards they earned. Stay far away. | It's a good site to get | Sometimes a bit clunky but works well 90% of the time. | good app | The deals increase as you continue to make reservations. | Wont even let us sign in | simply, informative and straight to the point | love the prices | so far it's Good üëçüèΩüòä!! God has My children's mother!! | Login doesn't work | Sorry to say, but don't use Hotels for bookings. Customer service is ok but reservation department is hopeless. Had a pathetic experience. If hotel fellow denies you for entry, asking some extra bugs then these guys don't have clue what to do. They will keep you waiting hours on call till you get frustrated. Finally you have to loose your money and most importantly precious time. | The hotel is super clean and the rooms are spacious with a fridge and microwave. Free breakfast was very nice, as well. The pool area was a disappointment, tho. There is only a small catch pool for the slides and nowhere to just swim. They require you to reserve a time to swim to prevent overcrowding, which is nice. This is a great place if you are traveling with small children, but if you are like me and have a teenager the rambunctiousness of SO many small kids might be annoying for you. | much better than versi√≥n... still filter for free parking seems dissappear from the stage, and the previous app versi√≥n had a quicker hotels info and data access for end user, me. since I'm here, one more, invoices format is a joke? | right when I need them.... prices and locations | I cant see my upcoming reservation to cancel it | It is a convenient app, but the switch to key cash was a real downgrade for us customers. | Wonderful service I've was able to make reservations Stress free.

User friendly app. | Very easy to use | the accomodation was very poor. No clean towels or bedclothes.

Also, I live in Turkey but I'm a foreigner and I would prefer app in English or Russian. I can easily change app to English but then i have to change country. If possible, i would like to be able to change app language without changing country"",""Currency cannot be changed on the fly to match payment method. Somehow you have to sign out and in again and after selecting the currency you want, the language changes and you cannot apply points to offset final amount. Points are tied to the country you select and I cannot help but assume there is some bias against certain countries. On top of that, it does not recognise certain cards even though the cards were accepted by airlines and other more esteemed companies."",""This app used to be wonderful but the changes they have made are just terrible! I hate that they removed the \""free parking\"" filter and the new layout isnt nearly as visually pleasing. The reviews are harder to read and i dont need the map taking up half the space on the page. I have no idea why companies feel the need to change things that aren't broken! Very disappointing! Edit 2/19/2024: dropping score. The changes mentioned by the support staff are even worse!"",""Be careful of this app! I have to reset my filters very often, even if I am only enlarging the search area. This is annoying, but even moreso because one of my filters is \""reserve now, pay later\"". I like that this AI somehow works more often when searching for two rooms, each with one person. The competition's search rarely works with that request but this one does. If only it kept the filters in place! Can't recommend this app until it's fixed.""]",false,false,false,"com.hcom.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hcom.android&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Ordered a ticket, no news about it even after confidently committed ticket will be issued within certain time. Chased for more than 12 hours.. Finally got it.. But excuses comes on fast on explanation when I wanted a response from them why such a thing can happened. Don't waste time,saving 10 dollars or so against the risk taken.. Not worth it. | Very bad it take more than 2 days to issue my ticket and in the end as me to cancel and except refund even refund it take 4 days to give me back my money.customer service very bad not help at all When I'm writing now another ticket delay to issue also now more than one day is really very bad . | Best app for China. However, recently I've noticed that many of the budget range hotels in China, say they'll take any nationality, but when you ask them, they actually only take Chinese. This is terrible as the passport details need to be recorded and Mainland China Only hotels don't have a facility for this. I have booked, and have been turned away in the past. PLEASE CORRECT THIS!!! Train tickets in China are more expensive on Trip, but it works well. | Verygood employee and very accommodating | much affordable and convenient to book. | very quick response and wonderful coordination. | Repeatedly changes flights to insane times (most recently, 10pm arrival moved to 3am) and blames airlines, when original flight on the airlines website has multiple, cheaper tickets. Will not refund. Something shady going on with this company. Avoid at all costs. Been using them for years but never again. Birn me once, shame on you. Burn me two or three or, now four times? Shame me. | I loved it. Because of agency always answers on time. Superb | yas | No Information about the Visa process and visa requirements. No help in getting UAE visa. It resulted in just chaos and i had no visa. I have to pay 300 euros just to get UAE visa on my own. Unreliable fraudulent company. | I have been a C-trip customer for over a decade. Back then they didn't have so many duplicitous add-ons masquerading as a regular service. As we all know, airlines charge for seats now and I thought I was doing just that via Trip. I went to manage my flight via the airline, only to find out they had charged me for free seats and cheap seats. It's like being missold PPI. It's fraudulent sales made legal. Use their flight+hotel feature very carefully, it's also dishonest. Their response is a lie. | üëç | Very useful app. | very convenient for paying method | very good | Worst | Super easy to use! | very good | Super easy to use and the flights are heavily discounted! Highly recommend üëå | worst company they over booked my flight advised me four hours before departure. Now they will not refund my ticket. Do your self a favor book flights directly with airline companies. | Simply a fantastic app. My only choice when booking flights. Also now using too book accommodation. A 10 out of 10 app. | Bad service not much discount | I booked spa tickets for myself and my 2 kids. Finally they canceled my kids' tickets (as kids are not allowed to book tickets separately from adults). Funny thing that in this app I can't book a few tickets together. It's just freaking awful, I'm super disappointed with the service and will stop using it again. | I had good impressions until I ran into problems. For example they promise free cancellations but they keep your money for 7 days. They said they issue a refund but they don't, so they charge you. Also sometimes the prices are incorrect and misleading ly do not include taxes. Occasionally good deals but I will go back to booking. Booking doesn't take your money and then refund you 7 days later when they see fit. I use Revolut so if a refund was issued, it would have been received immediately | Very bad experiance to book entertaining with it | I need to change a name for my booking because i made a mistake in clicking info. But you never help me!!!!!!!!!! You don't find a way to do it!!!!!! One chance is all im asking for!!!! No room for mistake???? | The customer service representative was very helpful and resolved all the queries I had. | cheaper than others | great services | App had already saved my details so I just found the ideal deal and paid, very easy | nice website | Excellent site for booking flights & hotels. Much cheaper too | Good and great value | User friendly specially for an oldie like me ü§£ü§£ü§£ | Good aps | ok | Cheaper here than other app/sites. | Great way to book a trip anywhere! | amazing | Very user friendly when booking | great performance | good | good service | rodel andilum | nice | There trip points are quite useful | Be careful. They are who buy your ticket under your name with their bank account after you transfer the money. It means that when you claim anything, the money will go to their account, and they will not return the money to you. | Took my money and said payment had failed | Nice app, I recommend it to anyone who wants to save a few dollars. | poop | very affordable to buy tickets | This app help us if we travel like something if you need to look schedule for your trip you can book schedule here. This is nice one. | Title: The Trap App: A Comprehensive Review Introduction: In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile applications, the term ""trap app"" has emerged to describe a unique category of software designed to captivate users with addictive features, often leading to excessive usage and potential negative consequences. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of trap apps, examining their characteristics, impact on users, ethical considerations, and potential solutions. | I have paid by QR code scanning. The transaction is canceled and refunded but money does not return to me. | Legit flight booking | Really easy to use. Their contact centre & chatbot are also efficient & helpful. | they booked me on a $1200 international flight that had NO FOOD, NO DRINK, NO BEER, NO INFLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT, NO USB PORT, 10 HOURS, offered me $46, and then STUFFED ME AROUND FOR 2 WEEKS hastle me out with 46 emails BEFORE THEY ISSUED THE REFUND. KEEP AWAY | good | About payment method cannot | I think this app is the easiest to use among the others especially for first timers like me. üòä | good job | the best Ever ü§© | Fast booking onlineüëçüëçüëç | very useful and works really well | Easy to use. Booking and refund processes are straight forward. | This is my 1st time booking from trip. And seems like a very bad experience I have encountered. After make payment, fault many times until when succeeded payment. It send an email to me that they refund to me due to failed payment on the transaction. What the heck are you really doing here. Prank me? And your customer service told me the payment will refund to me 10 days. Don't you think you got to improved on this? Such a disappointment. | great service. and always able to help. | Horrible service once you buy a flight ticket through them you're on you own. I had a problem with the name spelling,contacted them to fix it (something that is supposed to be a simple fix) they made me wait 2 weeks to send me an email requesting me to purchase a new ticket in the new price and pay $100 fee on top of that only to refund me the original ticket and they claim it's the airlines policy. I ended up contacting the airlines directly and fixed it easily. Screw them they're a scam | great tools for booking and travelling | I love it | excellent | easy and more deals | If your flight costs more than 50 pounds don't use them. In case of any airline cancellations you're on your own even if they say that they'll provide you a solution. Your entire trip will go down the drain if you book with them. I recommend booking with them if you enjoy mental torture. They are experts at providing you with just enough to not fix anything but pretend to do something until it's too late. | Do not understand ,how the coins worth 1.33 used for the booking yet the final price charged to my credit card is without the deduction of 1.33 so coins used but not reduction. | 1st time using this site ,easy to use | all are here | how to contact you guys...pls advise | good price and good location | Very clean | This is very Good app. I frequently used this app only whenever I want to Travel or book hotel. I recommend this to everyone who is searching for one the Exciting deals | they do the job | Be VERY careful when booking flights. Especially if you have a layover, as Trip & the airline can void your ticket (giving you a much later flight). Either I accept a 25 hour layover or pay extra, almost HALF of my original ticket price. They know when rates go up and will make sure you pay the difference, even if you already booked and paid. Beware. | Good to find flights | Good service | Terrible ,chat bots no good answer phone useless | Super bad experience! Wasted my money on this app! I booked a round trip and I couldn't board the return trip. Had to buy another ticket at the train station and pay double. | trusted and reliable | very good apps | I recommend this for everybody | easy to track flights and convenient to use. | This application is very good, reliable and fast in confirming booking. Excellent. | I love all the trains except the transpennies express. It was the worst train ever and the experience was the worst. Not only did they not help me when I got stuck because of bad signal they threatened me to call police if I don't show rail card and also they said I've wasted his time. Like what can I do. They didn't help but instead taking really bad at me. I've never sat on such a rude train in my life. | GREAT PRICING... Seamless using app. thank you | The account is freezing and not loading once you try to get further details. | awesome | very good application | Good app | I need advise. I booked yesterday but I don't have a gcash. I was directed to the apps but can't get thru, until I got a message my booking was cancelled due to long wait. There where option payments, but I don't have any of those, is there a possibility I could book cheap rates using gcash but paying through 7/11. I'm already se√±or citizen, not techky. Looking forward for your reply and assistance you could extend. Thank you very much! | Good choice | feel good | hotels are expensier than booking dot com | Edit: After so much back and forth, the first line agent refunded the tickets. STILL be cautious of booking trips in advance because if your flight changes or cancels by airline, you're hooked to fight for your refund. | worse than i can imagine | easy scrolling, user friendly, easy to order, hassle free payment. | So very nice and useful | Best apps for traveling | satisfied booking | fantastic | ok | Reliable. Cheaper rate than other websites | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Booking trips from here is very unreliable ..what the hell U guys mean my flight details have changed are U going to pay for my accommodation and other expenses | helpful | My go-to app for my travel needs! | very good | User-friendly app for trips booking | Very buggy and don't seem to be able to see Railcard when no signal | Good booking app | good service | Scam! Slaps you with an auto renewal of 60‚Ç¨ and it's impossible to cancel! It's a scam! | I dont know yet | app just stopped working properly. now when i click on a tour to see its details, i get a blank white screen. | Excellent hotel. Great value for money. Room was very clean. Very comfortable bed. Great bathroom and shower. Reception staff were very helpful. Good breakfast. Great location. Less than a 5 minute walk from both East Nanjing Road and Peoples square metro stations. Great stay. | I managed to get reasonable price for air tickets. | My goto online travel booking website for more than 20 years. Customer Service has always been excellent helping out in a few situations I had with some hotels. Highly reliable! Total ease of mind in using them. | Trustworthy app. Like it for all my travel needs | awesome | Good service | a great service | Nice | good app | cheapest price on the hotel | They dont reply u. Just mia. Edit: they replied and lied in your face. And scam u. Just delete the app pls. Edit: the email address given is a scam. Just to cheat you. Very shady | Not showing actual price when select the date or flight thay up the price. | Stole my money (took payment but no railcard to be found) More expensive than Trainline for the same journey Messy homepage, looks like a pile of adverts with no logic. | Had a really good offer for Railcards but I refuse to have to navigate through a million obnoxious offers and poorly designed UI everytime I want to get to my Railcard as you refuse to let us export it to Google Wallet. I also refuse to use the horrible interface and buy my tickets through the app so I guess no custom for you and cancelled my Railcard. Very disappointed you have just taken the ¬£46 and ran with it but I guess not | gpa pupolar app | good | Very useful app. Sometimes the prices are lower than original websites. | Good apps | has better deals | üéà‚ù§Ô∏èüíó | Responsive and Fast. A lot of adverts though, slightly cluttered UI. | Payment cutting was done twice at the time of online ticket purchase. it was a very bad experience | good trip with ttipüòä | nice","{""1"":21446,""2"":2680,""3"":13404,""4"":45573,""5"":225188}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Trip.com","Trip.com","app@trip.com","https://www.trip.com/","72 Anson Road, #12-01 Anson House, Singapore (079911),  Singapore","https://pages.trip.com/service-guideline/privacy-policy-en-us.html","Trip.com","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XP13OLtNtCincmIUiQmuHUhoq1RwkCaN9uV9zafCOhXrxFSTMPLTUpChh3P9yfbGBg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8IwC-1TeO4Z9mgW6qb_-Lznj8s11Jb_wvgNFqhhQbxhAtlBsgmklrkYJVTtn7ow_Wg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/C1zwb5Ha4Dw5jnhSqbZArk8YdKn7WvSDURwd0iSxBZZQu0c28YmIkhc4bbFFsXyo4tQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FeHt1ytZirZUDwVIhEtoCCqLkwYi9M-dUun8kx3_rfy7Ca5rjI115MqFt4e8XvpqEQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VmuzUx04a0NsceID3ttSKsLXUBH-G9bPECVFxS-8PIiiryeb26WFFoVJk2YnARfuiygg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/k88QUC8cynmJE5aHXGFdGsMTTXpqnQMAumbOlYCsvI0lDA8MWr9kS_IauYJu7Pc7HrE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FtkzR5LXqN8Vnt9mkMmpUWLCSq2UTJh1DXXNgCTXqUk0y0xBhfB4tT9m44gCbRjalHs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DMtHfnotA0XegWD7UtgSkRqDETQkVIg-_RgX5JBSdTQWgz25eEi_vk9cU-PVZHmJJek"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vkOYfMMKwqdOCAAGrCxj34JXQG8-cJKd6zePwc96fTml4oP7_uDPfr-wxR2LmO883VBM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9_x7U_wZ08pm88lrwrY2v_TvTM5CNQoc_UGIRrWlMoBcYRhkBeOsLGCtU5KfXkyebA""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jul 31, 2013",1711683230000,"8.0.2","Keeping travelers safe and informed is our top priority.
