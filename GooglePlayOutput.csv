Entertaining. | Love it | App won't open! can't rate game if i can't play the game. So frustrating after multiple clear cache and data app still won't open. Reached out to support directly about the issue still haven't gotten back a response. Unistalled to install back app just won't open for me. It sucks!! | Things getting more difficult with screens to achieve | Truly addictive!! | Fun but don't like games that make you pay to play | Best game ever! | Played and purchased. I un-installed the game as the game is done so you have to spend money to be able to achieve the targets, which I understand... but.. I was able to merge several items to create a producing item as I needed another producing item that comes out of it.. well.. the producing item did not provide me with even one of these producing items.. which is not normal.. Just that it knew I was looking for these specific items to produce an order I was working on. I was cheated. | This game is addictive! & lots of fun :) | Tech team needs to fix the glitches it keeps kicking me out right after opening the app please fix i love this game and hate to have to stop playing it . It's really starting to make me mad | Give it 10 out now 10 | I Really loved this game. I got addicted to it. Just one suggestion please, it would be great if there is an option to buy some diamonds with our earned coins as well. Hope you will add this in your next update release | Fine | The game is very interesting üò∑üñ§ | Enjoying but energy takes too long | It's difficult don't understand it | üòä | Great game. Just wish there were more options to earn energy. | Love it | Fine | Great! | I genuinely enjoy this game. However each update makes it more and more impossible to play. The stationary is now impossible to get anything you actually need. I wish I could uninstall updates. While I don't mind spending money occasionally it is impossible to level up and complete orders if you don't. And the card packs are basically impossible to complete! Im really considering uninstalling if usability doesn't get easier. | Great | Lovely game | Fun | Want to try it | Love this game! | Fun to pass the time | I love this game ty | Lots of fun! | I get addicted...so fun to play | Fun game to play. | It's relaxing but wish there were more ways to earn the energy instead of pay to play. | Fun game,come try it out | Why are the ads not working? I tap it for the 25 energy it starts to play the same exact ad and stops then restarts the game .nothing added. And now the new card game started and I can barely Play because I cannot get the ads to play successfully and also when I tap on a item that comes up for a free one with and ad same thing. This never happened before. I'd really like to be able play Please fix thank you! | Great game | Fun | Very fun game to play after work while winding down...love it | So far so good. | Entertaining | Downloaded but not able to open app | Fun game Kept me entertained | nice,nice | Fun addictive | I really should have read the reviews before starting to play this game. DON'T PLAY! It is a very fun game, but after about level 30, it takes too long to create items and you rarely get to achieve all the daily tasks without paying for extra time. They just changed the game and added higher level items which makes it harder. Specialty items are so hard/take too long to get without buying them. Just seem money hungry when charge up packs are $10 or higher and doesn't give much. | Its fun and enjoy | This game is really slow. Other than that it's alright | At the moment having to rate this only a 2 star would have been 5 but at the moment having problems with it freezing when starting the game up. | Very nice game like it so much must try once üòÑ | It just stops after sometime saying you need energy every 2 min...I just need something to relax, but not as advertised | Downloaded from Mistplay, Accidentally Addicted! | Love playing it, is much fun | Very bad | I like the game | I am totally addicted | This game does nothing except force you to pay money around every corner to be able to enjoy it a little (not fully because you feel cheated into paying money). It is purely driven by greed of its developers! | I like it! | Awesome game and very cool | Fun game | Super | Game won't work for me. Downloads to 97% then never finishes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Shut down and restarted my phone. Have no other issues with any other game. | I like the game. The graphics and concepts are great but the game constantly closes out while I am playing. | Froze every time on start up at 99%. | Great addicted | Love it | ok | Fun game | I love this game | ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ | It is a fun game | i keep get stuff taken from me and like with out get coins | Money Hungry.. I used to love to play this game, but with the recent update, it's nearly impossible without spending money every day to complete the daily task. They need to go back to being reasonable. | I love this | The game doesn't load properly. Goes as far as 97% | Up to level 10 so far so good | It's such an amazing gameü§© I just wish there could be infinite energy. | üíï | üòáüòáüòáüòá | Good all round | I enjoy playing this game as it relaxes me. The game also keeps moving so I don't get bored of it. I could play for hours if my budget allowed it. However, for the third time today I clicked on my card pack to open it and the app just closes. When I reopen the 4 star card pack is gone. I think the size of some of the ads are too big as it glitches when I watch it and afterwards... No reward. | Every time, for the last 3-4 updates, I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. | You can make it work if you want to come play with me | I love match games and this one is going to be one of my favorites!! | i like it | Need more than 2 daily trades | This game won't even load have been trying for 30 mins when it gets to 99 percent it boots you back to google play | I love this game. I'm addicted | I love this game. Really fun and fantastic. A must play game, very captivating and addictive. Awesome. | I really enjoy this game, so addictive! But why watching ads option doesn't work for me anymore? | Lovely characters and concepts, but after level 20ish it slows to a max of 10 minutes play with 5 of those minutes spent to load and exit the impossible daily challenges and pay for energy/gem adds, and 2 -5minutes to tap and merge 100 energy, then there's nothing to do but exit and wait 3-4 hours...after a week or so of going on 2-4 times a day, you may get to sell something and after several weeks get enough money to upgrade, and once in a blue moon get a card pack with a bit more energy. | It's fun | The game play itself funnish, but unless you pay, you're not completing daily objectives at higher levels. also, you have to friend people on fb to friend them in the game to trade cards, and you can't trade gold cards. It's very frustrating not getting to complete anything in the game without paying money to do so. | Kind of okay to play bored | Great game! | Really enjoying playing this game it's quite addictive I start playing and always lose track of time | Wish I could more energy faster | Fun game | I luv this game a enjoying....bt i tried my best to add friends bt cant ..plzz help.. | stressful you can't even add a friend to share cards | Nice, and relaxing Game app | enjoying this game | Fun game!!! | Em determinado momento exige muita energia para pouco progresso. | Great game | This game is ridiculous I've worked all day to get a tool box and still haven't achieved there are no rewards with gems I've spent $ so far but am not continuing to ..it takes way to long(200 min almost 3 hours) to renew energy and 100 doesn't get very far smh ..you get plenty of coins but no gems probably will delete its frustrating üò§ | Oh great. Another town building game that was not mentioned In the ads. I hate town building games. Yes, you need to combine objects but then have to build a town. Not interested, so deleting the game. Boring. | Just started playing this today and I don't think I'm going to last long. It takes too long to refill energy. With adhd there's too much lagging to keep me piqued. | Like it | great way to keep your stress down | Love it | Very addictive love the graphics and its relaxing. So much to do to keep you busy | Only problem I have is to trade cards you have to become Facebook friends. | Having only a 100 energy bar is too low. You can't make enough items with it to progress the game. This has made the game no longer fun. You would literally have to pay to play every day. I don't understand why you all can't at least add more ads to watch for energy. At minimum the energy bar should get bigger as your level gets higher. I have the same 100 energy bar that I started with. Participating in events is even harder because of it. You aren't listening to your customers. | Fun but... goes by way to fast to have to buy coins | Love the game, great past time | This game is soooooo addicting and I LOVE IT! If there is a problem, which I only had one small problem, I was able to go to settings and message them and they took care of it within a couple of hours. Amazing customer service. DID I mention that I LOVE this game lol. There is only ONE thing that I truely wished they would change. Being able to have friends INSIDE the game that we can trade thongs like energy everyday and chat with inside the game and trade cards INSIDE the game!!!! | Obsessed with this game!! Favorite game ever!!! Only would like to have more than 100 ‚ö°Ô∏èas you advance levels though. | luv it | Fun but expensive | Love it | Nice game | Very nice | Very addicting!!! | The game was really fun at the beginning. But it's clear the creators are solely focused on making money. It's impossible to progress in the game with how hard the levels are and the low amount of energy given. All the want is for you to buy anything, pretty sad that they have to ruin a game by being incredibly greedy. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé | Did update. Now game won't play. It gets to the daily quest. And then closes itself. Not happy. Fun game. | Fun game but it's way too expensive to progress , energy is not enough to do any of the challenges, force you to spend real cash , and yet it's not even cheap , Uninstall | Addictive so fun | JELLO | 19 hours left to complete the album and I'm 20 cards short, mostly missing the golden cards that you can't swap with other players. I have cards duplicates in ridiculous amounts (10-19 duplicates of the same card). No matter how much money and time you spend in this game, you don't get to complete the daily challenges, weekly challenges or the album. We need something in exchange for the duplicates (energy, diamonds, something!?). Make the challenges more realistic to accomplish please! | If I didn't check in Google Play Store I would not have known that it needed to be updated. 9/10 times I can't enter the game. That's how bad it is. | I love this game! The only issue is ENERGY AND DIAMONDS. More of these would make it more interesting. Otherwise, kudos guys. Great job!‚ù£Ô∏è | Amazing. It's so fun. Entertaining. | Fun and addictive game! | Funny fun | Love this game | This game is getting boring... You need to purchase enable to finish all cards set. | Relaxing games | My favorite game to play! | Good | I'm still not getting time I'm playing | I love this game. It is like nothing I have every played B4. I went broke playing this game. It was that fun. But it didn't seem to reward you for spending $ to play. the 100 energy cap they give you isn't enough to do anything with. long story short, I deleted game so I couldn't spend any more $ on it. I am heartbroken not to play! if I ever win the lottery I will reinstall. | Im a little addicted. üò¨ | Very addictive | Luv this game | This game is good one but as you progress it takes alot of energies to complete a single order which make so so difficult to complete dail task For the album, it's worse because they're not giving new cards even the gold ones are hardest to get Its been a three week and I only got two new cards and all the duplicates | Merge, collect, upgrade, advance story, trade cards and meet people. Keeps you engaged. Update: idea for improvement. You should make it we can send gold cards on last day of seasons and also maybe have extra send or two then. Bit frustrating when you get so close to finishing sets but can't get the gold cards | excellent | This game is addictive | engagging, simple and relaxed to play | I tried to install this game as I've had no problem in the past doing so with other games this game would not let me do anything on my phone it turned my screen black which lasted hours my friend sorted it for me unistalled now wpnt be doing it again | Great game I loved it I play this game Daily | I like this game but why when I click on the energy ONCE it takes 2! | Ur game stalled | I love this game.. makes me curious about what is coming next. Never boring ‚ù§ | I love the game | I have never played merge games this is my first one and I LOVE IT!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | you will get bored fast because you have to wait for a long time to generate energy to play , it forces you to purchase to play which something so annoying. | Amazing üòÑ love it | good game | these games are getting better. | At first lived it great way to take your mind of things but it's getting harder n harder to progress unless u spend money | Nice app I been playing this everyday | Very good | In love! So fun | Hard to reach goals | I love this game, play it all the time when I have nothing else to do. | Day by Day Interested but one Problem moves are so short..! Thankyou | My stress reliever üòÅ | Addictive!! | I'm having a lot of fun | It's an addiction game try not to spend but couldn't resist it | Great Game!!! If I could have a chance to earn more diamonds üòú. Highly recommend. | This is my favorite merge game so far. The only negative for me is the lack of options to get additional energy without spending money. | Fun | It is fun and challenging. No need to spend money just enjoy the game. | Was amazing before the last update. You were able to play without having to pay $$ just fine. Now it's pretty impossible to meet the daily goals, diamonds are few, and you need way more energy for regular items. Also, the new art is terrible. Downgraded for sure. | The globe has to have money again!!! We hate the chests we get for all the days we spend making the globes!!! Globes=Money!!!! Hate the chests, please fix that! Year later still want the globes fixed | It is adicting | Awesomeness | Keeps my interest; not boring. | Addicted to this game | This game melt my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è with moonactive always satisfied | Relaxing and engaging. Helps you think creatively | good but hard to complete challenge üòÖ | Fun but run out of energy fast | I'm really enjoying this wonderful game | This game is fun but when you reach higher levels it becomes difficult to get coins and complete orders. Energy refill time should be reduced and energy capacity should be increased from 100 to 200 atleast. The cards challenge is good but getting repetitive cards is annoying especially golden cards. | no diamonds | Super fun and relaxing. Doesn't require actual money to keep playing üòÄ | Addictive | The best game I've played in a while | Fun game. Didn't think I'd like it but I love it | Fun game | Good game, but we need more energy | I don't like this game. | My experience has been great... Love the game.. Certainly engaging.. My best wishes to the developer and teamüòä | Hard to get what you need and I don't know how to get rid of extra tool boxes and board is almost full . | I really enjoy this game, but the latest update has decreased the coin value for some items. The daily challenges used to be something I enjoyed completing, but they have become so difficult, to the point of the impossible, to complete (without spending money). As the game processes, the orders become increasingly difficult as one would expect, yet the energy counter remains capped at 100. If higher levels equated to a higher energy cap, you'd have some very happy players :) | But I wish to enjoy more the collecting of cards and finishing quests are much easier | The best game I ever play","{""1"":10817,""2"":3064,""3"":6129,""4"":6129,""5"":128729}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†26.99 - CZK¬†2,699.99 if billed through Play","5.1","5.1","VARY","Magmatic Games LTD","4765571944833116862","support@traveltowngame.com","https://support.traveltowngame.com","207 Regent Street,

They let hotels cancel a 8-person booking one day on you ONE DAY in advance for literally no reason, and there is NO OPTION at all in their thrash workflow to address this. Worse, there is no way to speak to an agent if you don't fit in 'their flow'.

I highly recommend it | The app shows higher price than the website for the same room from my own profile. The website shows a discounted price for the 'pay now' option whereas the app shows the same price with no discounted option for payment. I am currently in Japan now. I just found out about it. I have a feeling I have been paying a higher price for the last few days just because I had been booking through the app. | no support in emergency situation, scammed for money, no customer service | Thankyou so much | It makes it easy to find affordable accommodations | Information that I need | easy to book.. | Advertises properties that when you proceed to book are not available. | It makes things easier for us It so helpful | Great | Good experience | one price when searching, another (higher) when reserving. shame. being genius 3, prefer airbnb over this scam service. Car rental allows you to book a car, be cheated you have your reservation confirmed and when you come at the rentals, they say it is not confirmed. But you get billed for that reservation and need to open a support case to refund. No car, no money, wasted time and efforts. | Booking. Com really such a very useful app.thank booking.

What is the update actually for? | I'm | Always there for me and also resolve problems quickly | Great | Easy to use and gets me great deals!! | Scammers and awful customer service, which the customer service was non existent. They cheat on you. If some hostel/hotel doesn't do things correctly and you overpaid. The Booking will give you the money back but not at the full prive of what the hostel owe you. Then they ignore and block you from speaking to them. Edit to respond your replies. No, you're not responding nor anything. I tried to find the option to message you but you blocked me off. Just stop scam people and take responsibility? | The program doesnt help you solve problems with companies that they offer to you. Too awfull. | Very fast booking | Always have great rooms | First time user, everything is on point so far. Also the cheapest booking option. Looked at a range of services that all booked the same rental home, it was a lot cheaper here. And they did the best job at the booking process, no glitches and clear information.

Edit regarding Bookings response: This doesn't solve that the messages tab still does not work! | Ok its good | Esey to used | I have been using other booking apps and this is my first time for this app. What is the use of getting CC details for confirming the booking and still you have to pay in the property because they did not charge it to your CC. Think of how inconvenient it is on the part of your customers. | Why can't you show the total price if it includes various taxes so that different destinations can be compared like for like? | Very easy to use and good prices.. | Excellent application üëç | Wonderful | Fast and precise app. easy to access | Fantastic search facility! | Easy fast reliable | Great rates and saving | This app used to be very good, but after the last experience getting 0 support even thou I have a genius 3 level and are supposed to get premium one, I am very upset with it and will consider other providers! | Awesome services üëè | Terrible. I booked a room and when I arrived to the hotel the admin said the app was not supposed to have let me book anything because they were full. I called custoner service on booking and no one assumed responsability about the issue I was having. Don't waste your time, if you have a problem with the app they will just leave you stranded wherever you are. | So easy to book reservations - been a satisfied customer for years! | Thank you | The App is not optimised for my tablet and will not open in landscape mode. This is inconvenient because now I can't enjoy using the platform from my tablet, even if I try and go online using a browser it detects that I have the app and redirects me automatically, its so annoying. | Quick and Easy to use! | Nice app & really helpful. | Exceptional, it's provides avery information required including the cost. Love it | I got better price than the actual hotel booking system | Good | Good | Great and efficient | v good experience üòâ | decline my card verification without detailed reasons | Nise | The message system doesnt work.

You can only book and after that they evade all the responsibilities that are due to them, and you cannot cancel or postpone the trip, and you cannot contact customer service after that because they evade the answer, and therefore it is one of the worst applications ever.

We really had a very good time. | Very easy to access and use if you are not very technical | yesterday we went to M'Xlokk at Capo Restaurant and the food was fantastic I recomand it to you. it is value for money | Good app to find enough details on places, great tool to help on private tour.. | Requires 200 characters review ..stupid | Very GOOD | Love this app | Well set out and easy to use | Best | Good üëç | Much improved and responsive | All good | Excellent! | This travel app is easy to use and is full of information on different destinations, prices, etc. with travellers' reviews on where to stay, eat, day trips, or best for families, couples, groups, or different abilities. | Best way to find places to go! | Honesty and the recommendations / advice of others is very important. | Easy to use app for the mobile | Didn't let me rate a bad restaurant 1 star because I mentioned ""cockroaches"" in the review. TripAdvisor offered me a confirmation link for it that was broken, so I couldn't confirm and they didn't publish my review. If I can't inform other users about horrible places, then I won't trust TripAdvisor anymore. | Great App and Very helpfull while planning traveling in India | the best app in the worl I can make good business with the tripadvisor very good | So useful | Tarados con la inscripcoon terrible | Always favorite | It's really helpful and useful especially for new travelers | Great | A great app to find and locate places to visit at home and abroad. Easy to navigate and bookmark favourite places have been or want to go to | Always easy to use and so helpful when looking for suitable places. | Another developer who claims they can't produce the errors on their system, of Campsie a suburb of Sydney being shown when I search for Casino how they consider they use a mobile phone to do a search like I did? And think I don't know how to do a screenshot üò†üò†üò† | Amazing offers | It's a best app for anyone to check the reviews and select the property | Great travel planner | A reliable place to go to for reviews. Well worth having g when considering visiting new places. | Love tripadvisor! Get reviews before you book and give feedback on your trips, what's not to like, it's a great community! | It ok . | Got stucked non stop... very upsetting. | Very nice application... | I use it for every trip I plan | I've put up a review because the honest reviews that I have read allowed me to plan and enjoy the trips that I have taken. Keep up the good work. | Those who review and own the app are great all these years I have used the app and appreciate my reviews | Okay | Awesome to share travel secrets with each other! Great app. | Good | Correct guidance | This is a very bad company to book trip from they canceled my trip and did not pay back the refund, I have been waiting for 4 months now and the only answer I keep getting from thier customer service is that they have escalated the issue the team will get back to you. And till date no one from thier team has ever got back to me and from past 4 months and my money has also not been refunded . They are only interested in stealing your money do not use this site for bookings ! | Best application | Absolute scam, persecuted small business owners into paying high fees for their premium business services with no return on investment and don't cancel the service even when requested. Then follow with illegal business practices to try enforce payments despite repeated requests to cancel. Making an official complaint to Google regarding this practice. | I always use this app when planning a trip | Helping tool to get perfect outcomes | A good trustworthy way to find the good stuff as well as the dirt on hotels. üòÅ | Why isnt my review appearing? | You're just loud üì¢ but useless ideas if possible I like to give you final notice for - minus ‚ûñ | Really Great Service | Much helpfull | I love that this is ""one stop shopping"" for anything and everything you need to know when traveling. It's all at your fingertips! It's also easy to use and to rate. I LOVE the fact it gives you suggestions of things to see and do in every city you visit and helps you find ""one of a kind"" experiences. The people who rate places seem to give more indepth information than other sites do and those ratings have made my trips so much more fun! I NEVER go anywhere without checking Trip Advisor! | The app currently works great, even better than the web version, in my opinion. Easy to use and stable | perfect | Grat app easy to use does what is says on the tin | Easy to navigate. Confused videos are still not allowed to upload. Dratz | Informative | Loved the AI trip planning | Always helpful to read other traveler's reviews. | Used to LOVE it, changes and never the same | This is my go-to app for hotel reviews. It never lets me down! I use it when I'm abroad too. Being able to see customer photos of hotels is really important. I like visitor ratings too. | Gr8 guide!!!! Have been using this app for very many years! Just discovered that i've been a member for over 2 decades!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | Very good app | Very bad. It is show a very low price like 700 SEK then when i click on the option the price will be like 5560 or something like that. I delete it ofcourse | Can't save our location. No area map of search items. Useless phone app. | A must-have for traveling, dining, attractions, lodging, etc. Thank you! | A must have for travelers | Amazing platform for choosing traveling | Been using for many years.. | Sadly TripAdvisor listed the hotel I'm currently staying at is having a pool and it doesn't. I felt like I threw away $194. As a rule I find them very dependable but I'm quite disappointed in this circumstance cuz I would never have booked here had it not had a pool. | The best travel app | Great for finding and leaving reviews | Always use trip advisor, it's been very accurate | First class. | For me it is very useful app to be very updated about the best options to enjoy around the world. | Wonderful experience... | Great for checking out hotels to stay in when going on holiday. Decent for checking out nearby restaurants and tourists attractions. | Best App for travel tips | Good | Good","{""1"":514520,""2"":75215,""3"":37426,""4"":121362,""5"":698744}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Tripadvisor","Tripadvisor","mobilehelp@tripadvisor.com","https://www.tripadvisor.com",,"https://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/privacy.html","Tripadvisor","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ty1qRqzjHcL6VMtcBRF3170LZ4McoQZcoRbYTq7Y8ruPKXoNMGudcUGnp5_7EgPLNA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IUcCk_IQWznWErEUQbaORGO9oZbIRwH9rToameTAu0qv2OnKKBJcCFhN1MIxYHn1","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nwrK6P8bH3BXtfopcomnHQ5NqSsOWLzPqHDqnP8XFDKtYQFXan2L8G3Hq0VOcKnx0Jg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fyv1kW0vVieQ_yMCG2YYu8fHPFS6__BJ9d_vwCJW823zZnZN2k-irg8TmP9_pFWQQg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qyfAqo-FeznRRBM3qt2M_KQNaWqCWbxlgI7F3NzL7uid5kTBSkFI90L7RRo_E5E1aw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7vl4umj3Tu92K3OIs4uWXjyY4v-CsXecqm-ywTHp_OQUoVP5p4nR3HKpFEqpnobIoEU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BgTxH6L5y4BZ8ddXkk30meds93vGNTxMsaIFPjCbHCcCxh6ew1VxP-rAKdU_QtMYACUW"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SAym51ZfxTe3xMDKJMNlyL9Y7JP8sur09j04KNBJJCDGkMLBZtlV39rrKxoYA3SdzA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FyA-S-5qgmcrUQkzmZNj027v3-CKbC0Dowl3-4DK9Jslbdf1NJoHfdLkz0Qs4-hwEg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9qcl7gkpWP42_QwwvqUlXVkZfw1jT-C3prOADlvBG6yFmlBDeYkbw1fG2qw7T6w-0w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V7SUqzNauq8hk97tDPcshoFwLjfBUHUCSKe__s2mj8H9OQ_bdoniijGjbpjy_UFJkU0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/61LPPzT-4YCoJ37LQ54k1DKXLj6FhiGKsVPs2dO_Vf3e0ijGv2E_sU37Yw6FfKnS2g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QlhRvjbNYovBOEcIZ3-awKtQVswUe9tEMopfi4vwBfsoUWbIHrzYUpbFcFTutt62jiU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/B6ZgQO7e5d45Ts731VEHxrQV2E00L2EeS3Q1HU0Vdgr63xYxaNYG9AlgupW5r3VFZomD""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,true,"Jul 12, 2010",1713892261000,"57.3","Improvements to the Trip planning product which allow travelers to:<br><br> - Receive a custom AI itinerary backed by traveler reviews<br> - View saves in an organized list within the saves tab<br> - Build an itinerary by adding saves and organizing them by day<br> - View saves plotted on a map<br>","[null]",false,false,false,"com.tripadvisor.tripadvisor","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripadvisor.tripadvisor&hl=en&gl=CZ"

The images shown are not exact to the places. Location available only after booking and that too hazzle cancellation policy. | Tried to book a one night stay. First, they wanted a profile pic, then the last 4 of my ssn, then a pic of the front and back of my photo id and another pic of me. Sounds like identity theft waiting to happen. No, thank you, Air bnb. Idk who you think you are, but this is ridiculous. I booked the exact same place on vrbo with none of this invasive bs. Won't be back. | It's been excellent to compare rooms and locations. | Is it ok for couples to rent a room? | I Absolutely Love Airbnb.. | üòçü•∞üëç | Is very easy and convenient | Great app! Easier to use than vrbo! | Great app happy with it so far | Easy booking process and great value for money. | Great app | Reliable and user friendly. | You can not find my camera | First ever host illegally canceled on me. Second host, which i had to find myself, his apartment was in the hood. The place was dirty. Lawn was unkept. No microwave even. What a nightmare. Waste of money. Got a hotel like i should have in the first place. EDIT: Airbnb gave a refund and paid for 20% or the hotel. It was enough for me to add a star and give them another chance. I found a place for this summer that is by a superhost with a cabin in the mountains that has only amazing reviews. | Cannot change name - ""Save Changes"" button does not do anything. | Pretty clear if a little complex. | Login does not work | Works terrible in dark mode on Android 10. Half of all content is white whit the grey text, almost unreadable | Worst customer support ever what trash!!!!!! | Airbnb will not accept your booking and they will not refund the money. Why you take money before booking confirmation and never refund it. Scammers | We have enjoyed using Airbnb for over 5 years both domestically and internationally. Seldom look at hotels anymore. | Don't like the fact that it raises the prices of places as you browse. And no its not because all of a sudden the listing is in ""high demand for those days"" because if a comepletely different time slot is seached the high price stays the same | Using it since 5 years now, it's goto app for booking amazing stays around the world. | MF Never give them your money they are untrustworthy. If you ever got a reservation and it turned bad one, YOUR MONEY IS LOST. Note that they will keep to be polite. | I haven't used this app but looking at reviews online and video on YouTube I really preferred save money and go to a hotel . no thanks | Easy to deal with! | Easy to use. | Great experience using the airbnb app | Great app but shame they allow people to advertise on stolen land and property, otherwise I'd have given it 5 stars | Very bad support | Extremely easy | It's always easy & reliable! | No se puede cambiar a pesos mexicanos y toda la aplicasion sale en Ingles | Chatting with Bryan from South Carolina... has been a tremendous help | Muy conveniente y rapida ayuda para encontrar lugar donde hospedarnos..mucha variedad de lugares y precios. Excelente app !!! | This man gave address so I was able to get close to my location | I now understand how people are making money off of others . If I had property, this would be the best and easiest way to make a buck, and that is just off of cancelations alone. Gonna stick to hotels or VRBO. Done with this site. It's definitely not good for using if it's a business event. Gotta get a lawyer now, yay! | Great app, I always find amazing places all over the world. | Great App, user friendly. I'm a host and a guest and it's nice to use the same app for both things. | So far so good | Have been a regular user of AirBnB for 6 years. Love it! | Awesome booking process. So easy and tailored! | Loved it. Can easily reserve and stay in places. It's also affordable. | Pushes too many notifications. Don't need to be harassed. | Great. | The management that runs this app from the Philippines is biased and unprofessional. Between guests and hosts, the Philippines management tends to give more credits to guests. It considers 3 star rating from guests as a bad review and will take actions by retracting the supper host designation and suspension of account eaven if the host has average 4.9 rating from over a 100 guests! Also when texting customer care in the Philippines they close the case with out replying due to time difference | Not a welcoming platform. The few hosts who even respond to new users only tell them ""you can't rent from us until you have positive feedback"" when I finally found a place that would accept me less than 48 hours from intended check in despite ample planning I was forced to rent a much more expensive place than I wanted. The app works well though | Used it for the first time, and I had a big problem during my stay and Airbnb simply didn't care | no map visible when choosing a place?! | I can't find a hotel with prices even close to half of what these lunatics are charging. I saw a 1970 trailer on a swamp for $800 a night. | It is very easy to navigate | Perfect. | Great app. Easy to use. Love the wishlist. | Always A pleasure doing business with AirBnB | Always so awesome | Easy to use and great hosts! | They lost my trust. They deleted my review most probably at the request of the host. They just stated that it violates the airbnb's guidelines but never specified which one. I read on reddit and quora that many other guests had their reviews removed just like this. I will definitely think 10 times before booking through airbnb these days. | Generally very easy-to-use. Have had wonderful experiences in US, | So far so easy. | Good choices of property but shared homes with more then 1 stranger is enough. | Easy & Fast | Fantastic | Terrible! | User Friendly | Easy to use, good search options. | I wouldn't know all this is under being surveillance from gangs not goodbye your all fools | Great place to find places to rent, ive used it a few times now and have had no issues | The service is awful I've had this app for 7 years and never used it until the beginning for April 2024 The hosts could not get it together. Canceled on me a week before my reservation, then the new host I got ghosted me and her property was a catfish. It posed a health risk to my partner where we had to vacate the premises at 4:30 am. Air bnb said they would reimburse us our hotel stay we had to get in THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT and then proceeds to deny me a refund and reimbursement. | I love Airbnb!!! Reasonably priced stays for all income levels. | Easy to book . Way cheaper than other sites . I saved over ¬£400 | love it | Easy to use great app | So easy to use and takes the worry out of booking in a different area. X | Too early, not made my first check in yet | New to Airbnb.......so easy to use, thanks. | good apps for travel stay. easy to book | Game changer in platform economy | Worst experience of my life .. even at the same time after cancelling because have timing iaaue with the host they took all the money ... very very very disappointing experience .. | Best of all | phenomenal, unicorn | After staying at an apartment in Spain, we were charged extra by Airbnb for damages we were not responsible for. Airbnb took the money out my account without reviewing my response to the claim properly. | Lifesaver app | Playground for greed and dishonesty | We always find good deals through this platform. | The Airbnb support is ridiculous and unbearable, I have an opened case that is not being addressed at all, they won't even give us a proper timeline and just say 'wait'. Well, I have been waiting for days. | Love it. One of the best booking apps I've ever used. Come to think of it the only one and wouldn't use any other. | We've had our suspicions and it was confirmed today. The new update with the calendar pricing view definitely broke something in your app. I have specifically opted to get a day notice to clean the flat, but today someone was able to book my Airbnb last minute for 3 days. Airbnb's app bug has put me in a very difficult position where I have to try and clean last minute for a foreign guest. I've switched off instant booking and won't use it again as clearly I can't trust trust the automation. | Very Good | Most useless App & very unfriendly to user. They took advance payment from me for a booking & then didn't confirm my booking, telling me that , they are unable to verify my ID, though I submitted my ID details, 3 times to them. I am unable to understand, why they took advance payment from me, when they are unable to verify my ID?? üëé | Aivan pelle sivusto, yhden illan aikana olis ollu tarkotus p√§√§s√§ ouluun y√∂ksi mutta mielummin t√§m√§ sivusto kyselee henkkareita, mit√§ siis annettiin, mutta kesti sivustolla/sovelluksella melkein viikon edes yritt√§√§ sopia asia, ett√§ t√§h√§n malliin t√§m√§ sovellus hoitaa asiat. | Very easy to navigate | Very easy and straightforward to use.. a must have app when using AirBNB! | I like that it is user friendly & it's security | I had a bad experience with one hostes but airbnb came thru and help my need thank you | the best | Used to be such a wonderful app to book your stay with, now it seems way too many hosts play the ""non-refundable"" card, which shouldn't be there in the first place imo. Also, used to provide safer bookings, more rigid security is needed to protect guests from frauds. Still a good app, you just need to know how to navigate these things. | Fast and easy | I like this app is convenient to find a place to stay üôÇ | Travel the world | Charged me a $75 cleaning fee after customer service assured me I would not be charged this extra undeserved fine. They also took down my review of the property I stayed. I just wanted a vacation rental, not wild claims that lead to extra charges for a property that wasn't even cleaned properly when we arrived. | It works well and I have not encountered any issues. | Easy to use . Great app | I like air bnb, but man i tried 3 times in a row to book an appartment and it doesnt let me cause of ""party risks"" what the hell i litterally chose the 1 person guest options... thats really inconvenient.... | Asad aliyyi | Love it! | Difficult! | Haven't had no issues with the app very good service | Easy to use. | First experience using the app and it's very user friendly and helpful will definitely be using this for the future | Very easy to navigate | Easy peasy | Amazing intermediary for looking places to stay and getting to know your host. | very quick and easy booking | Nightmare !! I had to sleep in my car in the middle of winter because they couldn't find me a replacement accommodation following my host's last minute cancellation. I received a simple refund of what I paid and had to find another rent myself for the rest of my stay. ü§¨ | Airbnb allows very bad host behaviour and does nothing to prevent it. There aircover is also a facade and if something goes wrong they will not help you just waste your time. | Super easy and convenient to use. | Wonderful!! | Update. It's still terrible! I am not a big fan of this app. It has glitches and bugs. For instance, logging in as an issue. Also, if you have a manager, you have to share login information because they don't have an invite option. I'm surprised Airbnb has such a poor application. There are also issues with payout to the host and co-host. You would think the owner would be able to receive the payments, but there are technical glitches that even customer service can't fix. This company sucks! | It's really smooth and great UI UX. Perfect place to locate a perfect stay option. We use it a lot. Helps us find great places to stay in A home away from home | Ridwaan | Good selection of places. First guy rejected us b/c he uses his home. He should block out those dates | Amazing | Always very useful when finding accommodation in our trips | Easy to use | üëç | Cancelled my already paid booking for the unknown verification reasons | Pleasant say....where ever I went.... | Make ur life easy when travelling! I've used this all over Europe and Southeast Asia. | So far so good | good | Great app | Easy to use | Easy booking, clear fees and rates. | I have always had wonderful experiences on Airbnb and hope to continue that trend. Customer Service has always been extremely helpful, and I've had great hosts thus far. | Great experience using the APP. Very interactive. | App works well, just annoying that it never displays the actual price | Easy to book, accurate descriptions, easy pay, easy refund. | Great homes, reviews, photos and videos help make decisions easy! | Very easy to use! | Easy an fast Especially when you work out of town an you need a room real quick | 3 days in a row nothing but update, Update, UPDATE!!! Get your code halfway stable! | Super nice platform | From search to book good property Airbnb is best... | Easy to use! | Use the app daily, great product. Unfortunately have to change my mind. I was hacked and couldn't access my account and no help from Airbnb 4 days later. | An easy-to-use app! | Always so easy to navigate and find exactly what I'm looking for. | Always been successful. | Good | Great experience all the way around | App is ""good"", but needs better integration for messaging in Outlook. | It's convenient | Love it!!!! | Easy app to use. | Quick and easy! | Its nice | App auto billing without any further setps to confirm booking. Like accident booking. Right after that - in few min, we contacted and communicated to service center but no any solutions to cancel booking. Bad experience | Redefine how you travel it is the quintessential travel necessity | Its asking for password wich is strong but still asking for a strong password I was type another one and even if you put few words still weak so uninstall it after so many years use it disappointing... | Booking is extremely painful. Hosts never reply. It feels a contest more than booking a stay. | It is good price but not very much user friendly | Don't recommend as a host. | Easy to use, great filters | Wow it very nice | Goof | Let's sleep in the street. We take money and that's it. Bye bye Support will support. After a few days. Be patient | Very easy to find accommodation | Honestly one of the worst sites I've used. Even after my identity had to be verified with photo ID and selfie I still can not book my vacation condo. ""Something went wrong. Please try again"" is all I get. Customer support is useless in trying to fix it. I've never had an issue on VRBO. | Airbnb has gone downhill | GREAT | Booking was easy. My first trip on here. I will let ya know. | EZ to search, find properties and communicate with hosts if necessary | Convenient... | Airbnb gas provided me with affordable and comfortable places to stay all over the world! | Easy to use which is great. | Excellent | Never had a difficulty in year's. Supported me once in getting a refund. Keep up the good work! | I'm so sick of selecting ""good rates"" just to see them double or tripple when its time to actually book it | Easy peasy | Refund initiated on 3 April due to cancellation from other side, 18 April is the time sought to refund......they say the amount refunded but not yet credited....asking me to seek help from financial institution....Looking into legal ways to get refunded | Very easy to book. I would prefer to have more details of location when searching apartments | Very efficient and informative | I used this application to book an accommodation in Vienna a d my experience wa very terrible with the host and after when I complaint the presumed 24/7 customer service. After having a bad check in experience with the host, I have called airbnb Support to complaint and to find a solution for me at around midnight of the 20 th Apr 2024 in Vienna. The time of response was slow and they putted me in hold so many times and sent from a department to another without solution and bad faith from them. | Good | A great travel app! I have never left my country before but AirBnB has made the experience of traveling from Canada to Kyrgyzstan so much easier! | AMAZING PLACES | Clean up fee should be included in the list price. Other than that. Great app and options. | It would be great if this app had a dark mode where the colors shift from white to black for night owls such as myself in order to not strain my eyes too much. | It's very helpful I like Airbnb it is very helpful with my budget | I've been using this app since 2021 and it's a thing of beauty, works like a machine in synergy.

Scrolled through the app, requested to sign, I did but I don't think it was successful, then tried to add a favourite activity, had to sign in, was asked to make a list, went to create a list, app say opps can't do that now try again later, try again, asked to sign. Quick note I did sign in each time it asked but it never seemed to work | Constantly asks to re-login, never succeeds | Impossible to stay logged in. Logs in and shows my account for a millisecond before asking me to log in again. Tried multiple devices, apps, accounts, everything. Customer support said they didn't have the resources to troubleshoot it and the promo code only works on the app. Excellent way to get every email I own signed up to your service, I suppose. Easier to book directly with the tour operator. | They have more choices than others. | Reserved tickets to Colosseum in Rome.

Visiting Lisbon for the first time. They have a wide variety of options, well categorized and described. | Really useful for planning excursions last minute | Great app for buying tickets for attraction. | Nice to be able to book tours, museums and transfers all in one place | Easy to use | Discovering New Orleans just got a whole lot easier! This amazing app was our ultimate guide on our first trip to the Big Easy, serving up a wealth of expert suggestions and insider tips. With so many amazing experiences to choose from, we were spoiled for choice! What really made our trip unforgettable was the seamless booking process, detailed activity descriptions, turn-by-turn directions, and timely reminders, all at our fingertips. We explored the city like locals. My new travel companion. | Deri Kevin | Very conformable and informative tool for making the trip more fun and attractive. Very nice! üëç | Practical | Wonderful experience! Our guide Imraan was very helpful and made the experience enjoyable!! | Easy to use with competitive prices! | Easy to use | Easy to use app great prices | Easy | Easy to navigate and book on the app. | Just took a trip to New Orleans with my partner, and we had a blast thanks to this app. It took the frustration out of booking tours, transportation, food, etc., out of the whole trip. Best app to use if you're gonna travel and do lots of activities! | Good find for tour | I used this app with our travel in Europe, and it was amazing to helped us plan our trip ahead of time. | Great app With activities in so many cities :) With good customer service! Able to help with any issues ! Thank you so much ! | Fast and secure | It works | Easy and complete. | Have used a couple of trips. Easy and lots to choose from | Very easy to use and extremely helpful. | Greet | User friendly.. accurate | We love it | We got scammed by this app do not book though it | easiest and fastest way to plan your visit as a tourist | Great experiences. | mandatory for tourists while you don't have friend to assist in location, LOL | Great choices. Like the terms as well. | Easy to find and book tours. | Perfect ap | Easy Peasy | The activity provider/trader mislead using pictures and description that scams you. so please check what your activity provider does. and they blame the app for not giving them an option. | We should be able to edit our review after submiting it. I started a review, than stopped for doing something else and then i wasn't able to finish it. | Had to cancel and rebook my reservation because I didn't choose accommodations. The customer service was excellent. Great job and thank you. | All is easy to pick, to reserve, to pay | Awesome | was never able to complete a single purchase, error code 100 whatever before making payments... costumer service is useless and asked personal information like last for digits of credit card, date of birth etc... and 3 days later never heard from them it seems like a big personal information collector scheme or a scam. beware | I have used get your guide in 4 cities in the past 2 weeks, the app is great for keeping all the info I need close at hand. | Lots of options, easy to book | Love the app, makes it so easy make tour bookings | Great app when looking for adventures traveling alone, or in group! | Easy booking and very detailed descriptions that live up to in reality. | Booked two great guided tours through this all 1 Vesuvio and Pompei . 2. Napoli sotto terra EASY !!!!! PEASY!!!! | Value for money on all your travel needs | Gives lots of info and easy to use. | solid and secure | So user friendly üëç | Everything works. | Easy and excellent | Pointless app. Extremely fed up of companies thinking they need an app when a simple email will suffice. After booking my tour I received an email saying I would need the app to access the activity. So I had to download and install the app. But all the information was already in the email. I didn't need or use the app at all, and the tour company never once looked at it. Have now uninstalled on return home. | So fast! | A great choice of trips and things to do,very easy to use | I was told that the app was required for the trip. Using the directions took me to the wrong location, and I almost missed the boat. When I tried to board the boat using the QR code in the app, I was turned away and forced to go get a paper ticket. | Quick and easy to use | So far, so good. Search and booking functions are easy to use. | The support team awesome, I been surprised how they are very helpful and kind. | It's so great to not have to worry about making arrangements once you get on your vacation! | Great for finding local experiences at a competitive price | Uncooperative customer support | Awful. Did not work, support was useless, AVOID. We bought this, headed to the first location and that was it. No riddles, no next destination suggested. Support just kept saying to head to the first location and solve the riddles which was no help at all. Still no idea where/how to access the riddles and locations. Ruined the day, as we had no other plan and ended up seeing nothing. Don't waste your money. | Complete information, trusted reviews | I downloaded the app, and promocode didn't work. Felt cheated. On entering code, it kept giving a msg, ""code expired, ok got it."" Very unfortunate way to make people download the app and not living up to the promotions offered. | Love the ease | Easy to find tors and quick booking | DO NOT USE THIS APP. THEY CHARGE MORE FOR MAJORITY OF ACTIVITIES. | Lots of great choices and great service | Use the app and reserve everything all in one place. Super easy!! | Very easy and convenient to use | Great App Would recommend üëå | I've reserved activities with GetYourGuide twice now, and the first time we had a problem with the people from the activity itself. So GetYourGuide refunded us the whole amount. Very happy with their offerings and prices. | Great | Unable to transfer my bookings into the App, tried multiple times. | Seamless | I like to book here because it's more specific on the activities they offer and I cannot say more until I experience the actual activities. | Good app for tours. Sadly it doesn't allow posting photos and videos along with text only tour reviews. | Excellent service | Great | Fab app for trips/days out. Love it | Easy to use and navigate! | This app is a total SCAM. Don't ever use or download it. They lie in their advertisements and don't refund you. They also discriminate against disabled people and don't accommodate for them despite saying they do. They robbed me of almost $300 for a tour that didn't even go where they said it would and that didn't accommodate my disabled father when we were willing to only do part of the tour. That only cost 30. Ridiculous and disgusting customer service. | Good | Very helpful during our Europe trip for 2 weeks to visit all the Must-See places and tours. | Easy read and clear instructions | Great experience | Easy and fast | Should have a loyalty programme by now. It's been far too long. | It was okay at first, until I was told that ""if you have a purple ticket to see the eclipse, you can"". One, I didn't have one and two, get your guide never told me or had a special discount of that event. Tbh, it's not worth it. Never again. | Good and easy | Great app . . . So easy | Great program, great app. Puts all my side trips in one place. Easy to navigate | Break up details of transactions are not available on the app after booking tickets. Transaction amount shows 63$ CAD and at the end it charges 94$ CAD. It is like decieving customers and not providing full informarion. | Love this app! Makes bookings so easy! And with reliable tours in so many countries | I contacted operator through email and watsapp phone to cancel activity (Land of legends).However I did not get refund. This is my first time using get your guide and will certainly be my last time.On website they say they will refund your money if you cancel 12 hours before but that's not the case. | The app is not only really fun and easy to use, but their customer service is superb. I had a complaint, and they took it really seriously and solved it effectively. | Fabulous....very easy | Great App for booking | App has nice feature that allows you to access vouchers without WiFi. | Esay and reliable app. Extremely convenient during travel. | All tours provided have been excellent quality, easy to book and all necessary details for tours provided for easy access. | Very helpful | One of the worst experiences I've ever had was when I bought a ticket to visit the Louvre. Upon arrival, I was not allowed entry because what I had was a voucher, not the actual ticket required for entrance. Attempts to contact the company through emails and phone calls were never answered. Please try it before you decide to use this app. In general, I do not recommend this app at all. | Great experience so far!! | Tell me why do I need to install your app to view the tickets I bought? Surely the tickets can be sent over email. Horrible way of stealing people's data by masking that within the app you can 'change' or 'reschedule' bookings. Do better. | Made booking activities for my trip very convenient | Used this app several times all over the world. Everything a good experience. Highly recommended. | Easy, reliable travel activities - anywhere!!! | Great app have used it multiple times | Pervious tours in Vienna and Berlin were wonderfull and stress free because we booked in advance. | Great deals.. Great experiences üëè | Great and easy way to enjoy places you are. It would be better to have verifications so tours with no shows are reduced | Works well and user friendly interface | Absolutely hopeless I made and paid for a booking and I cannot find it, too hard to navigate website | Easy to use | Great | I've used this app to book a lot os different tour in different cities and never had a problem with the tours I booked, so it's being a very positive experience to me | Great App, very easy to use to find what you are looking for. | Great app | Great app for remote destinations | Very handy having the ability to book now and pay later | Great way to see whats on offer for your trip and to prebook some activites | Very happy using this program | All find great experience on here | The application isn't functional and no support is provided | I LOVE GetYourGuide! Wherever I go, I always find amazing experiences. The ratings I see from other tourists guarantee that I will have a wonderful time. I just got back from a two hour walking tour in Zurich, and the guide was so knowledgeable and made great recommendations for restaurants and places to go for drinks. Thank you, GetYourGuide, for the amazing events you guys have. | Very easy to navigate | Great app! Lots of activities! Offline mode is very convenient! | Good app. | Great, reliable and safe. | The Best!","{""1"":4328,""2"":0,""3"":1082,""4"":5411,""5"":99025}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","GetYourGuide","GetYourGuide","apps@getyourguide.com","http://www.getyourguide.com","GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH

Besides the watch issue everything is still fine. | amazing | Fantastic app very helpful | AWESOME APP FOR TRAVELLING WITH PUBLIC TRANSPORT | Best navigation app for public transport I have used. It not only gives you various options to choose from, but also calculates walking time from/to the stops. Also provides real time information about scheduled departures where competitors (Google Maps) do not (e.g. in Vienna) and gives you the best exits & which part of the metro/train to take to be the fastest | wonderful üôåüèæ | Reliable. | So much better than other apps to get round London. Indispensable | very helfull | buses are free in LA. we'll awesome App. | sure helped riding Phoenix metro | very good app easy to reach place help of app | useful. | Was broken on android 14 but now works perfectly again. Love this app I think it's the best transit app for use in New York. I prefer this to all the competition. | very helpful app | Not bad, relatively reliable for public transit schedules (less so during school breaks when the bus schedule changes but I think this depends on the bus company providing updates). What bothers me most is that at the end of a trip, the app does not close automatically and continues to run in the background, using phone battery. Small thing but annoying. | excellent , easy to navigate NYC using this app | Best app for public transportation navigation, easy to use and offers the best routes. | sometimes it doesn't work | So much better than Google. I have been using it since 2019 that is from my 1st day in Singapore | better than Google maps for transport links | Most used app on my phone. Really useful planning my journey and helps me save alot of time. Bus locator feature is really helpful and super convenient to use üëè | Excellent. Add more cities. | Very helpful for traveling. | This app is good, however in some cases it isn't as accurate as i'd like it to be when planning trips, but overall this app is useful, i would use it for tracking bus and train times | nice app | Great app so helpful to get around London. | Not accurate for Paris. Suggests RER route, turns out it's via metro... schedules also aren't precise. | Reliable. Great app. Prefer it to Google maps! | This app is excellent. No matter where you are or want to go. Just put it in the description, then you'll get all the routes and journey times. Every update there is an improvement. Forget Google maps, this app is more accurate, precise and easier to use. | This is the best map app out there! Thanks for never steering me wrong! | Found this while planning for a trip to NYC. Very quick and effective. Provides multiple options to get you around. I plan on leaving this on my phone for future use. | Been really great so far when I moved to Ireland and had absolutely no clue where I was going on my own, but today I've been experiencing a lag when I use the app and switch between modes like simple and walk less, maybe it's the ads, I don't know. But it's made it a bit more bothersome to use, and not as fluid anymore. Please look into this, as I love your app otherwise. Thank you for all your hard work and interest. ‚ô• | city mapper won't open anymore since I updated my android phone!!! I cleared the cache but it still won't open! | Very useful app | Great app. Would love to support it, but your club packages are far too expensive for my usage. | Efficient and very complete, switched from Google maps cause it was having issues and discovered this | Incredible amounts of different options for the route you can take to your destination!! It also includes many more routing options that other navigation apps do not. | Excellent | very helpful app | Not all time | Kinda sux but better than other navigation apps the time is kinda off and the UI is nice but can be confusing sometimes | Wish it had the AI voice to give direction when walking. | amazingly app | very accurate. easy to use. recommend to everyone | good | Doesn't register one of the train lines in Yokohama and is thus useless | decent app for London travel | nice | Why does it give me information in French? I can't change the language! So frustrating! | Better than Google maps in bigger cities when using public transport. Outside of there Waze for driving or Google maps is better. | Absolutely, the best mapper there is! | Great transit app for major cities!! | good | it's a really good app and has clear instructions on how to travel. | Very good | Very useful application | Perfect Bus checker, just what I was looking for | great | its so good and acurate | worls great üòÄ | I don't know but when you get out of the app it takes time to update your location. The course of travel is still there but would take time to update where you are. That's needs to be worked on but aside from that, the app is good. | Unreliable. Suggested routes on one day just disappear when re-running the exactly the same search later the same day. | Very good and precised information | very good app | ‚ù§Ô∏è | Cannot begin to say how much I love this app. It got me where I needed to go in Edinburgh and London. Will send you notifications. It's amazing | Wonderful app for city commute. Thank you | sometimes gives weird or not helpful routes, but overall really good app for travel in major cities. I use it almost every day | wonderful üòò many many helpful | The app has a lagtime and drops your trip randomly but every once in a while. I'd estimate 1:5, otherwise it's been perfect and don't forget the slingshot feature it's worth the experience. | I love this app. I've traveled to different cities in Europe and North America, and I have always been able to rely on Citymapper to get me where I am going. Not only that, but the multiple modes of transportation offered and real time updates make traveling public transportation immensely easier. | Best way to get around a city you are unfamiliar with!!!!. You can hardly get lost, even if you are trying!!! It gives realtime updates for NY trains and it is so convenient! I love that it offers options for getting around. I recommend the app regularly. Successful travels for NY & DC so far.... | Very good. would recommend. I love how you can customise the app logo. simple controls, travel made fun. highly accurate location. love it | Good | If you're in the UK don't waste your time if the TfL app use this instead, I've have been using this for a while and in different cities across the UK and other countries. This app works and is unequaled. | can be better hope you improve the app soon. | Excellent | works better than google in london! | This app is impeccable in every way. | Super useful!! I've used it in lnay cities (Such as Montreal and Paris) and it's always been on point. It offers a lot of different options. | good | good app | This used to be a great app but it is not showing me the fastest route anymore in the recommended section... why do i have to cycle trough different icons in order to find the route that takes me to the destination the quickest/on time. Your algorithm is broken! | it's the best app for navigation. Its makes my travel life easy as a international people | Get all the information that I need, and control the travel time & easily reach the destination of my every trip. | Can highly recommend, not let me down when travelling in unfamiliar city's | easy to use and very handy | very good | one of the most usefull app I used since i moved abroad, so helpfull to reach locations on different places | perfect | very helpful and easy to use | Simply the best city navigation map, it makes it so easy to make your way around a big city using public transport and walking. Have used it in Paris, New York, London and Bristol. The functionality is great. Highly recommend. | Always so helpful getting around in big cities!! | good | unbelievably helpful in London | don't leave home without it üòé | Great app in cities it works. I used the app in DC not long and and it was great. So I thought this app will be great on my recent trip to Bangkok, only to find this app does not work in Bangkok. Super disappointed. | Super helpful navigating buds and subway transit across a new city. The app even provides info on which exits to take from the station and which part of the train to sit in. | The best application | there is no more stops shown in city map from highwaydown to littlehampton so we need to update. | Good app | Neat little app, though I do wish it could show the buses locations in real time if possible. Also the ability to see the arrival time for walking right next to the minutes it takes to walk. | easy to use and give accurate information about your journey | Almost always shows wrong time for buses on TFL | Arrive time not update | The route screen is misleading. London Overground and Elizabeth line are not tube lines. Also, the train departure board is hard to use unlike the tube one - trains should be ideally shown in the same way as tubes and buses. | Best way to navigate New York City | very good app and also so precise | best | I used it in London and I found it extremely useful... | very accurate in its suggestions, especially with bus timings | Really bad working!! It's was really good time ago but i don't know what Change... Only i can relate that every time it have a problems online. Changing bus timing, confusing stations, ect | Awesome app . No comments. Everything is just like we want | Best app! | Good but sometimes you also need to double check | So Useful Thanks Alot City Mapper. | Better for central London / tube connected London. Could be better for South London train network - train options don't come up even if it is the shorter option because it isnt the soonest option. Train only doesnt quite hit the mark for those that take a bus first to the traon. Need a shortest journey option! Calendar event functionality used to be great but no longer works after I changed phones. | fab | I used this app for 3 months ,with my 3 children we missed buses so many times and because it always gave wrong time ,we waited so many times in bus stops . The WORST APP so far ,from it gave wrong arrival time , I deleted it now | Helps me get wherever I'm going, whatever city I'm in. And many different options. It's great | awesome üëçüòé | Must have travel app, the quickest way to find and track your journeys | very helpful","{""1"":10849,""2"":0,""3"":0,""4"":40685,""5"":221735}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†39.00 - CZK¬†2,490.00 if billed through Play","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Citymapper Limited","7691438629453514158","support@citymapper.com","http://citymapper.com","Ground Floor

I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations.

I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry.

But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selecci√≥n). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change.

Not Good for the World community | Still my favorite travel site, but it seems not to have the number of specials from years past. Good people's when contacted, which is exactly what I've always liked about they're site! | great App | I tried this app once to book car rental and for some reasons the pick-up and drop-off time were pre-set to 12nn and can't be changed, we decided to book anyway. It turned out that the car rental shop closed at 12nn and we were not able to get our car but still got charged for the rental plus insurance. We also learned that Kayak outsources rental to yet another 3rd party/middleman company and getting a refund is next to impossible. Just book directly, don't use this app. | kayak is the best.. more places to choose from.. | okay for flight simulations | Rental car is scam | this app used to be better before the pandemic but now it's not the same. | Great app. it offers the best and cheapest flights | really good | Lowest price hotel was triple other sites, also would only allow up to 4 guests in a room where others have allowed 6 as we required. | Cool concept, but when it told me $1800 for a ticket I can buy directly from United for $900 for the exact same flight, I lost all confidence that I'm getting the best price when using the app. | The app deceives people, you can buy tickets cheaper on other websites. I was looking at tickets from London to Istanbul. They sell a ticket for ¬£192, but Pegasus sells it for ¬£113 for the same days and times. Same airport and airlines üòÅ | I Love It.Donna Spinner | Since I have installed your app, I have used only one time. And the reason is, because when I try to find more affordable tickets your green date are often more expansive then orange and red one's. I wander why.. | Now that Expedia and Booking have bought every competitor all of these great old sites / apps like Kayak are worthless.

I've never booked any flights or hotels so I can't say how good that aspect of the app is. However I've had no issues with the flight tracker, and more often than not, kayak updates any delays before the actual airport.

Personalization of design could be improved | so far so good | I dont see any benefit to pro. It seems a lot to pay just for flight notifications. We already get that from the airline. I would like to be able to add more than 3 photos/pdf so that everything is in one place. It's a little archaic not to. Also, it's a trip planner, add a packing list. Again, so it's all in one place. This is my 1st time using this app and I'm travelling in 11 days. I'll edit when I return! | ""Error: saving failed. Please try again"". CONSTANTLY. Duplicating plans to different trips changes the trips' dates automatically, even after editing the duplicated plan to reflect new dates. Mass-editing still not possible after a decade plus. Amateurish effort and a childish attempt by intuit to hoover data. | Paid for the Pro which has some benefits like adding travel documents and updated gate alerts, but whenever my airline sends me updated flight times (which seems to be frequent) , it adds the updated flight as a new flight and then I don't know which leg of each trip is the new or old and I have to delete the whole trip and start new. Very frustrating. Updated to add it used to be better at forwarding emails and automatically inputting information. Half the time they go to unfiled documents now | Great way to organize a trip with multiple people planning, numerous hotels and stops, and flying more than one airline. | great app for planning | If you travel for business or pleasure, this would be a very useful addition. It take organizing to a new level. | soooo handy, highly recommended | Excellent travel companion. The stuff you need, in a simple presentation, and that's it. | fab app to get all your travel plans organised and in one place | Awesome | Perfect for long trips, especially when a lot can change üôÇ. | A great place to hold all the details of your trip. | I've been using this app for 13 years and I find it to be one of the most useful apps on my phone. I'm planning another trip and Tripit correctly and safely stores my itinerary. Love it. | Super helpful and easy to use. Everything in one place, straight from your mails, no need to do much. | so easy to use and a great, clear itinerary display | very good tool to manage trips and hwt regular updates | trip it keep all the travel and hotels together. Very practical. | Tripit Pro is the best way to get organized and then stay dynamically organized as your trip progresses. | I have used TripIt for multiple trips, and I appreciate how it keeps us on track with our schedule. I also like that I can share the itenary with others. I would, however, like to see both a start and end time on the main page. | it's a great traveling tool. | Fun to track it all. | Doesn't connect to email like it used to. Harder to use. Used to so smooth and seemless, not anymore. | I love having all of my reservations in one place with addresses, reservation numbers, contact info and anything I could need while traveling. I can also share the itinerary with people that are traveling with me. | Have used and loved it for years. In 2024 the airport maps no longer display but give an error message saying there is a bug. Very inconvenient. Deducted a star. | great app!!! very useful to organize your trip!!!!! | For hotels during the trip, the timeline view only shows the start and end day of the accommodation. We need to show our colleagues ""where to stay"" each day after a busy day full of events. This was requested since 2016 and still not considered in a so called ""trip planner"" app. Any project planner like MS planner, Trello can easily duplicate the element and distribute them on each day as a column. Optionally, a packing list should be made available as a trip planner | Very useful information in one place. | great app | Useless, unless you pay for a subscription | Does the basics and allows to better organize a trip for easier visualisation, but could use some improvements. - Interface is OK but not great. It can be a bit confusing to use at first. - Does not allow to share trips with friends for reasons unclear that even support can't say. - I considered the pro version but I can't really understand what the benefits are apart from flight notifications, which I already get with my airline app for free. | Excellent app | Won't sync with outlook | Great, except the incorrect time display | Unable to create account. Keep getting ""use a strong password"" message when my password is 14 characters long with upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Frustrating. | Love how it organises everything for you. | I use Tripit for ongoing and complex trips lasting 6 months and more. It is a really good tool for identifying errors in my booking process. | it keeps surprising with features that pop up that I really appreciate | loving the simplicity and organization | so helpful | Can't connect to travel partners. Entering account information for car rental accounts, hotel accounts, and airline miles accounts is useless. TripIt doesn't effectively sync with any of them to pull current rewards information. | only with limited photos to upload | Really great way to keep all dates and bookings in one place and to share with multiple group members. | This app is awesome! It keeps all of my itinerary in one place. It even gives a safety score for where you're staying. Perfect job | Regularly logs you out and hangs when doing offline syncing so had to uninstall it as of March 2024 | Where has this been all my life??? | just downloaded. just what I was looking for | Invaluable tool for any traveler. | wowwwww, its a powerful tool üòé | The app will not let me sign in. It's tells me my password isn't valid. But I can log in on a browser with that password so clearly it is the right password. This is insane. | I have been using for years. very convenient to have your flights, hotels, trips etc all in one place. | The best travel management app I've ever used had only one issue (processing non English bookings). Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred... What if this happened during trip? Useless app.... Uninstalled... Resolved previous issues. Apparently my device was updating apps at the time and a glitch occurred when I tried to log in to TripIt. After updates completed, I was able to change my password and update my trip information. Apologies to team TripIt. | Amazing app | I love how it creates your trip schedule so easily! | easy to organize complete trips | Great app to plan your trip. Gets updated from your email confirmations automatically so you have all your trip info in one place | Love how helpful status updates are! Best travel planner! | will let know once | great way to keep all of your travel information in one place. | awesome travel organizer | I think this is a scam it asks you for your date of birth and where U live straight away and it barely made any plans for me I had to do it myself and you have too pay $80 a year | I really love having this app. It helped me plan my recent trip to Canada. I haven't had to pay anything to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential. If you could export to a cvs or cvv for spreadsheet that would be amazing | New version won't let me sign in. | Very helpful while travelling , and you have a busy schedule | ever since giogle stopped trips, I have been lost. trip-it saved me | Lets have an app scan your entire mailbox for 'just your travel data' aha ... Because that's bound to end well, with the inevitable data breach... | Works well. Easy to use. | excellent | ‚ù§Ô∏è | Doesn't work at all anymore. Can't even login, keeps giving me an error | great | Must improved since last I rated it two stars in 2017. It however has slipped again. My properly imported rental car plans always randomly change between filed and unfiled. This makes things difficult when using the widgets | Too many bugs | Great for documenting your confirmations for airline, car rentals, dinner reservations, but not for planning a trip. I was hoping this app would replace Roadtrippers for me. | used it once before and found it again. worth the money for the pro version | Love the fact that you can make a very detailed itinarary with a visual timeline that makes it easy to keep track of everything. | THE BEST travel organiser app. | Best app üëå | Everything I book or event attended is added to Tripit for future reference. | Very helpful in keeping track of everything on a trip in terms of flight status and hotel confirmation. I've been using it for years and never had any problems. | Impressive but not perfect. Need to add feature of more than one email address because not all my travel info goes to the same email address. | The app has been great but just stopped working. When I try to log in it just says access denied | great product keeping all travel details together | No search function (iOS has it). Flighty level details would be nice. They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world üåé and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers. | Hello. I can't invite participants via email. A message appears that the requested email cannot be attached at this time. The point is that there are emails with which there is no problem and there are those that do. I did a few tries and it seems to be completely random. There was an attempt with two emails that managed to connect and the second time, with the same two emails, I couldn't. How can it be fixed? | Excellent! | make my travel easier | The pro version is a must for frequent travelers - it makes your travel logistics much smoother! Basic things like letting you know gates changes to baggage pickup carousel numbers before airlines / FIDs can. Subscription cost paid for it self for me when it alerted me when a cheaper rate rate on same flight came up, with clear instructions on how to secure. It worked and saved me hundreds for our family vacation! Update: now saved my thousands over the years with the Fare Tracket! | Good yahha | Great . | it's very easy to use and links easily to trips. but I can't seem to set custom picture for trips which isn't great. I tried following their directions but it still doesn't work. | Keeps on signing me out and then having to reset my password and won't let me sign in on more than one device which is a pity as the app looks good | love it!! | Extremely helpful | The application is excellent, but unfortunately, I have encountered a technical issue where it repeatedly crashes. | The app will not let me log in. I Created a password but the app freezes when I tap the submit button. | App was recently updated and google login no longer works in app (does in website). | cool travel üß≥ app | Useless | such a great app. we travel a lot and it's indispensible | My flight on American Airlines was delayed twice and AA rebooked me on a different connection, but TripIt Pro never updated my itinerary, even many hours later. | Live & die by this app for travel, domestic & international. I've been using the app for over a decade. | does has list of all the cities and station in India | Very useful for trip planning!!! | Could be better | Love this app, mad glitchy though. Only thing is, when you share the itinerary with someone's email some details are left out. And they can only get an updated list of plans if you resend it via email or download the app. | Upgraded to the newest version and my past & future trips that were in the system have all disappeared. Have had multiple issues logging in from the mobile app, it opens the login into a browser then doesn't connect after entering all login info. | Crashes and does not save the IT I was trying to add. | Verry bad | 1-2024, keep getting denied access from phone and laptop. 11-2022 Not saving any itineraries correctly and supper buggy; keeps crashing. When it works it's great üëç | I have two long trips coming up, each involving a couple of train journeys and a couple of ferries. It got the dates right for one of them, and was off by a year for the other. It didn't pick the ferries up at all, and only found one of the train journeys. I'll stick with paper printouts. | For some reason, the app does not open and does not load once I enter my username and password; I can only use it on the website not on the app ; I have a Xiaomi 12 Pro. | App crahsing | I'm unable to sign into the app. I can sign into the desktop version. however, when I try signing in via the app it says ""an unexpected error has occured"". | Super helpful. | Horrible customer service!!! (or lack of) have deleted it after three emails with tech issues and no one getting back | Very handy app, the import function via email works well. Would be good if you could show a trip as cancelled status but leave it in the list so you can keep the details for future reference. | a great way to organize your trips. super easy to use and convenient | excellent app for keeping itineraries, tickets, bookings ect. | I love how easy it is to find all my travel info. Trip it not only automatically pulls the relevant info, but it also organizes my trip into an itinerary. My husband and I both use the app, and since he travels for work a lot, he can just forward info, and it gets organized by TripIt, and I can access it if necessary. | Don't waste your time with this one. It's a pay yearly at a very high price. Save the the money for your trip, there are better apps out there. | best travel app ever | very convenient aop! | Lousy app | Can't install nor update in Japan | Keeps crushing on a galaxy s22 ultra. On Huawei 30 pro works and I like it | This app has been very helpful in keeping track of my travel plans. I've only used the free version so far but will probably upgrade in the future | going to be using it on upcoming family vacation. Used it for a mini vacation and I never lost track of our plans and tickets or even confirmation numbers. I need more reference to give it any higher or lower of a review. | Free and works reasonably well. But too many trips are not automatically uploaded and I need to do it manually (even from main travel agencies like Expedia). 3 stars because it's free, otherwise it would be a 2. | I've used Tripit for years, mostly because there was no alternative. (1) It looks like with Tripit Pro you must have auto renewal -- no way to remove credit card so you must manually close Pro account. (2) No ability to add expense items during trip.

All other booking websites show total cost of stay, but hostel world shows cost per night, and sneakily adds in additional taxes etc. Figuring out amount owing on arrival is also difficult, because the cost summary is displayed in 3 different currencies (home currency, local currency and USD). overall pretty deceptive, obviously aimed at creating the illusion that a place is cheaper than it is. | Ariff sayang ibu dan ayah. | Doesnt seem to support the chat feature on a samsung a32 there were many messages from other travellers I would have liked to see but it was on a non stop buffer | It's a great app for connecting people | easy to use | My first time and will see how it is going | nice app | I don't understand why I can't pay with PayPal üò≠üò≠üò≠ | Good service. | Die neue Version sieht vielleicht etwas besser aus, aber leider ist sie deutlich schlechter in der benutzerfreundlichkeit. Die Informationen sind einfach nicht klar und deutlich dargestellt und sehr verwirrend. Leider ein R√ºckschritt. Update 04/24: Ich bekomme eine Mail, das ich meine Zahlungsdaten updaten soll. In der App keine Spur zu finden. | The idea is good but the app is very basic and slow | You are great! | nice options | Helps me travel without worry | Really time consuming ..trying to cancel a booking. No Customer Service ..kinks sent that don't work | Terrible application and company. An hostel listed on their APP stole 120,10‚Ç¨ from me 4 months ago. I've talked with 4 different customer service representatives without any proper help. Horrific. Never use their services. Book everywhere else, not with Hostelworld. | Easily the best App to find a place to stay anywhere. Love it!! | To select birthday, need to scroll 120 times for ten years of my life. Then times that by 7 !! And it can't recognize by bank card | best price | The app in itself is good, but the performance and interface is terrible. It crashes all the time, and I cannot log in to my account, even though in the website I have already logged in to make a reservation. | Non-functional in almost every way. Crashes constantly, wipes anything you have typed if you put it in the background, brings up wrong cities, brings up blank pages after typing in a specific city, functions at half the speed of the browser version. Pretty much pointless to have on your phone. | Fabulous | So many memories | It requires international transaction | I feel cheated. No taxes included, and then you get slapped with a higher price than expected. Not happy at all. | great location, near Union station. most all stuff is walkable nice clean joint, big / lots of rooms. accommodating & friendly staff. | Great | Money deducted and booking done in sold out hostel and cancellation done just before arrival. Pathetic portal and service | Great place to find the perfect accommodation for your destination and needs at nice low rates. | I want to remove my pre-filled in credit card details but it is not possible, please fix this to make the app more secure | Rko | HostelWorld sells overbooked hostels that are sold out and than doesn't even respond back to return the money. The 'Booking' app has always emailed me back immediately. HostelWorld also does not care if their vendors constantly charge more for their rooms despite it being priced differently on their app. 1 star for stealing peoples money and not emailing back on MULIPLE occasions. | The idea behind the app is good, the implementation is decent. Looks like a MVP generated by a small startup, has minimal functionalities, can't put payment details from the app, no customer support, no information about payments | they don't publish honest reviews when terrible experiences are had by clients. They also don't do anything about the bad experiences and don't hold their hostels accountable. | Good üòÉ | A hostelworld error caused me to lose money. The response from the customer service was as if its my fault and they made out that I should be greatful for a small amount of the money I lost, back. I responded and have not received a response back. Really bad from hostelworld, makes me not want to book through them again. I lost two nights worth of money and it ruins my travel plans as I have to stay here now because of being charged twice. Wouldn't refund 1 night to stop me being charged twice. | great way to find nice hostels in Japan. haven't tried it elsewhere yet. | Great choice | just joined. so far so good | Unable to view any previous trips, leave reviews or use the chat function. Disappointed. | great value ! nice people | Don't recommend | Very creative mind to let people socialize. very innovative thinking, should bring more similar initiatives. Good job | Easy to use | Works well. I can quickly book a night on the spot around. Great value for a backpack trip in Japan. | Nice but seems more expensive than Booking, also no fidelity program ! | No use (don't know if it's temporary issue/permanant one). App is not able to book hostels in Iran. | works fast, plenty of options. I still don't try the customer service. | That is perfectly | A very easy way to book a hostel and have some recommendations | European university of germany location | this is scam app . I booked through it and they took 10$ and gave me confirmation however I contacted the owner he informed me that there is no confirmation and not available and he told me I have to book through other websites! scamm scammmm scamm ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | Favorite app for hostels for sure. Love the Hostelworld fam! | the best deals ever!!! love it | It's ok and provides a decent amount of hostels. However, when I try to give a review I am getting an error and cannot submit it. So, I would not trust the reviews. Check trip advisor or other platforms before booking. Or use a different one altogether | one of the best app that help me when i travel and they have amazing stuff | Great app! | they lay out things very easy and the app is highly efficient and intuitive with easy ways to change currency and so on. usually find the best prices here too :) | Can't favourite hostels? Hostels appear in an order (paid for?) | One of the kind it is a perfect app | so excited | The app is easy to use and all the info I need is provided. plus, I love the convenience to cancel our change dates if necessary. | I always had nice experience in these hostels!! | efficient booking system | horrible | I used this app a lot, but now they run so many annoying ads on YouTube I decided to use competition instead. | 5-‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Five Stars | good but annoying I keep getting adverts to use Hostelworld when I already use it lol. algo is messed up | Great information | I've traveled around the world for years, and this app has been absolutely necessary | very useful | App for hostel lovers and travellers | great | Tuve que cancelar una reservaci√≥n a causa de la cancelaci√≥n de un vuelo y no me devolvieron el dep√≥sito que hab√≠a ya pagado con mi tarjeta de cr√©dito a hostelworld... Muy mal que al cancelar la reserva no reembolsen el dinero.... | No longer worth getting a hostel when they cost as much or more than a hotel. Plus more are moving to piece meal microtransactions which ruin the experience. | good | the site keeps having problems with credit card payments. seems like something you'd want to fix | easy to use plus so many options & information | I decided to delete app after downloading but the deletion process is really long and not friendly at all. There is no need to do it such long, please don't play with people's nerves and accounts/data. Thanks. | Excellent app for booking hostels. | Very nice application for hostels | love it! convenient and easy | Cool and easy app to use, but customer support is very shifty, you can't call them and have to go trough a long procedure to finally kinda get in contact and have to wait 10 hours for a response. In my case that was terrible, I accidentally booked twice because I didn't receive any confirmation the first time and the second time was the day of planned arrival in the hostel, if there was a warning or something, hey you already booked or hey, you wouldn't be able to cancel, but no nothing. | Godsend for solo travellers | easy to use and intuitive | By far the best app for booking hostels while travelling/backpacking. literally a must-download if you travel. | No longer able to see Linkups without booking the specific hostel. Being able to see linkups was a very useful feature to decide which hostel to book. | Fake app. I made a reservation but on reaching the hotel they said they were not even aware of an app/site called Hostelworld. I paid an amount for pre booking and there is ZERO customer support. Looters. | Thank you very much and useful ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞ | I've used hostel world 4 times this year.the app is easy to use I've never had any problems with hostel world . until COVID they took 2 years to give me my deposit back. | always my best choice with hostelworld | Booked a hostel that wasn't even available, but it still showed up on hostelworld. I was turned away at checkin, but this company kept my deposit and refused to refund me | so far so good | This app looks very pretty on the surface, but it can't even find most of the US cities (large and small) that I enter into the destination box. It would be a very good idea to work on this issue if you want anyone to use it! | Great app that makes searching and booking easier! It also allows you to meet with other people in chats beforehand. I absolutely love this app and use it whenever I solo travel. Heck, some of these places, I'd even have a friend book their own stay with me! So worth it for socialization. You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you! | Easy and fast. | great app :) | Been using this app and website forever. It's never let me down. | Generally works fine,the discounts for the hostels seem quite good. Would be better if this could work offline just in case I don't have an internet. I'm happy with the app, allows me to go places I couldn't afford otherwise, especially in expensive cities like Dublin and London. Also only some hotels can be paid partly by card and the rest by cash on the spot. | Bad experience with no support I paid the advance of the booking for you The rest of the payment didnt want to proceed and its not my fault No support from you or from the hostel neither Anyway it was just an advance of 25‚Ç¨ but believe me you lost a client I dont recommend this app | Efficient and reliable - typically has cheaper pricing than I can find elsewhere | good app for Booking premium hostels | Hostelworld does not care about the safety of travelers at all. As long as they get money, they do not care if the hostel is safe or responsive. | Best App | Have found so many great hostels thru this app! The reviews are usually quite trustworthy | They don't help you if you cancel a reservation because you discover the hostel is lying on pictures | No CT locations | App didn't work. I tried to log in with 3 different browsers, but it just keeps hanging instead of logging me in. Total waste of my time. | worst service. They took my booking. when I reached hotel. hotel cancelled booking and denied room. In this situation Hostel world customer care did not respond to my mails or call. they took payment in dollors. My money also not refunded | weee | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Great app for finding affordable places to stay around the world. My go to as a budget traveler. | Unusable. Installed app to try out the chat/social features, since to book I just use website. After the log in screen it sits loading forever. | Easy :) | Absolutely unreliable. I make a hostel reservation, I am charged the pre-payment from my bank account, and then I am informed by the hostel (not Hostelworld) that my booking with them is not valid. I contact Hostelworld's customer care and ask why my booking apparently has been cancelled. I receive NO reply or explanation, only an automated e-mail saying my Hostelworld booking has been cancelled. Nothing about the fact that I should get my ‚Ç¨20.09 pre-payment back! I am massively disappointed. | simple, very easy to use. quick way to book | easy to use | perfect | Great experience ... | I love it. | Ok | ok | great services | It's a world wide party, lots of ladys | it works | doesnt remember date selected | Lame gukuss | Site etc is fine. But app missing features. You can't see distance by current location. You can't hide female only rooms. Basic things for travellers | My favorite Hostel booking app! | I went last year the location was amazing amazing the staff they are super nice and the breakfast was so yummy that's why I booked again this year | very good apps | IT didn'tüö´seem to like my credit cardsüëéüèª‚ÄºÔ∏è | Booking Cancelled without intimation. We had to again look for different Hotels for stay. | excelente | Lost nearly $300 because Hostelworld refuses to take responsibility for the hostels they support. I've complained several times about a particular hostel (because my experience was awful), and they have done absolutely nothing about it. That hostel is still listed. I used to love the Hostelworld platform, but I think I will make the effort to contact hostels directly now instead. Also, the Share Your Trip feature hasn't worked for the last several stays. | Please update your app it's unable to fatch my location nither able to search any place. Useless aap. | I have found multiple amazing hostels through here and highly recommend this app. | wonderful üòòüòä | I'm unable to view my past bookings | Searching for locations doesn't work | Thank you the ease of an experience to book my reservation online (Theough the app). | Horrible App. Pricey. Plus they lie offering 75% discount. | This is one of the most user friendly hotel booking app I have ever used. Pretty budget friendly booking too. | wow the best app | good app | Good site but dependant on price from other sites + or -. I don't know why when it's a hostel site it has expensive hotels and some hostels above other site prices!? | muy Bien | great app to book | Pretty good, seems cheaper than others? | incredible app, works around the world | Broken app and website. The production URL for logging in seems failing everywhere. Unable to login during crucial time during VISA process | Everything is easy and flawless | great plate-forme | tight af | Does not work as expected. Uninstalling, moving on. | easy to use and love the layout/aesthetic! | grate app. .you get tips and honest feed back from people who where actually there. not the company painting a facility that's probably not honest about the .accommodation. don't get me wrong some people give bad reviews on some stuff. that's its kinda pity. but this app helps a ton.! I been using it for years! cheers and safe travels. | easy to use. reviews are very informative. respects privacy by not sending spam email. | Nice Application | It's Nice. | easy | Very good app | does not list all available properties in the area | Plenty of options for accomodation. üòÉ | My favorite resource for finding truthful reviews on hostels. | When I used this app previously, meaning years ago, I would reserve a room or a bed somewhere, pay 15 or 20% of the total price of my stay and then pay the rest when I finally arrived at the hostel. This seems to have changed. I just reserved a bed in Vienna, I was charged a part of the total price as usual but then the rest was charged from my credit card the next day. If that's the way this service works now, then I have no use for it. | I've had a glitch happen where the selected dates shift by one day after I press search. | Nice app , made my trips cheap , I had the opportunity to know new people explore different cultures without paying crazy moneys on hotels. What could be done to make this app a better experience ? Plan to disactive memberships on of some of the hostels that has constant bad reviews over the years . some hostels become not available because they have been filled with long term living people , I hope you can find a way to mention this in your app . | Why did this app never show up on my recent apps? Very annoying | Best deal for short stay | Account password reset emails are not being sent to all email providers and customer care is useless. | very helpful | I can't get help to fix a extra debit in my account | good | Worst customer service ever, I wanted to get the information for the booking, The agent named with Hevandro disconnected my chat 3 times by saying all the best. I have chat transcript. It was really unprofessional and first and last experience with Hostelworld. | DO NOT BOOK THROUGH HOSTELWORLD. This company allowed us to book a hostel that they no longer worked with so when we showed up late at night the hostel has no recognition of our booking. The booking was showing in the app under upcoming trips until a few hours before where it disappeared in the app to the cancelled bookings which neither us or the hostel cancelled. We are now over ¬£800 out of pocket and trying to get in touch with someone from Hostelworld is near impossible. | not trustable, only works when they felt fine to do it | We're going o | No ability to give negative reviews to places, i got scamed by a place they charged me full price after i canceled 1 month in advance even though the policy says you can cancel 1 week earlier and they only charge the reservation fee | somany hidden charges | My experience with using Hostelworld has been great. Both the hostels I stayed at were really nice places and a highlight of my mumbai trip. | Great app to find hostels buuuut many of the reviews for the properties are fake. 5 stars of they could verify the reviews that are genuine. | Used to be good but now full of scammy bot reviews, also another loop hole where the host can cancel your booking once you have got there and paid so you are unable to leave a legitimate review. A real shame cause this used to be good, never again hostelworld been burnt too many times now. | Will NOT help in the case of their own app preventing cancellation. You must reach out to the accomodation on your own | Amazing Service! | Avoid, complete scam. | I have been charged twice for same booking. I already sent email to both hostel andnhostelworld.. unfortunately, i m not getting any reply and for irony hostelworld says query solved.... Very unfortunate and pathetic... Intersting there are hidden charges by hostelworld around 20 euros. Which were no where mentioned during booking | We are living our second youth. we are a bit older and have had nothing but great luck with Hoatelworld | Terrible application. Cannot find any cities unless it is the capital or a popular tourist destination. It has very few hostels compared to reality which limits a lot the choices you have if you don't look elsewhere. | very very good | Sometimes the price is not the best one, but is useful | The only good thing about this app is the in-app chat group. But many times it doesn't work or allowing users to access the group | This site/app only accepts international transactions. it doesn't accept Indian currency | The customer service of Hostelworld seems to be unreachable. I wanted to create an account to cancel my booking and that didn't work. Tried reaching out via mail but haven't received a reply in 5 days. | Double price on arrival. I booked online and the price showed $29 dollars cad including taxes. I sat on a bus for 6 hours with no air conditioning finally got to the hostel at night and after going through all the check in procedures they let me know the taxes added up to an additional $20 dollars! This app was good but apparently it's a scam now. I talked to the hostel and they said oh it's in the fine print.

There are few minor glitches, the map adds air travel routes when none were taken, easily removed. Highly recommend if you are travelling. | The first time I am following someone, I like it. I'm going to use it on my next trip too. | Great app, a good way of keeping track of our journeys! | Love the app | The one thing that would make this app better is being able to tag other users in steps. It would add a whole new dimension and be a nice way to keep track of people you meet during your travels. | Start using your app, following some friend's travel almost on-time experience! The only problem I'm facing is that most of my followers are French & Spanish...and there is NO choice to have posts translated automatically! This option would save me time translating & sending my travel spots by other means... Another hic...replying direct to a comment is not personalized and looks confusing on the follow-up threads. Well overall good...need some ergonomic updates, so eagerly waiting for it... | Fantastic app to track your travels. Easy to use platform. | Absolutely cool app for travel and staying connected. | We have been an early adopter and really like it for tracking all if our travels. A must have app! | Great App, with accurate location it's only downfall is lack of animation (like Travelboast) once trip is complete | I have logged many trips over several years. Those photo journals are most precious possessions. Easy to use. And the printed books are worth it. | Very great app! Only thing that could improve is connecting 2 phones to 1 account and save drafts online so the other device can edit/add photos without posting them first. | Fanastic way to save memories in a chronological order | Great ap, especially the map | An excellent way of following friends and family on their adventures! | A great little app to record & share your travels. | Fabulous way to flow my friends trip. Now I am keen to use it myself. Easy to follow. | Excellent app, useful to keep family up to date and keep a record of your travels to fondly look back on later | Loving the way I can share my travels with friends and family | Great record of trips with photos and stories that is shareable. | Lovely way to record a journey. Nice features and easy to use, love that you can see on a map where you went. Will use again! | Easy to use . | Great travel app covering all your journey. | S'il y a bien une application √† avoir pendant un voyage, c'est celle ci ! ü´∂ Nous voyageons partout dans le monde et cette application nous motive √† √©crire et photographier quotidiennement ! En revanche, les suggestions de voyage ne sont pas suffisamment mises √† jour, beaucoup de voyages ne sont plus d'actualit√© et datent d'il y a plusieurs ann√©es... Vous pouvez suivre notre tour du monde en stop ici : MarineSamuelTravel | Excellent üëç | Great app to keep family and friends posted and also allows you to print your album | excellent app, love it for its functionality and easy use | It has been great at helping me keep connected to my daughter while she is travelling | Pretty good needed a bit more help learning to navigate the app | Enjoyable and for my level of requirement its just brilliant | Love it, easy to use. | Great app, good to see where you've been. | Great travel app. | Great app not only for the journey you are on, but also for recording your holiday retrospectively. | Great to follow friends' holiday | Great to | I like that it has privacy settings and is relatively easy to use. However, it is not always clear for those receiving the trip updates how to access it. | I'm watching my god daughter travelling and loving the updates | But does it have a wiggle effect so I can find ez | Simple, hugely useful and aesthetic | Beautiful app. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. prefer an option to convert a future planned trip to a past trip. It doesn't let you do that manually and only does it on its own when the travel tracker is switched on. If the phone battery ends, nothing can be done. The travel tracker creates its own steps instead of converting my planned steps. Also the past trip doesn't let you add number of nights stayed at a place. It doesnt let you select mode of travel - plane | Brilliant. | Polarsteps let's us record our trips across Europe whilst also allowing friends and families to follow what we are doing. We and our friends and families do love it | Brilliant app | It's a nice way to share travel experiences with friends and family. | Love this app. My family back home had peace of mind while I was travelling and could see everything I was doing! So easy to use as well! | We use since a few months and are very pleased by it. Our friends love to follow our adventures, when they have time and want to. | Great to share experience with family and friends | I love this app... I use it often. | Very nice | Great way to keep up to date with my boyfriend on his 6 month sabbatical. Some super cool, lovely interface features! Excited to start my blog properly soon too! | Daughter uses polar steps and so do I its a good app to see where people are | Great app, really easy to use and its such a nice way to track my travel | Pleasant experience | Fabulous app for recording holidays, sharing with friends and family | A great app to keep a record and pictures of the trips we do. It's easy to use and can be shared with friends as you travel. | Fabulous to track travels and keep photo record and memories of places you have been | Love the app. Works great. Good way to record our trips and share with family. | Great app, very impressed with it | It would be nice if every attached picture might have an own description. It would be also nice if the whole route might be exported into gpx format. And it would be nice if Polarsteps map finds small villages or places too. At the moment it doesn't. | First time of using - Fabulous | Easy to use, fun, works well | Good quality | A 'new' user of Polarsteps. Been great to use...navigate around. | Very good so far | Easy to use. Great way to keep pictorial and journal records of trips | I feel like I'm on the journey too. | Useful for keeping a record of a trip. Helps others to share your adventure. | Great way to follow the adventures of our son | Very difficult to delete, set dates, can't delete steps and try again, stuck in a loop of ""trip overlaps another' that I cant delete. Really user unfriendly, a help page would be great. | Een super app om reisverhalen op te schrijven. Het is een fijne manier om alle vrienden en familieleden op de hoogte te houden. Helaas is het nog niet mogelijk om met twee accounts een gedeelde reis te maken, dat zou een fijne toevoeging zijn. | G√©nial pour partager ses photos de voyage en temps ( presque) r√©el ! | Absolutely Fabulous! | Love this app! | Great app, highly recommend | Good tracking app | I am not tech smart, and it was easy enough for me. It guided me on each step of set-up, and let me journal the highlights easily. | Excellent way to track your journey üëå | Great app, easy to use keeping family and friends updated on your whereabouts. | Used this app to record our 2 year trip across Canada. Great to save memories of where we had been and what we had seen. Also great to share it with friends and family so they could see our adventures. It's a bit spotty when you loose signal and have to put pins in manually but 9 times out of 10 it does a perfect job. | Amazing experience. To be able to track the movements of our travellers was a real gift. | Polarsteps make it very easy to keep track of your trip and is really easy to use. I'm not particularly tech-savvy but figured everything out with no problems. I haven't made a travel book yet, but still value having the trips to look back on in Polarsteps. I also enjoy following my friends and family on their trips, fun to see where they are, and also great to see places for your own future trips. | My favorite travel-app. Tracking works well and reliable, i even could show a hiking route in a remote area. | Brilliant app - tracking, photos and comments. Just what I needed for my cycle journey along the Silk Road. | Good app üëç | Great app, I used it to track my stops from my Asia trip | Easy to navigate good ti see the maps etc fir more perspective | Great way to document our trips away and share with family and friends. | Love being able to follow our Dutch friends as they travel across America. | Took me a little while to get used to it, but I am enjoying it more and more. My family and friends back home are enjoying it as well. | Fabulous App. It makes recording your journey and letting family and friends know where you are so easy. | Une superbe application pour garder les meilleurs souvenirs de nos voyages point par point üëå | I really love the simplicity of use and richness of information. Love that there is a map tracker and you can always adjust according to what you want. It's intuitive, practical, clean, interactive. Top! | I found the app excellent, although it took me a day or two to fully get to grips with the way it operates - I guess I was being nervy that I might lose my input. After that it was plain sailing and it all worked perfectly. Feedback from friends and family about daily updates was also very positive. I fully recommend this (and the book we bought) and will certainly use it again future trips. | Love this tracker app really easy to use | great app! Wonderful way to track your vacation fun in one place and not being forced to post it to social media | Love this for tracking our journeys | Very convenient way of documenting your holiday instead of using a travel diary to remember what you did on what day etc. | App loads forever (when internet connection is stable) | Good app | 2nd trip using the app. Very useful for me to keep track of where we are going and where we have been | Great app. Have used it for several trips! | I love to follow my friends and familie travels. | Started a trip across Europe a few weeks ago and the app has enabled family and freinds back home to follow our adventures... and we love the track it makes across the globe. SO easy to use, edit, upload pics and videos.... just BRILLIANT!! | Great tool | i'm already on high accuracy mode but it still gives me long straight lines.. | Great for travelling | Brilliant app! Sharing and tracking works perfectly, and much safer to be able to share with specific family and friends knowing its not visible to the world. Looking forward to seeing how the auto-phkto album works out too. Great app, highly recommended. | Edit: Can you allow travelers to write a description under a picture one by one, someone uploaded a picture from a great restaurant or a great place but i wouldn't know it's details üíî nevertheless ,i never ever thought i would like travel trackers apps, but this!!!! omg, i am in love nowü•π | Great app to track details of trips | Great App to diarise your travels and add photos to share with family and friends. They produce an album for you at the end of the trip or it's so much easier to produce one yourself. My family use it every trip. | I haven't posted anything but the posts come through well for those I follow. My only criticism would be that the notification is a bit hit and miss! Sometimes I get a notification and other times I don't.... | Love the app as it enables me to relive my voyage one day at a time. | Great | üëçüèº | Fantastic App. Highly recommend | Love it - easy to use, and helps create a cool story | Love this appüòç | A great way to record your trip.. | Love it! Great usability, simple navigation. | My son is traveling. It's great app for us to see what he is doing. | Easy to use and a great to record your travels. | I love the app and it works great generally. I am documenting a year long journey and i can recommend it! Ome issue ive started to have recently is that it wont log me in and gives me an error. Sometimes its a few days like that before it works again. What causes this? It makes it hard to document my steps at the moment. | Love using this app to see other people's journeys and to diarise ours. Easy to use. | I have loved writing my steps down in this app , can't wait to get my thialand trip printed up in a book too , my only trouble is half my family and friends won't download the app to follow me , but hay ho who cares x | Great application, have been using it and I love it. They should add a feature for when you travel in group, we all want the journey on our profile and we have to duplicate the work. Hope to see that soon, I'll give 5 stars. | The app is great and easy to use. However, pictures and videos load very slowly (especially videos). Videos load slowly for us users and to our shared recipients. Please improve your video load time. | Absolutely fantastic app. I downloaded this app for our 7 and half month Europe campervan adventure. Its tracking our every move and displaying it on a map, exactly what we wanted. You can mark places you've stopped/visited etc and then publish it, which means it's saved. You can also add photos if you wish. Thank you for a fantastic app. | Very cool app, exactly what I was looking for! The only thing it's missing is the ability to have a collaborative trip, where you can add other people to it, and you can all add pictures and notes to the trip! Like a shared album. - that would be next level! | I have already printed four albums from my trips and I am about to order the fifth one. It's really easy to use and it's the perfect way to remember your trips. | Great app to keep a little travelblog for your loved ones back home. It tracks where you've been on the minute. You can add steps every so many minutes, great when you want to add a little sidenote in-between. The post and comment sections work just like any social media platform. Edit: One thing I would have actually liked to see added is the ability to like comments. (i.e. having a (select) option of emoji's to react to comments directly, instead of having to add a comment yourself) | I would give it a 10 stars if I could. Such a good idea, to collect all your travel memories in obe spot | Extreem mooi en handig gemaakte app! Zeer content mee :) | Still learning, but so far, I'm enjoying using this app. | Keeps my wife and I connected to our precious kids as they have fun in Europe. we live vicariously through them in NZ | Been using this for my RTW trip and it's great, a little travel diary, and also so close friends and family can see how the trip is going. | Made keeping track of our trip really easy | Used Polar steps on a previous vacation to Thailand and Vietnam it is an amazing app to chronicle all your travels and offer a book to commemorate all of your adventures in. Love this app | Love seeing the adventures of friends and family so quickly, easily and geographically | Great app to store photos show family where you've been and to track your travels, excellent | Love watching family and friends travel. | So easy and fun to track your travels and keep family in the loop | Amazing.. wish I had discovered it ages ago | Watching my sisters trip in easy and fun way. Would be better if the comments could be on specific pic and not the whole batch of pics. | Super handy app. You can even make photo books from all your travels afterwards. | Ottimo | Perfect fect for logging your route with pics. Would be Great if it was accessible for people to access it with social media that didn't have the app. But quite brilliant all the same... | We've been using it for 6 years. Reliable and easy way to track travel, add photos, and produce good quality photobooks, full of great memories. I particularly like the added automatically generated details, like the map of all travel during the trip at the start of a book and the temperature and location details for each step. Plus, it is easy to share with family while travelling so they can privately keep up to date on each trip. We've never looked back. | Just Excellent | really good to let your folks follow a trip | Having used the Polarsteps app previously, I knew I just had to record my current trip to the Australian high country and the Man from Snowy River Festival. When I received my Travel Book of the trip in my motorhome from Coffs Harbour NSW to Perth WA I was astounded at the quality of my book and how it captured the trip so beautifully üòç. My travelling companions also thought the book was fabulous. App is easy to use, and I love it üòÄ | Great | Great app! Fantastic way to track our trip x | Best app üíØüíØüíØ | Fabulous way to follow the travels of my daughter every day. I look forward to her posts and photos and feel like I'm travelling with her. It's wonderful!üòä | A really good app for recording your journeys and holidays. Really simple and user friendly. | Great app for tracking! | Great way to track my travel. | Incredible app for tracking multi stop holidays / travels. Very simple to upload and crop photos and videos too. | While travelling it's a really great app to keep your friends and family updated where you are and what you're experiencing. I was able to send a link to those who I want to be able to read the blog. Polarstep is really easy to use and I really like it. | A fabulous tool to document your travel experiences! | Great app for sharing travel experiences with friends and family. Easy enough to use and edit, map showing places visited is very nice touch. Slight improvement could be to make uploading photos easier. | Great to follow loved ones | By limiting our posts to followers only, this app is a secure way to share travels with family members in real time. | Truly my favourite travel app. Spend some time on updating this as you travel and you will have the most amazing travel journal that you can print in hardback. cannot recommend this app enough! | When you have a traveller in the family, it's a great way to follow their experiences. | Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è | It's a good app, I used it all along my travels and loved it. U can make little notes and pics alongside to keep a trace of what and where you've been. The only thing I'd like to notice is the impossibility to duplicate a trip you've done. It's not possible then to keep an original copy of your notes. | Great app as I'm not a FB person.. | Love using this app to track my journey and follow other friends A very useful app to create memories of places that you can share with your friends | Perfect | Great, easy way to record our travels and share with family and friends | Polarsteps, my travel companion! What an amazing app!! In the future you could add features to the travel stats like number of unesco world heritage sites visited and more. There's a lot of potential in this app. Please bring back the old flags design, those new flags in circle look strange in my opinion. | Brilliant app for keeping in touch with lived ones while travelling, for daily diary and for photo catalogue of trips. Excellent | I'm new to this app but it was recommended by friends and I'm loving it. | Great for recording and sharing trip details. | Really helps me capture the details of my holiday. By posting once a day I can keep on top of things and capture all the good stuff. Love the simple, well thought out interface. | Very useful and relatively easy to report on each step. It would help if it didn't jump back to the bottom after making an edit to the text. | Great app. Have used it for many years & really love it | Absolutely tedious. Someone recommended an app called Been but it got awful reviews on Android so I checked this one out instead. They're not really at all similar. This app is so tedious to input your locations of travel. It insists on you compiling your entire trio and adds in travel lines from point to point. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to just have one map up that shows all the places you've traveled, but instead you have to open each trip. The app lacks intuitiveness. | Great ap!! | Nice app to log your travels and make visible to your relatives | Can see exactly where my son was when travelling abroad. Very reassuring | Fantastic! | Great app to give family and friends a better idea as to where u are. Able to add pictures and also extra steps along the way. Quite happy user, although the down side is that i cannot reply to individual comments, only a general reply. Also I wanted to add that it would be great to be able to choose the mode of transport in between 2 distant points as it automatically defaults to plane even if it actually is a train travel. | Staat of valt met de inhoud natuurlijk. Maar een verademing in vergelijking met andere sociale media. | Love this app. I've been using it for years. Would be helpful if you could see a bigger photo when creating the book on a pc. The tiny picture isn't helpful! Even more helpful would be that you could edit the photo withing the website/app! | Excellent app for keeping our family updated on our travels. | Great app with good user experience to share my trip to my family and friends üëå | A great app to see the travel blog and photos of family travelling in Asia. You can really zoom in to the exact location they are staying (I guess they have to be in an area with internet) | Polarsteps is a great way to record your travels, include photos and videos of what you have seen. A great way to share with your friends and relatives as they can track you on a map of the country you are travelling in. It would be great to be able to choose a mode of transport and also have a leaving time, not just arrival time. | Brilliant app and can't believe it is free. I have been using polar steps for about 3 years and it is a great app that does exactly what it is supposed to. I don't know how they can keep it free but if it wasn't I would pay for it. Our family follow our adventures every year and we love looking back on our travels to remind ourselves of what we have been up to. I highly recommend it. | My favourite travel tracker. Very easy to use. | Great app | Great for tracking your journey. | -Wonderful way of sharing the journey. | Interesting visualization of following somebody's journey. The UX however can and needs to be improved for editors. Multiple times I've lost some carefully drafted texts and had to start over again. Also numbering the Pictures and being able to include a short description would help the viewer to follow the journey. | Love the satellite tracking and travel stats. Very useful travel diary.

It serves my purpose well. I appreciate having everything in one convenient location. I can easily mark places I want to visit and view them on a map. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly. This application is an excellent tool for planning vacations. I have used it for my second vacation and will undoubtedly continue to use it in the future. | Would recommend! Very smart and convenient for planning the trip ahead | This app was great, allowed me to have all my travel plans in one place, very easy to use! | I love this app! Stay organized in one place! I used to use MS Word for all of the details but I love how Wanderlog automatically provides links and other info about all the places I have on my itinerary. I also like that I can make my own categories for other information. I'm using this app for four trips I'm in the process of planning and it's great. It's helpful for small trips of a couple days and two week long trips. | great tool for planning. organize evrerything in one place. Very flexible. easy to plan a road trip with many different stops. amazing amount of resources. | Well organized, easy to send info from my email confirmations, also updated expenses if included from reservations. Some interesting recommendations, easy to add places of interest to itinerary. Could be better in providing directions with options. | absolutely indispensable for trip planning! | Meh... Useless app with prev pay | Very useful to manage trips activities | Very convinient for planning a trip. It's quite laggy sometimes. Hope it will get better in the future. | easily captured all my trip details in one place! I could even refer back to the content that I forwarded if I had any doubts. | One the greatest tools ever for planning a trip. Ive used it on my 26 days trip to Japan and no other tool has been so usefull for planning and keep diary of all places we visit and wanted to visit! Its also incredibly easy to add things to your own planner from other peoples planners to easily build up your own Wanderlog üòâ | The perfect app for planning and organizing trips. | This app seems really cool but upon initial download, the amount of pop ups that show and redirects that the app does are incredibly distracting. I'll update the review as I use the app more however. | The idea is cool but the execution is poor. The loading time is long even though I have a pro account and offline access. In a good app this should mean loading and updating in background, but here is have to sit through seconds of loading on a high speed connection. Can't add regular transportation modes such as ferries to the planner. The auto-importer misses a lot and if you turn on Gmail auto-search it duplicates a lot. There are better products out there. | Great way to collect all your ideas for your trip then arrange them day by day. I really enjoy the map function to easily see where all your chosen attractions are located. | Useful app but lags a lot (I haven't seen this much lag in any other app) | A really useful app with a lot of options. Sadly it is pretty laggy on mobile and small things like swapping items on the itinerary from one day to another are error prone. The view on mobile can also get too cluttered, especially if you plan long trips with multiple stops. Also, it's sad that you can only purchase a yearly subscription to get premium features. Monthly subscriptions make way more sense for this type of app | great resource for planning | very helpful in planning a trip to a new place. It helps map your itinerary and shows many little things that help you complete your trip without thinking you missed something special. | I searched for a free app. This is not free. | I just found THE app for travelling! Amazing one-stop platform to put everything together, from flight details to lodging to places of interest... BONUS stuff: able to create notes, share with co-creaters, best routes, recommended places to go for dine and play... Thank you Wanderlog team for creating this awesome app! üòÅ | The premise of the app is great and it has a lot of great features, but lately it has been extremely glitchy, for example the ""add"" button for new places to visit doesn't work for some sites no matter how much I press it, also the loading time is really frustrating. Today I made a new travel plan and painstakingly added more than 30 places to visit, only to find a few minutes later that the trip was nowhere to be found on my account :(( | I started planning a two week international trip with this app, so easy and intuitive. I love it and have recommended to friends who travel | awesome | This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used. it's just so well thought out. I am putting this at the top of the list of my favourite app. The web app is even better! | Really helpful to have all your travel information in one place! The explore page is great for inspiration and ideas. The interface can look a bit cluttered but once you familiarise yourself with it, it's really simple to use | I really love how this app organizes all your details. Especially love the feature where you email your reservations, and it plugs it into your iteniary! I attached screenshot of park passes, entered addresses, and it offers up other places to go and see. With a family of 7, I have to stay on top of every detail and reservation: Wanderlog makes that so easy! | I love this app! It's so easy to use, all your trip details in one place, easy to edit & manage agendas. It also opens the door to experiences you may have missed or overlooked by showing other points of interest, restaurants & experiences. I think they have covered everything you want to keep track of, all in one place! | excellent travel planner app | I stumbled on wanderlog a while ago and saw an amazing opportunity to use it for my trip to Korea. It was really easy to use, the interface was good. For me the best feature is the ability to have a map that shows the distance from one place to another. All in all I will definitely use this app again. So amazingly easy to plan for a trip. | Good idea and app but you will get tons of ""ads"" for hotel etc. But the Pro price is exactly what's wrong with todays subscription model. It's a travel app and the only option is to pay for a whole year, and it cost almost ‚Ç¨60 (!). I also get a more expensive price in the app when i'm logged in than what their website say (‚Ç¨50). ‚Ç¨60/year for Pro that most people will use for offline mode and attachments is crazy. Better to pay for e-sim. | La mejor aplicaci√≥n para planificar viajes nacionales e internacionales. | I used the free version to plan my upcoming 1 month solo trip for Europe. Is a very good app which help me plan my itinerary easily and handy!! I even introduce my sister to use this app and she love it. | This app is not free, it is $50 per year after they collect data. I don't mind paying for an app, but don't lie. | awesome app! just what I was looking to plan our trips. full feature and very easy to use. | I have been the designated trip planner for our friend group for almost 10 years now. I have used apps like Tripit, Google Travel, splitwise, Citymapper, you name it! Once I found Wanderlog, I deleted all other apps. Wanderlog is all these apps combined into one!! And it's virtually glitch free. We recently took a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. Planning and executing has been a breeze. The developers have thought about every possible scenario. Budget summary could use some fine tuning. | Amazing app with all the features I need for planning trips. I shared with my family, friends, and today with coworkers. Looking forward to improvements as this app progresses. | absolutely love this app, I use it to keep track of places and things I want to see and also use it to log my trip as a trav journal! | Nica app. But it has many functionalities missing from the free version . | Fabulous app that has been so valuable in coordinating our trip. Everything you need is right here! AAA+ | Great tool to help plan and navigate our trips | Good functionality but I find the constant 'helpful' popup tips very grating. I think they are a good idea but the fact that it forcibly changes what's displayed on the screen and drags you away from what you were trying to do is too intrusive and instead of reading then I've just been clicking them away - hopefully I'm almost through them all now. Also maybe a personal preference but I find the text and interface a bit too zoomed in/not dense enough, maybe there could be a setting for this? | Great app for travel planning. Has the ability to add places, notes, etc. A great all round travel app | LOVE being able to share the trip itinerary with others. LOVE being able to easily re-arrange the things I've selected to do. LOVE multiple sources to find best of the best w regard to dining, etc., Can't wait to try it LIVE!! | this is a great system and can even quickly start navigation in rental cars. | really like this app. helped with planning | Excellent app, has made it possible for me to plan complex trips overseas and keep organized | I organised my Kyoto trip with the help of Wanderlog. I had an amazing good time. Now I am planning my next trip in July. Thank u Wanderlog. | I moved to Wanderlog from TripIt because of the clean, modern interface of the application and the website. I also like the map feature where it plotted on the map all you lodgings. Customer service was responsive and fast. Overall this great apps helped me on my 5 weeks trip to South America with many flights, hotels, car rentals and activities.AI integration looks promising as well. | Really good app very helpful to be notified when places will be closed | I love this app! It made trip planning so much easier to have everything in one spot, and so intuitively. Very user friendly and helped by allowing me to research options and have them pulled up in advance | Great Planning Tool | User unfriendly. Can't search within trip. Useless. If I could give less stars, I would. | this app has been amazing for planning my trips. absolute life saver so easy to use | Just used Wanderlog to plan my vacation and it was fantastic! Highly recommend giving it a try. | Amazing tool to plan and organize your trip. Saves a ton of time. There's a lot of room for improvement, but what they've got is worth 5 stars for how useful it's been. | Very good for travel planning. Easy to use. | I love the ability to organize to the level available even in the free version. Looking forward to what features and functionality are available in the paid version. | Powerful organizer for travel plans. | After much researching, I decided to give Wanderlog a go and it was pretty neat. A lot of things can be synced by forwarding hotel and flight emails, adding the cost of individual places / activities / food, adding links etc. The itinerary makes the trip easy to navigate, way better than Spreadsheet ü§≠ So, thanks Peter Xu! For creating this wonderful app. I've started using for my next trip with my girlfriends :) | Very good apps for travel. My whole trips is plan well because got the Wonderlog, very helpful. | Great travel planning app with new features added regularly. | brilliant, everything is in one place, I love it | I have used Wonderlog for many of my trips. | The app keeps crashing on some places of the map view. I thought it was depending on the number of places I had added but then I realized this was not the cause. I also found quite annoying to add notes in the Itinerary view. Considering this is a touristic app, you should add other payment ways to buy the subscription as I tried to do it from the Google Play Store and because their country limitations I wasn't able to do it. | Too many pop ups, even after disabling tips. Would be nice to have a calendar view of itinerary as well as a download to excel or pdf function. | so far, to help on planning it has been helpful. it aggregates the info from my mails | a great app to consolidate travel details into a single itinerary. It's especially handy when you use multiple platforms to book flights, accommodation, tours and train/car travel as it's easy to check that booking dates are correct. | Not for me too nosy and seems to want to take over I installed Thanks | good and nice | I've only used it for a few days, but so far everything works great! It's great to be able to gather all the details of a trip in one place instead of searching email and texts and saved documents. | Great features | I love this app! I'm that person who is the planner of the group and always has a Google Sheet. I LOVE the organization/the mapping functionality of this app & the ability to have different ""layers"" of the map so I can see locations for different days or purposes (a map showing me everything I want to do! or a map showing me all the restaurants I'm considering! So helpful). Also love emailing the app to auto populate hotel reservations and train/flight reservations onto the itinerary!! | While not perfect, this is the best travel app I've tried so far. Great way to organize my itinerary, get directions, see suggested stops, and more. I'll keep using it! | Best travel planning app ever. | Very good App. Useful when you want for city break's with many things to, like Paris | love this app, planning a trip to Hawaii, this was a great help to keep track of everyone's tickets and itinerary. Bravo! | Extremely helpful. It's now one of my favorite apps. We just got back from a four day weekend, and it was fantastic to have all the information in one place. No more searching through email and texts to find information about your next stop. Directions are ready with just one click. We are planning a longer vacation in August. As I make reservations or book flights, I just forward the email to the app. The info will be right there when I need it. Great for detailed planners and for casual trips. | Would've been a great travel planning app, but I had lists just disappear without any explanation and have to remake them again. Will reach out if it happens again. | UPDATE: Plus one star for responding and at least attempting to fix the issue. Pro version still very expensive and a poor value, especially when their system burps at inconvenient times. Garbage app. Made the mistake of purchasing Pro. It won't automatically add vrbo's or other similar bookings and won't let you forward emails or enter bookings manually either. TripIt here I come. | wonderful tool, forever evolving, like travel itself, to make it easier, more intuitive and indespensible. | UNINSTALLING - Was given the impression that this app was free compared to competitor apps that are ""overpriced annual subscriptions"". This also has an annual subscription price, which is required in order to do anything in the app beyond the 7 day trial. $70 for an app to plan a budget friendly road trip... talk about ironic. | AI is fairly accurate and the recommendations are legit. I hope to see more exclusive deals to justify the subscription. | Best App for Traveling | organizing my trip in a couple of weeks and I'm already in love. THIS is exactly what I needed to sort out distance, opening hours and other things that would stress me out if I didn't have the details all laid out in a concise, neat way. | Offline access behind a paywall? LOL. Thats a new one. That means there's no acceptable free version as many trips you can end up with poor or no connectivity. | Really difficult to separate free from paid pro app. There is no activities/tour tab in this app, which makes it useless for me. The graphics are beautiful. I like the way it pulls in suggested activities and shows the map but without an activities... | This is a great app for travel planning. I found several spots I would have missed and I loved being able to plan out our days with travel time estimates to avoid packing to much in to a single day. | incredible product. what would take me several sites to research and plan can now be done on one site lots of features and simple to use | Excellent! It's the most complete and intuitive app available. 100x better than spreadsheets, helps you to keep track of expenses, and also suggests attractions you should go to during your trip. I love it! | Stuff of nightmare. Pop ups everywhere. So many screens, sections, buttons, navigation, suggestions, recommendations, automation. OMG cannot understand a bit. Started with paid version. Then immediately uninstalled, phew. What a relief. | have added 21 stops and it works great, love it so far. | easy for group travel collaboration. Great tool! | This is a great way to plan my trip! | Travel planning for a family of 4 is tough but Wanderlog made it feel intuitive. We were able to plan for multiple cities with multiple hotels like a breeze. It uses other popular productivity tools to superpower the mapping and itinerary information as well. I'm thinking about going pro because of the quality. | so easy to navigate | I'm not much of a trip planner, but I recently took a trip to South Korea, and this app was a life saver. It was really easy to use, and I loved how flexible it was. You can plan an itinerary and upload travel documents to it. It gives you recommendations of where to go/see and includes a map with the route you planned on your itinerary. It is a stress free app with so many cool and helpful features that I will for sure use this app again for my next big trip! | Amazing app and I haven't even tried to paid version yet. I'm usually an extensive Google doc planner but this app makes it so much easier! The organization is so helpful and visually pleasing. It makes it so much easier to see the full picture without having to scroll scroll scroll | the best so far for travel plan. Prefer if it's not too cluttered. Some locations can't be added into the itinerary, don't know why | awesome for managing your holiday especially when you're doing multiple cities or countries | The app has many really great features, but unfortunately I sometimes find myself still going to email app or Google Maps, because of performance. It takes about 8 seconds on my phone between tapping the app in the launcher and (no interaction) seeing my itinerary' today view. | service is great, but the app freezes/stalls pretty regularly. Could use some UX improvements for the rearranging process on mobile too | I mostly used the app to save destinations that I wanted to visit. It was good to just come back to the app when I was in Boston to look at my points of interest to visit on the fly. | I travel a lot and this particular app is great as it pulls all of my information in and if it is unable to, it allows me to add it to my itinerary. It sorts all of my travel, lodging, tours, etc. I can add attachments, map locations, Transit cards, | I used Wanderlog to plan a 10-day trip to Italy, covering Venice Florence and Rome. The app is a great way to organize the trip plan in one place, and while on the trip, to navigate from place to place through links to Google maps. Fantastic tool if you like to be organized and plan out daily itineraries. | Great app for uploading itinerary. The dates and activities could be better formatted. I love the uploading confirmation emails to the app for it to automatically update the page. Also, love the trip recommendations. So useful. | amazing | WOW! This is a fun, very easy and useful app to use. I'm still testing and am planning our itinerary for an upcoming vacation. Wish list: 1. Add a search function so that I can find things in my overview, itinerary and notes. 2. Add export function to Google Calendar. 3. The expense sharing function does not handle changes in currency. | Excellent tool, even though the importing part can be improved...it helps a lot to organize and visualize your trip | just try whoa its blow my mind its a great app | cool planner | Awesome application easy to use and very informative üëç | really helped plan our trip to Japan with 4 other people. made it super easy to see people's suggestions and then make an itinerary with it | Installing app for the first time. Also I am not able to skip the subscription page. I don't need the features which come with the subscription. I just want to use the free version. Even if I click the X on the top-right, I return back to the previous screen. I simply don't want to leave my credit card info. | so far so good. | Good apps! | I'm so glad this app exist | The app has a nice user experience and you can insert everything you need in one place. I don't know if it's my phone but sometimes it gets slow to use and i have to wait for the command that I get. | LOVE THIS APP! Organize places by type and see places or itinerary on the MAP! So helpful in planning, and sharable itinerary ‚ù§Ô∏è I will be using Wanderlog for all of my trips moving forward!! | This is my 3rd time using this app for my trips. Easy to use. Recommended. | The functionality is good but the app feels slow and clunky when you move things around. Itinerary view is not easy to scroll and you can't just move from places to visit to the itinerary section. | Love this app! Makes trip planning so much easier! The only thing I'd ask for is if they could add Naver Maps for Korea, because it's almost impossible with Google Maps, some of the restaurants or cafes you want to go to don't exist. But apart from that, it's a great app! üëç | Overall a great app to really help plan and group things. However the app is quite clunky at times, especially when wanting to ""rearrange"" places or notes around. It scrolls back up to the top and sometimes holding and dragging the item gets laggy and becomes annoying. I would use it again but these small things could do with some improvement! | Excellent app! This app was a huge help when planning my big trip to California with my friends. This app made it so easy to plan all the travel destinations we were planning on going. This app has so many good features like offline maps and adding hotel and flight reservations. I love all the features it has and I highly recommend this app! | Very easy to add places and rearrange. I would have enjoyed a longer description of the landmark was attached to each site. Each day was color coded which was very helpful. | helped to group activities together | First time using app. Will never travel without it again. Fun, interactive way to trip plan. Instant win. | absolutely fantastic app. I use it for all my trips | Very good app with a lot of great features to help plan your itinerary | Helpful to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip from flight, rental car, places staying, coordinating activities and restaurants. This was especially helpful for preplanning with a traveller with Celiac disease. | Very easy to use, and incredibly convenient. | very comfortable and helpful! | Nice and easy to use. | awesome | love the app. been using it for the last 4 months to prepare/plan for our family trip in June. it's cool you can budget everything out, add hotel reservations, attach event tickets, and split the budget up if needed. searching the map feature for things to add to your itinerary is so much fun! | Very nice and easy travel planner üëå | It can't find any cities to Start | This is a wonderful, full featured travel planning app. It is making an extended trip so much easier for my whole family to keep track of. Thank you so much for creating this indispensable tool! I didn't need to pay for the subscription to make great use of this app, but I did (after finding the app so helpful while planning) for my own benefit, yes, but also in thanks to support the developers. I highly recommend this app. | Always a Pop-up window open, can't use it | I'm so glad this app exists. It's better than just writing down a list of places you want to go. However, sometimes when you type stuff in, the screen lags for a second. It's not terrible, but it's still pretty annoying | it was good for planning my trip and make a lists of places | Great concept and tells the user how long it takes to get to their next destination, but the app keeps crashing. I've lost a couple of places I've saved too. Good to start with but best to keep a personal copy with an excel sheet or something | it's very neat! perfect for planning any range of trips | this app is so helpful! everything is in one place. Flights, car rentals, hotels, and your itinerary! | Good concept and has some nice features. However, the UI is SO overcrowded with elements and information I actually got stressed at some point. Maybe squash the bottom side buttons into an expandable/collapsible menu? Hide the summary description for places to visit unless expanded? Shrink the date under the itinerary tab, why must it take 20% of an almost 7"" screen?? Overall nice app, but the UX does need some work to make it a bit more simplified. Too much information in too little space. | My initial review was regarding the frequent pop ups, however a member of the team has reached out and reassured me that things are still a work in progress. I really enjoy using the app, and it has saved me a lot of time compared to planning simply on Google maps. I can confidently say that I'll be replacing Google maps for Wanderlog as my trip planning app. | Not working, can't even specifically any country literally taking a lifetime to load. | ok this app is the best. I can travel smarter, cheaper, and have a better time. this is genius how designed and presented!! | *** I remember why I cancelled and deleted this app. Your FREE trial cost $60.00. In my book that ain't free. I realize that you need to get paid for your hard work, but FREE should be FREE! After the trial period, YOU could disable the account if I don't send you the $60.*** UPDATE- After figuring out I had a bad case intercranial rectumitis (I had my head up my a$$), Wanderlog probably is a very good app, it just wasn't what I need. And their customer service is really top-notch. Thanks | Such an amazing app. I'm usually the trip planner and it is so nice not to have it all in my head, email, written down and then I have to verbally tell others. It's so easy because it is all in 1 place and people can easily be on trips and see info. Like seeing flight info of other travelers is so helpful. It imports it all for everyone to see and you can easily plan out your entire days. The map feature is so nice too. I really can't compliment this app enough. | Little harder to use than the browser. GREAT trip planning app. Already got coworkers hooked on it! | This is a great app for organizing and planning a trip. | This is a really useful and well-done app. But the constant forced tutorials get really overbearing. You can't dismiss them or opt out, and even after using the app for a week I'm still getting them. I really like the app, but this is way too much. | Love the app! | Good but overpriced. I've planned several trips with it an even had a subscription. It's a really good tool, though at times laggy, but the price is just way too high for what you get out of it. | This app was a god send ... It's super easy to use. Planning an upcoming trip and this have mde organizing easy day a breeze and the ability to let others edit the agenda is great as well... The only downside is the Pro upgrade... I would love to access features in the Pro level but currently it's only an annual plan ... I don't need it for a year but would definitely get it for a month or 2. | Great app! | Nice app helps me see my vision in place | The tips are really effing annoying. Allow us to turn them off. | The app is great however, need a monthly subscription choice. I would happily pay for the couple if months I need it for, but not billed annually | well designed comparison of multiple review sites | super easy to navigate | The app worked fine till I signed up for the PRO and now everything is in French although it says English on the sign in. | I have just downloaded this app and so far it has been amazing. I love planning holidays and this just makes it so easy, when I see something online, a place or recommendation I just quickly add it to the app and it's there. I get directions, I get picture and what else is near. I can't give a review of how it works when I'm actually in Italy, but for now I'm finding it really really helpful to sort out where I'm going and the direction that my holiday is going to take. so far it's exciting | Is not actually free | used it for 5 vacations so far over the last 3 years. Love the money splitting capability and distance calculations. I forward all my booking emails and the app does the rest. Best way to collaborate with travel mates on vacation planning. | I used this app for a family trip with two teenagers. We were trying to get our teenagers to engage and help us plan some things to do on our vacation. It worked great! Love the shared functionality, the explore features, the map view, and the ease of adding links from Google. | I really enjoyed planning my trip to Lisbon. I found other tips from other travellers. It was easy to plan, I liked the fact I could see which sightseeing I should do in what order. I wish I could have the option to add t staurants as a separate tab. This might be added as plus option. Otherwise I look forward to planning my next trip | App is good with lots of organizational features, but is incredibly laggy and slow even with good internet connection. | The app is convenient & it includes many functions that are really helpful. Recommend to add in a function that helps us to record the travel fare (like by Grab/Taxi or Public Transport). | very helpful in planning stops and good suggestions | No access to app without paying first. | Good app but cost doesn't seem feasible. I only travel once a year -- two at most. There should be an option to choose payment per trip or per month. | amazing trip planner, we travel alot with family and I don't know what I would do without this app! | love it! makes it so easy to see my plans on the go and make changes to my itinerary as new things pop up | great wee app | Still takes lot of time to load the trip details even in the offline mode (with Pro subscription) Auto-fill day is a good feature but it should take the flight arrival and hotel check-in time into consideration while giving suggestions. There should be an option to choose the start and end time for siteseeing and auto-fill should suggest places based on the available time Budget tracking should have an option to add tripmates locally and not by email. Giving 3 stars as this has huge potential | Great info and options. | Super, super helpful app!! I have been googling sites & using separate apps looking for hotels to plan my family's multiday sight-seeing road trip. But nothing I found prior to Wanderlog had a map that helped track my noted locations, along with daily itenerary categories, places for my notations, and lits more. All of which really helps to organize & simplify the planning of our trip to/in each state & our traveling direction each day. Planning out an itinerary is SO much easier with Wanderlog | This app provides a convenient way to plan the itinerary. It provides a good overview of all the places of interest. | Claims to be a free app, but then insists on a credit card which will be charged after a 1 week trial. If it was worth the $70, I would pay it, but I'm not setting up an automatic charge before trying it. | I've used this app in the past and had nothing but a great experience. Definitely something I would recommend. If you're not the brightest crayon in the box, you might leave a negative review ü´°üòâ | Wanderlog allows a comprehensive scheduling experience. I'm able to add places to multiple lists then add each item to different days in the itinerary. I can invite my friends to the plan- & choose who can make changes. Also, when I add a place I can add the cost in any currency I desire, split that payment between whoever I need to, & the total is tallied in my native currency. I also like the ""explore"" option to get ideas for more activities in the area I'm visiting. | This app is great for travel and sharing your trip with those who are traveling with you. I love that the app links to youtube and tiktok, so I can watch videos of the place I am going to visit! | We started using Wanderlog this year, using the free version to plan a trip. We like having multiple users and the map option, which allows us to see how close all destinations are to each other. Today, I accidentally deleted our trip plan. I went to the help section and found that I could email support and they might be able to restore it. As it is Sunday, I didn't expect to hear from anyone, but got an email within hours from one of the app creators, and my trip was back! A++ service and app! | Terrible app. Tried to login on both web browser and mobile app and both FAILED. Website gave me an 503 error while loading the login screen, application doesnt even login. Ditch this app and choose another planner instead. | Just downloaded app to start planning after good reviews. Has uploaded hotel details from email forwarded but doesn't take flight details from same email. Won't let me tap on an airline or flight code when I try to input manually. Frustrated already! | This app makes it easier to plan and share live itinerary with family and friends. I use it to plan nearby activities which showed the distance which help to also plan our transport. And it syncs to Google Map so it is helpful to make last min changes and yet travel safely. Highly recommended travel planning app! | the best planner | great app for planning trips. I will use it for a long time. | This is a great travel planner app! Can't recommend it enough. | The versality of the app was fairly easy to maneuver. Activity suggestions were very helpful in planning the day events. | I'm enjoying all the tips on what to expect and where to visit. this app makes it easier to plan and you can get directions to each place within the app. very convenient . thank you! | I just got this app and I'm already frustrated. I can't add transport between places (like Uber from airport to hotel) I can't add an activity without adding a place but when you add a place it shows all sorts of other information I don't want to see. I don't want recommendations. I don't want pictures. I don't need the web description showing. When I'm done adding places to the itinerary, I want the ""add a place"" field to go away. It could be great but UI is not efficient or customizable | Can't even try without card first no thanks | I found this to be a very useful app for itinerary planning. One feature I would tweak is to have the ability to numerically place a new item into the itinerary rather than having it added to the end and then have to reorder it. Other than that minor issue, it is a great app! | I was able to plan and map out my entire trip. It was a great resource to have! | I am a frequent traveler and travel with big groups 2-3 times a year. This app is EVERYTHING! Makes planning so easy with other people as well.

How it works
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 30,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we‚Äôre able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don‚Äôt have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.

One of my favorites on my phone! | Good app but I'm not willing to pay to get tracking. I would be willing to pay a 1 time cost rather than a subscription. | Love this app. I fly standby and need this when I travel. It does have a free service to use Plus no nasty pop up ads. I like the 3D viewing But it's limited on that function. You can opt to pay a very little monthly fee.

Update: problem resolved with the latest release | Need a dark mode for arrival and departure list the white screen is too bright working 3rd shift on the ramp | Nice app | Nice application for first class man | Brilliant so far | Best app for planespottersüòÅüòÅ very happy with this app | new | I really liked this app. It's so useful. | it's üëå | It is an amazing app to use if you either want to just have a look at planes or even have a look at any incoming flights live for your family | This is so beautiful love from flight radar love from Bangladesh üáßüá©üáßüá©üáßüá©‡•§ | Best game ever planes airports every thing | Could not be happier. It's a great tool to find truth in the news we hear. Keep up the good work. | Good app to monitor the flights, and it's usually quite accurate. | Great tracking app for aviation. | Love to watch who's flying by. | It's good especially since I work at an airport as a ramp agent | Really good outstanding | Very Helpful | Great app, but a small feature of estimating from which runway the plane takes off from would be great | Keep eyes open | NYC app | do u respond | My experience is pretty good tho plus I found 7 Boeing 747 and 3 Airbus A380 and I was shocked to see it | Excellent while out and about | Nice | Maps is not updating time to time so please improve map updating process, it is very good app I use this app for 5-6 years ago I like it but please Update the satellite map by which , can see the original airport structure on satellite map | Bery happy with the details available. | Used to be a great app for occasional checking of what's flying overhead, but ads are now so intrusive and loud that it's not worth opening anymore. | Easy to use and gives a lot of individual plane details use free version. | Good | Location issue | Very accurate and easy to use. I get updated information on take off delays from Flightradar before the airline tells me. Seems to run about 15 seconds behind real-time. | Great app makes picking up travelers being able to track the flights is easy instead of waiting in the cell phone lot forever when delayed or canceled | Very useful application | Nice Service | Great üòä | Great app - absolutely Love it !! | Very accurate | Good app | Good | Not fare in fees subscribe at all... I mean if you want to update to Gold 129.99SR. But we can see in Turkey state only 30SR. For same Gold upgrade Why?????? | Afk | Good app | Best app ever | I used to love this app & would have happily given it 5* previously - but the adverts have become so overbearing it is almost unusable at times. I would have also happily upgraded - & was on the verge of doing so - until the ads became so forceful that it felt like I was being forced to subscribe. Instead, I will be deleting the app & installing an alternative one. Shame that you ruined it to line your pockets... | Wonderful application for spotting aircraft | Absolutely love this app | A very good apk, but, too much expensive. Yes, I know that. However it's too much expensive ... | nice app | Useful,graet!All the best! | Love this app and spend a lot of time on it as a result. Incredible to watch the surveillance operations of Ukrain over the Black Sea | Was a lovely and extremely useful app. Regrettably, I've been forced to stop using it: recently, obnoxious and un-stoppable video ads interrupt the experience so frequently that Icannot use the app. | Easy and infomatic | Accurat and easy to use | The app has been very flaky lately. Shows planes going in one direction and then going the opposite direction right away randomly. Also showing incorrect information (EL AL planes at BEY, planes from Dubai to TLV in BEY etc ..) Not sure what can be trusted anymore. | Exceptional, track track flights for friends. Live on flight path, fabulous info. | I just love knowing what is flying above my head...for some reason. Satisfying app. | I see airplane in sky I look at app find plane and go that's neet | Enjoyed the app until today when I had difficulty returning to the app from an ad...had to go through ""x-ing"" the ad a bunch of times before being allowed back into the app. I don't mind the ads normally, but this is ridiculous and aggravating. | Very informative.....keep it up | Great üëç | I don't know if this is something you can fix or not, but there is a hellicopter that flies around ohio and sometimes the michigan area. It is just labeled as ( A109). It's actually Mercy Health Life Flight, and its registration is (N95RZ). If there is a way to actually make say the right info, that would be great. | Great app, works very good . | Very good and technical | excellent app fun to use and track aircraft | Now i cwn look some planes | I work at the airport on the B757 and A300. This is app is 100% accurate and updated in real time with arrivals and departures. You can follow the aircraft to their country and/or city of arrival. | One of my favorite go-to apps everyday. | Best app | It's a very nice app for plane spotters and (research for me) | Good one that App my me so useful | Awesome & Helpful info! | Always providing accurate and timely information in an easy to read format. | Great app for an aviation enthusiast. The AR feature is great to simply point your phone at a plane and see its information. | Great for backyard plane identification.

My experience has been incredible, the moments they weren't I looked for help and had a fast response and support from the WP experience team!! I believe the increase in packers using the app has decreased the fast response, acceptance and care with communication from the hosts (I noticed personally and empirically from others packers). My only tip: give courses/certificates to hosts too. THANK YOU!üíô | a bit too expensive | Quick and easy to use | Fake app. Scam. Don't use it. A woman lied to me and did not show to pick me up. Nobody at the place new her. Her name is Ruby from La Belle Eco France. I hope she goes to hell. | Thanks you | Great app to travel around the world | Awesome | Perfect way to travel on a budget and meet awesome people along the way! | I bought a full year subscription. I stayed with one host approved by Worldpackers. The listing said I would have a private room, but when I got there he was expecting me to stay in the same room he was sleeping in (I was 19 at the time, and I am a girl). He also had a dog (not mentioned) who chewed up my boot. I contacted Worldpackers for a refund as I no longer trusted how they evaluate hosts and they refused to to give one. I would he very wary of signing up for this, especially for a year. | Hasta ahora un √©xito, | Excellent! | I recommend World Packers , it is my first experience with them , so far so good. They are really serious , there are training, advice, courses ..it is great | Super easy to use! | It's a great opportunitty to meet new people | Bit tricky to put all the information and for apply to volunteering.. I mean many questions to answer but in works really well! | Everything is so easy and convenient, straightforward app with an incredible purpose behind!! | Start | This is best for world tourüòçü§© | definitely better than the other worktrade websites. Highly recommend. Worth the money. | Good | Absolutely amazing for those who wants to exchange experiences in different places. Safe and trustworthy | Nice | Until now is pretty good. | Everything seems to be great! | Excellent options to share moments, travel and meet others cultures and countries | Best app for traveling | They help get a disturbed person tracked | I downloaded the app and tried many times to new account but it doesn't work? Because still now i didn't meet anyone through this app? Please let me how to full it? | Worldpackers is great. The information is clear. It's serious about the reviews and volunteers | Es de paga para poder participar. Obvio que no se paga por crear una cuenta üôÑ, pero eso de lo que hablas est√° escondido detr√°s del muro de pago, lo que no es nada barato, aparte que uno va a ir de ""voluntario"" as√≠ que desde un inicio la aplicaci√≥n gana y gana m√°s cuando ya la persona trabaja para esas empresas. Ustedes ganan un mont√≥n de plata a costa de voluntarios y cobrar toda esa cantidad es absurdo. | Love. It. One very small bug though- sometimes when asked if we're flexible with the dates, it takes 10-15 tries for it to accept my response. It just shuts down and doesnt let me reply, says, ""oops, something went wrong"" or ""couldn't complete your request"", which is very annoying because it causes delay in responding to offers and might end up in losing that opportunity. Do look into it. Otherwise, its a 10/10! | Absolutely fantastic app | It's very recommend for travelers around the world üåé in more 141 countries I love it | So far, so good (I only used it for 2 days) | Proposal is great, but 'choose a plan' when you click on anything | The idea is great, the app however...

You get to know people's culture from the inside. Its not expensive, you can practice another language, go to places which only locals know and enjoy yourself in another country. All in one!! I hardly recommend this app! | This app is so friendly and all that gives us is amazing | Great for international travelers! God bless you. | √â simples de usar. √â muito intuitivo. Eu poderia sugerir que houvesse uma esp√©cie de rede social dentro do app para que os volunt√°rios pudessem formar uma esp√©cie de rede dentro do app. | Awesome concept and can't wait to go on a trip! Unfortunately the app itself really needs work. Dates for example will show as available but only because a few days (or none) are unbooked out of an entire month. Mostly the search function/filters needs to be revamped. There's no option to search keywords based on region forcing you to scroll endlessly till you find what's right. It's just difficult in general to really narrow your search properly | Very great experience with world packers. I already found a place to stay!!!! The difference between the website and the app are that I couldn't find the inbox on the website(for some reason) but I could in the app. If you find some difficulties, I would try it in the app, then in the website, and if both don't work, then I would ask support for help. I hope that helps you! | Muito positivo | Very nice way to travel, volunteer, and meet people üòÄ highly recommended | Great | Great App!!! | Really nice app for volunteers | Very nice app and good platform, translation in app is needed | I don't know much about the app. I still just tried to volunteer one place. The app keeps insisting on me writing a review through... At the moment I like it, it helped me find a nice place to volunteer, and stay very cheap while I am traveling, while meeting locals. | Why we should pay you when we are providing free professional services and times . | El sistema de puntuaci√≥n y comentarios quiz√° sea de lo mejor en el mundo en cuanto a referencias de aquello que buscamos.

Going on my first world Packers experience in a few days, thank you for creating this. | It's a great app | I'm waiting to be a verified but this app is good I have my friend they are use this app to get a volunteers and to help our community. üòä | The search engine requires some love, the filters don't quite work. And I don't really feel a lot of support. | Ideia incr√≠vel, j√° vive experi√™ncia incr√≠veis atrav√©s do voluntariado. | Best | La aplicaci√≥n se ve bien, los filtros andan bien y las capacitaciones son muy lindas y productivas. Cuesta encontrar espacio para ejercer si sos nuevo, lo que recomiendo es que se enfoquen en mostrar mas seguido lugares nuevos para usuarios nuevos. Nosotros abonamos por la experiencia de la app y el voluntariado y esperamos obtener los mejores frutos de la misma. | Awesome | I think this is one of the best app ever created, you can travel the word for cheap, discover new cultures and people, I am really liking this app üëç | If you love to travel and also impact lives then worldpackers is for you. | Exploring the üåê! üóøü¶ãüíú | I have had a great time traveling the world with this site, I would highly recomend it. | This platform has been one of the best things I have used in my life, I recommend it 100% | User friendly. But looks like map is not accurate. | Amazing üòç | App is very intuitive and the platform looks interesting. However it's missing a filter for searching for animal welfare, animal shelters and hosts willing to collaborate with volunteers that travel with pets. At the moment the app just doesn't make it convenient for me to pinpoint the hosts matching my search criteria. Other than that great üëç | Some account are fake and I also not get proper response from any host And when I asked the team to refund my money back, they are saying that you are not fit for our refund policy.so don't pay any money | Can't sign up Captcha problem | Nice app | Well I'm not happy with fee structure, even paying in app there's some listing which asks for money than what's the point of volunteering | Hello Am from Tanzania I have met a traveler from Netherland volunteering some where. the one who instructed me to find this app as the best way to find any one to volunteer here to our working place. But I don't know what procedures to follow to get people to host them | Its a very good app if you want to travel the world and volunteer as well and have amazing experiences. The fee is a little bit high, however over all I am 100% happy! | Unable to use the app, no let me pass after put my birthday | Amazing | It has been working well for me. 3 confirmations in 1 week of searching | Good work ‚ù§Ô∏è | Melisimo | Embrace the worm & have an attitude of Gratitude and a lack of Expectation combined with a round trip ticket and your OFF to paradise found! | Worldpackers is an amazing app. They support you with the information needed and you feel safe to travel. | Awesome app, it works perfectly now. | It is been complicated to upload a profile picture, and without it the app is useless. But after some time and close communication it's been possible. Now it's time to go out there and be useful. Ciao | This is a great way to be able to volunteer in a new place. If you're interested in cultural exchange, this is the program for you. | ŸÜÿ≠ÿ™ÿßÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© | Constant interruptions! Why would I need 3 interruptions just this morning? No messages, just BS alerts from this app. I'm uninstalling. | Very nice app, for my trips! | The app doesn't let me put on a profile pic, even though i gave permission and i can upload my travell pictures and videos, for some reason the app acts as if i didn't allow it to enter my camera roll when i want to upload a profile pic, and if i don't a have a profile pic it's very unlikely to be accepted or trusted by a host. | The app does nothing but glitch. I can't look at any listings. | I just downloaded the app and everytime I try to select an opportunity to look at it... I can't. I select it and it loads for a second and immediately takes me back to the search page. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, along with restarting my phone to see if it would help... But it doesn't üòï if I could get it to actuall work I could give a fair review but it's not. I'm kinda disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è | This is good app | Easy to use, no problem at all of connection. | This app is wonderful I loved my experience, I'd definitely recommend it üòä | Very good interface. Quite addictive to scroll through the volunteering opportunities. | I COULDN'T FIND ANY SPACE YET ON EDINBURGH... BECAUSE I AM MALE THAT'S IT... MAYBE PEOPLE THINKING CHANGE ON FUTURE... | Had a seamless enough experience getting to know the app and make applications. I start my first experience this week. It was a little unclear how to confirm the trip through the app at first but this has been resolved. | Awesome app awesome assistance, good experience | Incredibile platform | Yup | It had nice experiences volunteering in eco villages and social projects. It is a great way to experience alternative ways of living. | My first experience with World Packers guaranteed I will do this again many times over. Lots of great hosts and new friends ‚úåÔ∏è I found the sharing and caring society many only dream ofüïäÔ∏è | Best experience ever with worldpackers! | Awesome opportunities on this website, love it | Excellent. | I'm going on my first trip, I'll update the review | I had two horrible experiences in this platform and, despite admitting that I was right on one and that the host was out of line in another, they cancelled my account when I asked one host to pay the money they owed me. I've been waiting for customer service's reply for over a month; all they do is ignore my emails. Try other legitimate, fair and FREE platforms like Workaway. P.S.: I'm not advertising Workaway, just pointing how awful this platform is. The worst mistake I've made in my life. | I haven't travelled yet, so I xan't speak on that, but I have been looking at postions and have confirmed a stay and I love the entire app. Everything works fantastic. | üëç | I love it | After the update is impossible to edit the album.

U doing ur job or not ? | When we buy ticket prices always they make more the date we choose I will use one more time I will not use again | Sistimnya payah, Transaksi kartu kredit dg metode cicilan tapi di tagih Full Payment jd Rugi biaya cicilan tau gitu bayar full payment aja | ufufu | Lately, this app has had so many errors... so stressful purchasing with traveloka... | Good | My hotel booking failed, and rebooking offers different options without breakfast, which is unfair as my initial price included it. Requesting a refund takes 3-5 days, which seems unjust. Traveloka's actions are causing inconvenience and financial loss to customers, impacting both time and money unfairly. Already contacted CS still no fair resolution. | Masa ganti hp krn rusak aja yg paylater gbsa di pake gmn ceritanya | Review jujur dari saya, dulu harga hotel di TRAVELOKA paling murah dibanding Agoda , Tiket com dan lain lain. Saya dulu pakai Agoda sampai pindah ke Traveloka, tapi sekarang harga hotelnya walau sudah pakai kode promo masih lebih murah harga hotel di Agoda, akhirnya saya balik lagi ke Agoda deh karena pesan kamar 1 mingguan jauh lebih terasa beda harganya, tapi kalau untuk tiket pesawat saya masih pakai Traveloka. | the best apps for travelling. mudah, cepat, dan selalu tidak mengecewakan...mantap Traveloka | Update: the dev reply and said they can't find my matching case although i called them 7 times. Just proofing my point that their apps is not good and not customer oriented. This apps dissapoint me, no helps whatsoever from their CS or internal team when they've been asked to. Only answered using template. Not recommended | Please do not book your stay from this app. Please. For your own sake. Room provided to me had no usable water facilities. This made my stay incredibly uncomfortable as access to clean water is a basic necessity. The hotel provided misleading information regarding the situation and lied about a complimentary gesture were never received. | very simple and helpfull for traveller üíô | Ok | Worst Service... Dont book your flight here.. It took a very long time to respond on your queries. Dont install this app please. | Salah order hotel karena kurang teliti lihat tanggal, bisa refund full. Mantab. Saran saya, bisa ditambahkan keterangan waktu yang dibold dan front yang mencolok misal merah supaya pelanggan tahu. Terima kasih | Your app its not detil for your customer | mi.min | user friendly good UI UX | The convenience fee is just too expensive per head. Had to uninstall it and just book in Agoda. Agoda is much better, it offer discounts with no convenience fee. | why the total price of flight kept changing when i want to pay, please give live update of the ticket price in the 1st page üò† | Check-in online loading terus ngga jelas, refund dari tgl 14 april sampe sekarang masih proses invalid rekening padahal rekening udah sesuai. | Shamsuddin Ahmad.l would be able at the way of my password to be able at the other use of my password to the other use of my password. | Pesan bus & shuttle, armada tidak datang, namun tidak ada tanggung jawab sama sekali | Ok | Skrg tiket dan voucher hotel harga paling mahal di bandingkan yg lain..,.. | Mau klik voucher koq ngga bisa. Kuota masih 13GB, pake wifi,pake restart hp,tetep tiap klik voucher selalu dibilang : Mohon Maaf Tidak Ada Koneksi Internet. Koq jd bego banget deh.Ngga ada update app juga.Jadi maksudnya gimana?Nyediain voucher tp ga bs diklik.ANEH | The best so far. Customer service very helpful. Highly recommended | Nice app | App keeps closing. Message appears that App has a bug. Wait till developers upload updates. Frustrating. | Aplikasi taik... Saya pakai traveloka paylater, saya beli tiket buat 4 orang pakai paylater. Tapi karena orang tua tiba-tiba sakit tiket di refund. Dan saya masih harus membayar tiket yang di refund itu. Sementara pembayaran pertama cicilan sudah saya bayar. Dan tidak dikembalikan. Masa tiket refund masih tetap harus dibayar. Hati-hati menggunakan traveloka paylater... | Shakeel Ahnad | I was unable to fly on the actual date,they didn't update me anything for the changes and blaming the airline for not updating Traveloka, I had to pay for all the expenses by myself, Traveloka is sooooo unresponsible, useless management üòë I wish I can rate for negative star... | Your unskipable ads on YouTube make me do this | I asked for a refund to and they give back 50% to my paylater. Then, I got one level down, which my limit decreased. Then, a few next days, I got level one more level down. And I don't have a limit anymore.. Am I fool here ? They tricked me like scammer | Jangan pakai aplikasi sampah ini. Saya kena penipuan berkedok penginapan. Waktu saya mengadu ke penyedia layanan hotel, disuruh ngomong sama orang Traveloka. Waktu saya ngomong ke Traveloka, dibilang ketersediaan kamar mengikuti dari penyedia. Tolong jangan bilang ngomong ke CS karena CS tidak bisa membantu. Alasannya karena pemesanan saya ""non-refundable"". Sudah begitu Traveloka dan penipu tidak bisa mengembalikan uang saya. Seakan Traveloka sengaja membiarkan penginapan yang ternyata penipu. | Aplikasi booking terbaik. Saya kecewa dg Traveloka Paylater saja. Saya selalu bayar tagihan tepat waktu. Tidak pernah menunggak pembayaran. Saya pakai Paylater tidak pernah melewati limit yg diberikan oleh Traveloka Paylater. Tetapi saya diturunkan grade saya terus menerus oleh Traveloka Paylater. Kalau memang limit yang diberikan tidak boleh dipakai semua knp harus diberikan limit. | Ga ada solusi terbaik... Untuk pembatalan tiket.. karena ada keluarga yg meninggal.. percuman nelpon minta solusi pembatalan.. yang dibaca dia SOP SoP terus.. | Confusing as hell.. Used to be a great app to book hotels, etc. Offers and rates no longer attractive, with too many restrictions. | Laporan 36955931, KACAU PIHAK TRAVELOKA SCAM GUA, BILANG BISA BELI TIKE ARCH PASS, TAPI MALAH UDAH MEPET BERANGKAT MALAH GABISA, PILIHANNYA REFUNDD KALO GA TAMBAH DUIT, NYALAHIN PIHAK SUPPLIER, CS CUMA BISA NYURUH NUNGGU SAMPE BERJAM2 TAPI UJUNG2NYA REFUNDSSS!! GAPUNYA TANGGUNG JAWAB, SEBUSUK ITU, NAJIS BGT CS NYA DAN TIM INTERNAL GA ADA SOLUSI, SOLUSINYA MALAH GUA BAYAR SENDIRI. KACAUUUUUUUU, TRAVELOKA SCAMMERRR!!!! Nyesel bgt pake aplikasi Scammer ini, ngerii, kacau bgt parahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! | Confusing app's | TIDAK AKAN PERNAH PAKE TRAVELOKA LAGI.... AUTO UNINSTALL.... SAYA PERNAH DITIPU PIHAK VILLA MEMAKAI APLIKASI INI.... MENDING PINDAH KE SEBELAH DEH YG LEBIH AMAN TRANSAKSI NYA | Tidak usah jual produk 100% refund, kalo alasan anda aneh saat saya minta refund malah ga dikasih. penipu | i booked the hotel but the hotel was closed and i can't refund | nice | Perfect | Sudah 2 kali dlm bbrp bulan ini penerbangan sy di batalkan yg mengharuskan sy untuk reschedule dengan tambahan biaya lg krn perbedaan selisih hrg tiket. Sungguh sangat mengecewakan | Pengalaman tidak menyenangkan dalam melakukan reschedule yang tidak diupdate statusnya oleh pihak traveloka sedangkan di pihak PO sudah tercatat dirubah tapi di aplikasi masih tidak terdapat perubahab sehingga terjadi miskomunikasi | FREE CANCELLATION IS NOT HONOURED! Made a hotel booking and cancelled for a full refund on the Android app 3 DAYS BEFORE the deadline. Even took a screenshot with date stamp making the second cancellation request as proof. Didn't get any email confirmation but it said refund being processed on the app. Now they tell me sorry, we can't give you the refund. Fix the app and do right by the clients. | pesen kamar 600k/malam pas checkin ke hotel mau open 1 kamar lagi harganya 350k/malam. Nanya concierge kok bs beda jg ga tau. Nice mark up hampir 100% | Standard lah, masih banyak yg lain yg lebih murah, thanks | The application not user friendly. Unable to view booking details. Error msg keep pop up ""something went wrong"". Poor service of application. | üëçüëçüëç | Userfriendly...good to have app for travelling | Pelayanan sangat bagus cepat tanggap keluhan | Setiap buka aplikasi selalu diminta update, pernah satu kali berhasil, ketika buka lagi beberapa hari kemudian diminta untuk melakukan update, namun gagal. Apakah ada solusinya? | I've been using this app a couple of years now its removing its over the counter payment it sucks | Terrible customer service and poor responsibility. My travel plans were ruined. Avoid this app and opt for other travel agents instead. This is my first negative review on Google Play, but the poor service compelled me to leave one. Awful experience! üò°üò° **Edit**After posting my review, Traveloka staff promptly responded within 2 hours. Why can't they solve my problem as quickly as they respond to reviews? | Cannot download to notebook only for mobile phone. Lousy and junk | Jika anda tidak ingin terror di tagih utang, jangan coba2 playlater nya deh.. Pengalaman pribadi saja, masa tenggang masih 7 hari udh di telpon2 terus.. yang paling parah pas masa tenggang masih 3 hari, di telp2 sampe 10x kayak udh kelewatan masa bayarnya saja Kapok banget pakai traveloka paylater, reminder nya bukan reminder biasa tapi nagih utangan ü§£ü§£ | Mudah dan cepat | Keren bgt pelayanan Traveloka. Saya pesan villa non refundable. Lalu pihak villa konfirmasi bahwa sebenarnya sudah penuh. Saya konfirm ke traveloka kemudian diberi penawaran relokasi atau refund. Pilihan relokasi di tempat yg tidak jauh dan dapat upgrade. Semua itu hanya berlangsung hitungan 1 jam. Komplain juga dibalas oleh cs, bukan robot. Gercep dan sangat solutif. | Promotions mostly are unclear and the policy is increasingly disadvantageous for users. | Hati hati bagi yg pakai fitur bayar dihotel.. nanti ditagih 2x sama Traveloka nya . | Gak bisa login.. üò≠ Kepental terus, kenapa?? | Jangan pernah pakai Traveloka lagi Saya sangat kecewa satu kali saya order hotel dan hotel tidak valid saya sudah berikan bukti bahwa saya sudah tiba di tempat dan sudah menelepon berkali kali namun hotel nya tidak ada, bukannya di refund dan dibantu solusi untuk banned tempat tidak valid malah dibalas dengan Traveloka tidak dapat bantu via email jangan pernah menggunakan aplikasi ini | this is so great ! | Can't log out of account. Keep logging automatically even though disable log Info. | Voucher diskon ngak bisa d pake mulu, kupon habis muluk | SCAMMER. THE BUG COSTS ME 2MIO AND THEY WOULDNT WANT TO REFUND MY MONEY. THEY BLAMED IT ALL ON ME. OH AND THE TEAM JUST ENDED THE LIVE CHAT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL SCAMMER . | aplikasi sangat membantu | Not good. | good | good apps, good recommendation, good prices | saya tidak bisa re- schedule untuk hotel dan tidak mendapatkan jawaban sesuai yang di sepakati, bad experience | App ini punya kebiasaan menyebalkan. Sering kali tiap dibuka langsung menawarkan menu penerbangan. Padahal aku mau booking hotel. Dan jika di-Back pun app nya malah menutup. Harus di-forced close baru bisa memilih menu booking hotel. | Hayoh we apdet | Very glitchy | Dikasih opsi refund, waktu upload e-receipt engga bisa terus. Dasar nipu | Great..f√†st respons,fast to solve a problem.thanks Traveloka and best wishes | Hati2 dengan paylater yg diberikan traveloka DC nya bengis sehari bisa diteror lebih dari 5 orang. TRAVELOKA PUNYA NAMA BESAR TETAPI BEKERJA SAMA DENGAN PIHAK PENAGIHAN YANG TIDAK SESUAI ATURAN | Bad experience for supporting team in Thailand | ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ | PAYAHH BANGET..APPS YG MEMILIKI PARTNER DGN APPS UANGKU YG TERNYATA UANGKU GA REPRESENTATIF BANGET, CALL CENTER NYA AJA GA BS BANTU KRN MEREKA MERASA BUKAN CALL CENTER UANGKU TAPI SMARTFREN, GIMANA ITU?????????SAYA HRS PASRAH TOP UP UANGKU TP HRS UPGRADE YANG HANYA BS DILAKUKAN OFFLINE ISI FORM????

CALL CENTER UANGKU ..MEMBUANG WAKTU DLM MENCOBA MENGHUBUNGI APPS UANGKU DAN TRAVELOKA..SAMA SAMA GA BS KASIH SOLUSI!!!!!APPS PAYAHHH | Saatnya pindah ke aplikasi lain buat booking tiket. Penerbangan di cancel sama maskapai lha uang yg kembali kok cuman sepertiganya. Saya gak minta refund tapi tiba-tiba di refund. Aplikasi gak jelas. Perbaiki dong komunikasi kalian jangan merugikan pelanggan | great app to book everything üåπüåπüåπ | On with | Good job | Tidak memberikan solusi yang terbaik untuk keluarga yang ditinggalkan. | Busuk | Can't do copy and paste, it is a pity. Plus my reservation made on a pc do not appear in the apps | Hati hati atas penawaran paylater nya itu jebalan batman karena mereka dengan suka suka menaikkan dan menurunkan level anda sehingga bunga yang anda tanggung lebih walaupun pemakaian anda bagus dan pembayaran anda bagus, saya minta untuk ojk untuk menutup semua paylater karena menyusahlan rakyat kecil | semoga ok | Makin g jelas ini aplikasi, mau bangkrut kali ini. Level turun terus, ingat ya tagihannya g akan pernah gw bayar lagi | Annoying ads | rekomendasi TDK bisa kecewa harga bisa bersaing service üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç | Intoleran! | Refund gk 100%, dapet untung dari hasil refund padahal maskapai yang cancel | Paylater nya buruk ! Selalu bayar tepat waktu, limit nya makin turun, gausah sedia in paylater kalo ga niat | Bug! There is a change in flight time. The app is doing great, it update the schedule. But when we tried to send pdf via email, it still print the 'old' schedule | CS tidak menjawab keluhan pelanggan. resch jadwal tanpa permintaan konsumen | Ga ada direct CS nya. Telepon smua ke bot. Lewat email balesnya lama banget. Kemaskapai malah cepet , urgent malah jd bikin stress. Lelet to the max | mudah dipesan | Check in online Traveloka tidak bisa pilih seat. dapat seat di posisi belakang & window.

Airlines change departure time so connecting flights are affected and to reschedule we have to agree to pay certain fees within a very limited time. Tried calling but all were answered by machines, no support staff. It's better to book your tickets using another travel agent. | joosss | fast service | Untuk pengiriman tiket, voucher atau tanda bukti pembayaran selain ke e-mail, perlu ditambah opsi ke Whatsapp, Telegram atau media lainnya. | System temporary error!!!! | Nu·ªët ti·ªÅn th√¨ nhanh, nh·∫£ ti·ªÅn th√¨ nh√¢y nh·ªõt :))) ƒë√∫ng b·ªçn t∆∞ b·∫£n | Suka sekali transaksi dg traveloka | Bad Service | the best apps | Even I finished my payment. the app show pending payment. So I thought I have not pay. So I make payment again. Now I pay twice for same flight. Call customer service. The lady is impatient, talk like a rapper.

I'd been member since 2014. thanks for the service | Very very bad | Pelayanan buruk bgt!!!!!

Pls put back the over the counter option for payment method.. Im so sad for thatüòîüò¢ | Very helpful | Evil management deserves no support | When i login always error.please upgrade some more info about this app | A waste of my time! This app promises flash sales, discounts, and promos for a certain period of time. However, after waiting for a long time, all the prices in this app remain unchanged and expensive. | alhamdulillah.. useful & simple interseting app.. | Traveloka makin lama makin kyk anj*ng.. Mau chat ketemunya robot.. Mau telp ga ada tombol untuk berbicara dengan manusia.. Jualan tiket tp pelayanan makin kyk anj*ng | Nice | Good | Semalam saya membeli tiket penerbangan dan karena glitch dari app menyebabkan double-issued tickets. Saya coba menghubungi customer service, tapi pihak traveloka tidak mau bertanggung jawab sama sekali dan mengarahkan saya untuk refund dengan alasan pribadi, yang menyebabkan pemotongan sebesar 25 persen dari harga tiket Ps: Masalahnya sampai sekarang belum teratasi, jangan menyampaikan hal yg tidak benar | Traveloka dulu saya percaya karena kemudahan dalam transaksinya. Saya kecewa karena beberapa kali booking hotel harganya lebih mahal daripada bayar langsung di hotelnya, bisa sampai 50%. Fasilitas yg tertulis juga tidak sesuai. Tidak bisa dipercaya | Found bug when purchasing hotel using credit card. After inputting 3D secure OTP, the transaction success, but the page stuck on ""Payment"" step, even when I already got the ""Ticket issued"" notification; I need to close the page manually to access my e-ticket. Please fix it as it impacts user experience, thanks. | saya memiliki pengalaman buruk setelah booking hotel dari aplikasi, saat mau checking pihak hotel menolak memakai pembayaran via aplikasi. | easy & simple | Satya | Clunky interface and challenging navigation make using WanderEase frustrating. Nonexistent customer support leaves travelers stranded during critical moments. Overall: WanderEase disappoints with its outdated interface, inefficient booking process, and lack of reliable customer service. | mantull | Worst company. Duit gw ilang gara2 beli tiket myairline yg bangkrut skrg pake traveloka paylater(dan harus bayar tagihan paylater). Hati2 guys | agak ribeud n ngga bisa pake QR | No live agent. When the airline canceled and rerouted your flight you are doomed as they do not send the new itenerary. It's scary when your flight is so near because their costumer service is very slow. | Aftersales service nya kacau.. hubungi CS, semua di reply oleh Bot. | Kupon diskon nya abis mulu ya gimana, Worst app | mau pesen travel pulang pergi error terus | Simple aplication to use, thanks | Terimakasih.. sangat membantu dalam pekerjaan saya.. | good service | Tidak bisa menghubungi customer service. Jadi bagaimana mau komplain? | pemesanan sangat mudah | page were busy with promos and discounts, the discounts will not work with non Indonesian card. Such as BS and hassle | Tidak pernah ada promo yang bisa digunakan. Semua sudah sesuai S&K tapi tetap error, lalu tiba2 kuota telah habis. Update : Tiket lebih mahal, lebih baik langsung beli di aplikasi airasia / web airasia | Gagal issued tiket hotel setelah bayar, dikasih pilihan ambil kamar lain secara gratis atau refund, tapi kamar lain gratis nya tanpa sarapan, rugi dong, akhirnya pilih refund, ternyata diproses dalam 3-5 hari, rugi lagi dong, nggak ada perbaikan nih traveloka, kebanyakan info promo yg gak perlu pula üòÆ‚Äçüí® | Traveloka nya bagus, bintang lima, sengaja dikasih bintang satu biar yang lain aware, jangan beli asuransi hotel nya chubbs, ga akan dibayar, saya pesan hotel dan ga bisa masuk alasannya macam2 endingnya ga dibayar. Uang kecil tapi mending buat beli cilok saja | Lousy app, prices are higher than almost all the competitors. No point advertising on cars and motorcycles and then having exorbitant prices more than fifty percent higher than competitors. This is a waste of mobile data bandwidth to download. | Sudah cancel booking tapi basic point sebanyak 300000 tidak kembali, padahal seharusnya kembali, sudah lapor customer service tapi sudah lebih dari 30 menit tidak ada jawaban sama sekali, hanya bot saja yg jawab, sangat mengecewakan | Service nya gak bagus, dibandingkan dg Agoda. | custermer servicesnya ribet kalo ada masalah,aplikasi payletternya sering ngeheng dan ga update kl ada masalah refund nya lama banget | üíñüéäüíØ‚úÖ | usefully apps | cepat respon | helpfull app | amazing | easy booking | baru mau masuk aja gabisa klik lanjutkan, ganti bahasa dari Bahasa Indonesia ke English aja juga gabisa. hadehh | give 5 stars because the boss care about their employees | very helpful when travelling | thx u | Always make it easy & fast | Kecewa dgn traveloka, tdk menghargai customer, dan lebih prcy ke po bus yg tdk bertanggung jwb. Saya pesan bus di traveloka, kita di pindah ke bus lain sebanyak 2 kali, dan bus terakhir PO nya tdk jelas. (tdk memiliki trayek, sehingga penumpang tdk diturunkan di terminal purabaya tetapi di dpnnya) buruk, saya tdk akan mengulangi lagi naik bus ini. Po bus alasan masalah teknis, klu masalah teknis knp harus di pindah sampai 2 kali ke bus lain. Dan bus terakhir tdk ad trayeknya | harga tiket 1.3 pas mau checkout tiba-tiba berubah jadi 1.8.

So I tried to book a hotel room, the app told me to put my debit card info, and nothing happened. It's just said I need to verify my card. which I did. | Apps anj**g, sangat susah utk kontak cs yg manusia. Semua dijawab robot.

Had to cancel hotel reservations due to fight cancelation. Contact the hotel and cancel reservations with no problems and received an email confirmation from the hotel. Also contacted Agoda about cancelation. Agoda still charged my credit card . After several weeks dealing with Agoda customer service of trying to get a refund, I had to file a dispute . I will never book with Agoda . | exceptional | Agoda is nothing more than scam website. I booked hotel in Vrindavan and paid full amount in advance and booking was confirmed but at the time of check-in they denied me for providing the room nor they refunded my amount. I tried to contact to Agoda helpline but contact number was not working. Till date there's no response from Agoda. Suggest you to don't book room from this SCAM WEBSITE. | nice | Descent service | great discounts cpmpared to other apps! | BEWARE!!!! Please be careful using this App. Your credit and/or bank details are not safe and secure. I had an issue where agoda attempted to use my Mastercard and Local on the same day. | fantastic | quick cancellation | Unbelievably bad. I can't contact both the host of the hotel and the customer support service of Agoda. Nothing is working properly | always check agoda before booking at other apps.. 9 out of 10 times.. agoda gives best prices.. | Awesomeness!!! | good price user friendly | Easy booking, best prices & and risk-free | good app | Worst first time experience ever. Booked yesterday, then this morning I checked the booking still under process. Then at night time which is just now. I check my booking and it had been cancelled. So I thought that they will refund it asap. Then, I checked my bank account ofc there's a transaction of paying it but no history of refund. Then I chat with the customer service, very dissapointed. There's only auto generate robot who's the one reply me. | Superbly Application | The best travel site | Very nice hotel | always quick easy and good prices. ---- | This app is fraud, No show from hotel and customer care. | my feveret apps | good. fast. and reliable. | Agoda is fantastic!! The service provided by Agoda is top notch. They provide stellar deals on hotels. They resolved my accommodation issue professionally and incredibly fast (within 1 hour since I booked and walked into my hotel). I will be using agoda for all my accommodation needs in the future. I urge everyone to use them too! Stellar service here! | I had booked hotel room from Agoda but the owner said you have to pay more to stay and there was neither any way to cancel room and neither there is any contact detail of Agoda so I had paid 200 rs more to stay in hotel. Such a poor management by agoda | good job | excellent | awesome promotion all the time | awesome üòé | good | Not helpful with bouble booking issue due to app delay. Property was willing to do the date chance abd cancellation but Agoda was not flexible | good | nice deal | been using this website since 2014, never looked elsewhere | Easy to book and cheaper price at the best hotel! | Good | Good App but maybe can be simplied more | excellent | the best rates in the town | ive had use 2 times for booking hotels and the price its different, when i check in, the receptionist told that the price on the agoda too cheap, so i should add my money to check in, why u post the different price between apps and the hotel????? | very good interface somple to book | very nice üëç | this is a great app for hotel booking | aflatoon platform | best app best deals | The best | Promo clickbait, belum lagi aplikasi error | thanks u | good price | Easy breezy | great! | good app | Very poor first three minute experience with more popups than I could tap away.

I am hearing first time about this app. | Best application for staying | great experience | okay | very useful | Good and sale | worst follow up after hotel booked. no booked property number to contact and also stupid AI custom service really useless. Agoda getting worse | Agoda is a great site to use, good discounts, plenty of accommodation to pick from, only downside is customer service is overseas and very very slow to respond, bit of a language barrier with any issues, apart from that still the most preferred site and loyalty discounts for the more trips you book. | Don't ever use this app! I booked a room paid for it, the payment sent directly to this app. And when trying to contact the number provided in the booking confirmation its unattended couldn't reach the contact number. Scammers are roaming into this app. | why pay later to get cash back and with condition, not feeling safe . | calling option to hotel | my best app for booking hotels | very good app for bookings. | The cashback reward is a scam, i waited for 1 year and haven't received anything | Very quick and easy. | Agoda is my go to hotel booking app | Good prices for hotels. Easy to use & reserve rooms | good application | good | Do not book to this app. Lots of scammers! Book directly to property | sometimes the confirmation is suppperrr delayed. so i got double booking rsv later on. and it is so annoying to cancel the latest one, since it is difficult to do it. please update the system so it wont happen again and make guests confused. | Wrost App cancellation policy is worst | Agoda was not honest about the cancelation policy. Agoda told me that they would use my credit card to reserve the room, but when I canceled the hotel charged me 17%. | Too many popups and ads. No option to dismiss them all. It makes using mobile to manage bookings incredibly difficult and I was given yet another popup asking me to leave a review and I had to leave one star. Shameful. | Very Bad Service.Not giving any Discount or Offer for New Customers for First Booking | Quite misleading app. You search for a date range (like 7 days from now). They give you a good price (the daily price without telling it is the daily one) and when you gonna close the deal, you get the total price. Quite misleading app and website. | good | It took 2 months to get my money back. Then I had to ring them and they said it was a computer glitch. Scam | good | yerlah mantap | The worst service of its kind. Booked and confirmed a hotel reservation for 2 weeks in 10/2023. Two separate but consecutive bookings, for I qualified for a discount for a few more days after confirming the first one, so I thought why not? Huge mistake. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk staff couldn't find my booking despite showing my confirmation email. I had to call CS to sort things out myself. The same thing happened to my consecutive booking. Forever blacklisted and never again. | thank you | best option | Hotels promoted on apk website are worthless and not verified. What images show and what actually is are poles apart. U cannot cancel nor u can get refund. Just have to stay in cramped dirty places promoted on site as very good and with best possible services blah blah blah | excellent service | The only app in my phone that lags. | perfect | easy to proceed | nice | user friendly, great discount | Very worst fraud amount cheering this app room booking but no hotal and that address fraud person fraud app 5000 loss | üëçüèº | realy nice hotel application | Amount debited in November month still refund not received | good | Good site, best prices, recomend | Vv nice application | AGODA IS PATHETIC (in India).. Never use AGODA.. YOUR HOLIDAY WILL BE RUINED.... very bad experience. I had booked a homestay in Ooty thru Agoda, I got the confirmation email and messages as well. When we 2 families with kids reached ooty and called the homestay he says they have given it someone else. When I called agoda they said sorry and will give me cashback of 5 to 10%.

Se | Travellers beware of booking through Agoda App. There system is utter nonsense and their customer support is the worst ever. They will just keep you on hold forever and come back with no resolution. They will disconnect the call and when you call back you will have to explain the issue again to a new person. I had booked a trip to Sakleshpur, in their app it's showing booking paid and confirmed but when I called the property I am told there is no such booking. #Pathethic #AgodaFraud #StayAway | I have been using Agoda for about 5 years now. I have to say that service is really bad. I suffered losses due to their booking errors and they refuse to reimburse you for the full amount of your losses. The star system on the hotels is not accurate. The 5 Stars are okay but I would lower by 1 Star the ones below. I also feel the rooms they negotiate are not the best rooms at the hotel they're the ones that most clients don't want. | good | Nice one | Refund lama gila | I had been using Agoda for well over a decade and recently I am thinking about deleting the whole app. Even I had booked rooms, I get constant spams and annoying notifications to book my rooms and it's getting really freaking annoying. | Helpful | Do not use Agoda.

The customer support are bunch of liars. They provide no support and try to mislead | excellent rate compared to others üëç | Cannot sign in its terrible and this whole. Robot thing is madining | Super bad experience, booked few hotels with agoda, 1 overcharged my credit card despite the amount stated in the app is lower. Contacted the support but told me to check with the bank myself.

Because it saves your money and satisfies your budget-friendly trip. | easy to use and good prices for numerous attractions | Easy to book activities. Also,there are many available discount vouchers that can be used for booking. ü•≥ | The booking process was easy to navigate as both confirmation and cancellation due to change of itinerary was never an issue. | This app provides limited experiences for a limited number of locations. | KLOOK WILL CHEAT YOUR MONEY! took my payment when the amusement park is closed. I had to find out on my own and when i contacted customer support they immediately said NO CANCELATION. RM460 taken without providing a service. | i love u klook | Worst experience.Spent a huge some of money for booking the attractions but the customer service is pathetic. Tried to explain multiple times the issue but they don't get it and ask to explain the same again and again. | easy to use | Terrible customer service! Promised to respond to me in 24-48 hours but they did after 5 days yet they did not resolve my concern. Also, the app does not fully disclose important terms/conditions of a booking, so a customer is not fully informed of the provisions of an offer booked. Company is just about making profit and doesn't really care about customer satisfaction! | Great app | It was really pleasant experience with the bookings from Klook app. We had almost planned 90 percent of Da Lat city, Vietnam trip with this app. | Easy to use and offers a lot of discounts | Poblam k | great app, easy to book tours and so far the tours and guides have been excellent. | Good service üëç, I like this app | No flexibilty to customers. Book somewhere else or use another app | easy to use | user friendly | fast and save service | I had purchased Hakone 2-day free pass and Tokyo Skytree tickets from Klook and it was a breeze buying and using them. I will definitely use Klook again in the future. | Easy to book such a variety of things. Very useful | My go to app whenever I travel locally or internationally | ÂçÅÂàÜ‰æøÂà©ÁöÑËªü‰ª∂ÔºåÊü•ÁúãÊîªÁï•‰πüÂæàÊúâÁî®ÔºåÂπ´Â§ßÂøô‰∫ÜÔºÅ | I recently booked a 14,000-foot skydive through Klook for $320, only to find it cheaper directly from the provider‚Äî$218 online and $265 on-site. Despite Klook‚Äôs Best Price Guarantee(joke) my request for a refund of the price difference was denied due to a slight difference in cancellation policies. The skydiving site offers more flexible cancellations than Klook claims, yet my claim was still rejected. This has been a disappointing experience with a platform I previously trusted. Shame on them. | good application, easy to use | Fast and easy to use the voucher | all went smoothly | Excellent app for booking activities etc, used it many times to make bookings and haven't had any issues redeeming vouchers etc. | easy to uses | if you want to have a nice vacation... use Klook | They are just thieves. I booked Shinkansen tickets for 191 USD. 10 seconds later I get the confirmation. another 10 seconds later I get a CANCELLATION confirmation! without any explanation. they automatically refunded 171 USD. I suppose they kept the rest as their ""service fee"". For a service they didn't provide! reported to PayPal (glad I didn't use a credit card!). This isn't just a bad app, this is fraud. | Bookings were seamless. Highly recommend. | Great app! easy to use | Very helpful in travelling! | easy to use and navigate. I took advantage of my Klook credits to get a discount on our Umeda sky building tickets. | Very good ‚ò∫Ô∏è | good discount | great app | Nice | easy to navigate | Terrible! So disappointing! The operator cancelled our tour when everything was ready but it's fine atleast they assured us that we will get the full refund but the thing is until now there is no refund given until now!!!! So frustrating they easily deduct money but if it's all about refund time they are so slowwwwwwww!!!!! When in fact it is not my fault I did not cancel it myself!!!!! I'm so Pissedddddd offfff!!!! Update:OMG! Really scammnmmmmm! until now they did not give my money back!!!!! | Klook made planning our trip to Japan so much easier :) | perfct easy to ues same orginal prices amizing | Booked a Shinkansen ticket and then received a cancellation email 3 minutes later. The ticket amount got refunded but Klook did not refund the booking fee. | Extremely happy with the overall UI of the app and of availing services booked via Klook. Had a wonderful experience using the app on my recent trip outside India. | Good app | Book activities here. Great value for your money. They give receipts also for documentation. Good deals with meals in the activities | Informative and easy to use | Flexible n Convenient. | Great app and very good selection of activities | Convenient & a lot of saving in travel activities | good | Best experience ever with all my bookings. | Charged my credit card $600 for a purchase I never made. Now I have to contact bank and try and get my money back. BEWARE!!! | best app for booking attractions tickets | Always a bargain when looking for activities on our vacation. App had a great UI & UX. | makes everything easier | easy to use and reliable. price is competitive too | very easy to use | good | used for tickets and transfer works all super easy :) | Easy to navigate and purchase the ticket... but the administration fee will be added up to the price... | Klook Team must be more Kind in understanding concerns, I demanded refund next day as I couldn't complete a trip I booked. Due to my Hotel issues & concerns. I asked them I couldn't go there because I had to change my hotel last minute due to staff of hotel misbehaved & didnt cooperate at all. I also send them booking of same day proof. But they have not yet responded to my concern. I feel really bad & think of Travellers with similar experience. Hopefully I get my refund. | Value for money üí∞ | easy to use | They said if I download the app, I would get a 10% off code. Downloaded the app, signed in, no discount code.... | user friendly. instance confirm | user friendly. very easy to use | fast and easy navigate | so handy for overseas travelling!! | its great and handy. love the interface | easy to use. love the app especially the price compare to other | interesting and easy to find anything i need.. | Worst app ever. I can't book single things every time it's getting declined by app. And even customer support is worst. They are not even want to understand the problem. | I really love Klook | Awesome app. Can book any activities, get sim card or travel card etc. | Hey there! Just wanted to share my experience with the Suica Card I got for my Japan trip. It was super handy! I picked it up right at Haneda Airport after landing, thanks to Klook. No hassle at all. This card was a lifesaver. I used it on trains, buses, and even when I grabbed snacks from the convenience stores. It's accepted pretty much everywhere, which is awesome. So, if you're heading to Japan, I'd say definitely grab a Suica Card. It makes getting around so much easier, and you won't hav | liking it so far! | Very reliable app! Thanks, Klook for such amazing deals. | Horrible. i was just asking an agent in their costumer service if i can get a refund their agent told me that they can't make a refund but if a buy two more extra tickets they'll process it for me but didnt do it. agents are scamming people here don't ask for their help | best apps for japan trip | Quick confirmation | easy | very helpful apps | easy to use, good value | very user friendly | the initial promo code for first time user did work. | Will book again.. Best app | Always check the pricing.but so far it has been great | so much simpler than trying to buy tickets for the USJ website | I have to give it 2 stars because when it works, it works. For tours and attractions it is great. But for transportation, beware. When something goes wrong support is not helpful. | good | Good so far! | easy peasy | Klook is the best! | good | Excellent | Bookings made easy. Love this app! | So far it seems very good and easy to use for booking things in Japan | very helpful appsüëå üëè | great app, reliable for booking a trip to Japan with a Canadian credit card. | Great apps ever | well this app help me alot. love it. helpline also work great. | Hassle free booking. | great prices, easy to use, and convenient | easy to use | easy to use | easy to use | pls improve your CS. no one's responding to me. | very accomodating | great! | excellent app | harga lebih murah berbanding walk in | excellent apps | The best travel apps as always! | One of the best apps for traveller | Very easy to use. | love this app for booking tours and tickets to excursions. would highly recommend. | very easy to use | used my klook credits to make the esim purchse cheaper! | Great app easy n fast | the service is good and trusted,driver arrived and drop on time | Nice interface | great place to look for great deals | Great deals! | very easy and helpful | great | It's all fun and good until you have to cancel your trip and wait for a month for the money to be refunded. I cancelled my trip because you cant reschedule it without cancelling the first date. And after that, you have to repay and wait for the first payment to be credited on your account. It's been exactly a month and yet no updates yet! I always talk to your customer support and all they say is to wait. How much more do I have to wait??? Edit:Support just said me now to wait. AGAIN. JUST WOW. | mohon dapat ditambah pilihan pembayaran melalu transfer bank | A lot of discounts | So easy to book with and from experience, easy to make changes and cancel/refund if needed. | very good instant tickit booking | Seamless and Easy as 123... | Great when things work. But don't expect CS to be able to help when there are issues. | simple | good | We have a wonderful, exciting & unforgettable experience in Desert Safari Tours in Dubai. Muhammad Umair is very kind & attentive. He support & guide us from the start of our tour till the end. He was always there to help us. Thank you so much for your guidance. | It's a really easy app and worth purchasing with a discount price. Highly recommended. | cheaper than other websites...worth it.. | the best | sangat mudah digunakan | After being 35 year's with a competitor's, I am pleasingly surprised with Klook. Customer service much better, Few minor details for improving to 5 stars. While booking the customer should get the option to pay at arrival, while the card is being used to secure booking. | Good apps | bisa booking H-1, really convenience | quick and flexible | Booked the shinkansen and received a confirmation email, however the booking doesn't appear in the app. The link in the email always redirects me to a page that says ""busy"".

I really need my money back | It keeps crashing plus priceline cheaper anyway | All the prices and options in one place makes it so much easier to find what I need. | I love ir | They make it very EASY for the user, thank you. | First use and love it so far | This App has saved me tons of money so far | Efficiant personal assistant of travel in am app! I literally got step by step instructions at real time. Hopper informed me of the gate change before the Airport monitor. Excellent experiance. | Excellent | Customer service is terrible. Not worth paying the extra money for being able to talk with a live agent. There very unhelpful and barely understand you. Also don't pay extra for the delays or cancellation insurance, they don't honor it and make you jump through hoops with false unlisted information or put you on hold for 45 minutes at a time hoping you will hang up. | Have been using Hopper in conjunction with a number of other flight comparison apps, and it is just so easy, with CLEAR information at a glance. It continues to be and WILL continue to be a mainstay in my travel-app arsenal! | Always found good flight ticket prices. Great customer support. App is sometimes unstable while booking tickets. Sometimes it needs a couple of retry before you can book your tickets. | I can count hopper | Update: back to working as usual and I'm back to watching my flights!! I love this app and often recommend to friends. But I just went to check on my flights and it's crashing so badly it won't even open! | Excellent experience, great discounts on hotels in any area, and much more. Hopper is my goto when traveling. A true must have app. | So far so good! I need to post more about needing a deposit from motels on the website and no rent rooms for quality service. | Very bad | Great deals and nice user experience | Awesome deals | This app is super easy to use | Easy process, really friendly platform. | Great, easy to use | Fun and good deals easy to use | Found a bit more reasonable prices on hotels. Some r Sam's as other sites but a lot are cheaper | Love it | Saves money and helps to see the town. Random price drops always fun | Provides helpful information to plan trips | easy to find flights | I like that this app helps you to determine the best time to pay to get the best price | Customer service ordered me the wrong room | Almost five stars because I remember when I used to booked rooms here ranging from 30 to 50 bucks a night. Whatever happened to real good deals like those? | excelente herramienta | One stop flight shopping | I love that you can watch a flight to see if and when the price will go down. | Love the perks and low rate | Pretty much worthless | Great information and choices | So far so good, I'm watching rates on a flight to see my son in September, I'm waiting for the lowest price and then buying | Very good app | Stopped showing price predictions...which was the main reason I used the app. | Ok | Great deals! | The worst company to try and deal with. They took out money for an Air Asia flight from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur. Air Asia cancelled all flights from Auckland as they weren't going to operate out of Auckland anymore. Neither Hopper not Air Asia contacted us to inform us the flight was cancelled. The day of our expected departure, we tried to check in to our flight only to find out it was cancelled. Neither Hopper or Air Asia is doing anything to refund us. Do not use Hopper! | Fav travel app | Best app ever | Amazing | Used it a few times and it's pretty smooth. | So easy to book and the is reasonable | No multi city option for Android while iOS has it. No news on when it will be available for Android. Updated request: I saw a flight available for less on airlines site but couldn't find it on Hopper. The chat feature is useless because I can't chat to anyone without a booking, although I would like to book on Hopper (capital one travel) and so would like to understand why it's not showing up on Hopper. | Great Easy to use Love the keep watching tool | I love it üíû | Horrible company who scams you by making places look nice even though they are drug and bug infested with everything falling apart | I've been using Hopper for years! They have live customer service now! Woo Hoo... it just keeps getting better! | I use Hopper for all my hotel reservations. I've been beyond pleased. Best rates and best places@ | I used it before for another trip and it was wonderful. Planning a new trip right now but I found better deals just googling. Super disappointing. | My flight got cancelled and I did not receive any email from the airline and from Hopper. Horrible. | Horrible customer experience. Use a better app/company. They steal your money. | It's a great app | No savings. SCAM | Love the app. Helps find the best prices | Great | Used 6 times, so far so good. | Help u a lot when need | Best flight costs ever | Great app | Excepcional app, user friendly | I love the fact of how the conserve our wildlife by planting trees each rental | Reliable and helpful. Flights were canceled last minute for cousin's wedding on Cancun 3 yrs ago. Agent found me a new flight arriving only an hour later than original flight. Used hopper ever since | Good | Great Hotel prices | I get great rewards with little effort. I love it¬∞ | Good info. Like the notifications | This rocks | Very helpful with getting the best price for a flight | Reserved a car and a couple of hotel rooms from the app for a vacation with my girlfriend to Canada with no issues. I love all of the filters they have for finding a place that suits your needs. I also love the feature of viewing the hotel reservations as icons on the map, so you can be as close as possible to attractions! | Hopper has been my greatest travel companion for myself and other close friend and relatives.. takes no time to find what I am looking for and continue to watch my prices ss i make decision on when a good time to purchase . I actually paid $38. Round trip tickets from Austin TX to Newark NJ.. | Might be the worst customer service on the planet, even when you pay extra for the VIP support. If you ask for a manager they just end the chat. Refuse to answer basic questions. | Hit and miss for finding deals but it's better than doing it yourself | I only downloaded this app because I have two rabbits and I thought it was cute, I didn't expect the service to be as good as it is. From projected price calculations, good recommendations and great deals, this service provides options for anybunny to explore. | Awesome App! Ever since I came across this app, I've been using it for all my trips. Best deals! | Great. The resort fee is not disclosed so you never know the exact price | Save money,try to buy tickets from delta app and was more expensive than hopper so I really recommended. And the plant a tree if you buy from themü•∞ | easy to use... | Takes the headaches out of traveling. | Cool need all airlines | No problems with the app. Very easy to use. | Very user friendly and trustable. I've crossed referenced prices every time I bought a ticket through Hopper (booked around 10 flights through the app) and each time the prices are either similar or lower, but the key part is all the prices are upfront through this app. It's very direct with the information given, and also offers packages that can be very useful such as trip protection and things of that nature. Would highly recommend if you are looking at traveling. Thanks guys! | It can help you find an airplane, it can help you find a hotel, it can help you find a restaurant, and even a car, BUT it will not put them all together. YOU must buy them all separately. There is no such thing as an all inclusive trip with Hopper. I even called their support line and it could not even help me... | I'm yet to use it but o ly heard good things | ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô | I love hopper! | Love that you can search multiple airlines in one place. | Smithfield stopv | Hopper saved my life! | Stay away from this app, I booked a hotel in Va and upon my arrival and check in I noticed that there were people hanging outside doing drugs, pushing shopping carts etc. I immediately attempted to contact customer service and realized that was a fee. I contacted my Uber and Bonvoy Marriott and hot tailed it out of there. | Scam .They take your money even if the reservation is denied. Anyone else want to start class action | My experience was awesome absolute fantastic | Never disappoints! Trust worthy and reliable.. 10/10 recommend | I'm able to find amazing trips at better prices then other locations I go to one site and I'm very happy there and that is Hopper!! | I love that it watches the prices for you. Got a round trip ticket for the St. Patrick's Day holiday for 700 dollars with insurance! | Excellent | Awesome, Quick, easy and fast APP | Best' app | always best prices | Best | ""Cheapest"" ok lmao your price scale won't even move down past $75 for the min per night!! Even though you guys were smooth enough to leave that portion visible. Really nailing this guys üëç | Awesome | It is my go to when searching for flights further down the road. | Hopper had great low prices, I like when I'm notified of price changes | Am Extremely Happy üòä | This is the worst flight booking app One can use.. Guys, if you are reading this, then please save your valuable time and Money.. | So far so good and the best | No problems at all!! | Good | On the app it shows me a price than when I go to book it it's myself and 2 other people the app says there's 6 seats available than when I push to go to the payment window it says error so I call hopper and she walks me thru everything and we get to the same point and it says error and than she says there s no seats available while the whole time it's showing 6 seats available even when she tries to walk me through it | Great app! I always use it to determine when to buy my tickets. | Awesome! Very helpful with the predicted prices. | Always seem to have the best prices and refunds your ticket or gets you on the next flight if things go wrong | Great deals | Super easy to find what I'm looking for and usually they have great deals. | Very nice üëçüèª | GREAT DEALS & EASY TO USE (And I'm a Senior Citizen) üòÅ | Usually has pretty good deals | Where It's Hoppening | Love it...something different from the usual booking sites | Great for upcoming travel planning! | Its of good use | Love this app | Have gotten incredible deals on this app | P good | love using this app to book flights | Easy to use app, great prices and the customer service is actually pretty good if you need assistance. | Always good price | Good app to have and saved a lot of money on rooms. | I had good experiences with app, this helps me telling ticket prices and predictions. | It is easy to find flights. | Good | I like seeing all my options in one place, the customer benefits and Watch notifications. | Very informative on booking flights at best prices | Really user friendly, great deals always!! | Good | I end up getting charged twice,though. Hopper and the motels Don't communicate, so we book a room got king instead of two queen's. Then hoppers card wouldn't work for the room they ran my Discover card as a back up card. I called hopper support, they said they fixed everything, mind you this 11.00pm at night so I am dog tired. Next day I double check everything good, I got confirmation from a different front desk lady that we were good to go. Got charged twice. What a headache and waste of time | Look around and find good deals. | Finds you cheaper travel options. As advertised. | Good | Hopper always give me the best deals ans they are so diligent and helpful when I need them. Thank you! | Get the travel delay insurance It paid for my trip !! | Thanks for helping me... | Mega useful for trip booking! | Even though I booked what appeared to be a refundable flight, the app kept offering additional coverage packages, even stating the flight was non refundable | üëçüëç | User friendly | Peace and quietly | Easiest site I use while planning trips. | Love it just that when freez it says price stays the same when it does not. But other wise then that its great app | Works great and very helpful. I am in disbelief in the price I get on flights sometimes and the options they have to save money if the flight is delayed or cancelled are great too. | I love hopper It saves you time and money. | Love using it since 2021 find great deals. As a Travel Business owner I also suggest to my clients flying domestically, Mexico, to the Carribean. | Great app | Awesome discounts | Great | Great and easy to use | Easy to use. Quick way to find the best prices for most airlines, hotels, and rental cars. | We have used Hopper for hotels, flights, and. Cars, and have never had a issue. Great deals. | When it's come to customers services always took a long time for reply....when i want to cancel flights I have to subscribe the VIP so that I can ask the customer service which is cost a lot of money.....flight and seat in different prices... I'm gonna uninstall it... | Very easy to use and reliable! | Love it and it's easy to use | This site is horrible. They make false bookings try at your own risk. | just the simplicty of it all | It's not too easy to navigate | Awesome | Awesome | Excellent app. Great prices. | Great app to get great deals | Someone mentioned this app on CBS News so I figured it must be good, but boy was I wrong. To put it nicely, it doesn't work. No instructions on how to use it or anything. | I just wish the hold price whatever you pay even if it expires you should be able to put that credit toward the new price","{""1"":15585,""2"":5195,""3"":10390,""4"":20780,""5"":81388}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Hopper Inc.","Hopper+Inc.","help@hopper.com","https://www.hopper.com",,"https://hopper.com/legal/privacy-notice","Hopper+Inc.","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wlYIPXC8F0EFUPAqP0FdjveY0BoEoa4y3hVAM5pwRtmzp1AXiWZpMCvklouZgvurLtw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LqhKi_WgZ-j8lBS9aZeCGsfXN1_JjFB9HaCz40cJ99FvRGNSYLhF089NBQP0yrJxrbI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RuKlzt6yt6O41sxih1jRGR4rS_4C8hvqIhKlGqhg5V9VSzxVf-xMXMpki3qRFqqRZg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SwYwjWBDBZcIwx6MTMVNXYch7LzzuQxPobRBEXsnBtY9WB8K3gdy4nGy-kmcn1WxAces"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qLBbn2ujvPOLZhlT1saBod4vc3ooxm6jE2f4aHh6V1onsmLgaHZzZ44r_Fwt5MXdiCs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H6tDU7x4zbwI6rulpdBT2gfVgGDSKP2r4iA0qrYMcJkjifw5_tDD6mIzXhzqFlVoKQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KQa6is5Z8bLsPu0txseOv1IVqgxgkAT8ZEyxI-y08-jYUEkfkd3UZ_ARwgsUjyYk2Vw9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X-GIe6oJ1j-Ax3a--23zuvY5q_XiC2gDvIkmGYp1vF9tVmcs7XTgGyO13QY7wRTqd9k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b3RMD6jhmhnu8oUd3S0_zi-iveg_WKiue2Wjr5qIGPmSXg9H47NdJrVgg51I_YxASfo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Le15I1oFZWqvnCY3Siu5A1UxIOKyDjcG2rQ2HVdwJwr6cF7uOLnh_9AjPnX93-RfgjgN""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Aug 30, 2015",1713572604000,"5.58.0","Bug fixes and UI improvements<br>","[null]",false,false,false,"com.hopper.mountainview.play","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hopper.mountainview.play&hl=en&gl=CZ"

Due to timing and other constraints I did not read Google reviews 1.6 of the hotel and booked it on OYO falling prey to the 5 rating on OYO!! The location was wrong and l was roaming around searching in a paid cab . No one picked the phone called from the booking.

It was a bulk booking for 5 rooms. Customer support asked me to pay 1800+ INR via a UPI link and paid. Hotel management denied my checkin and denied my amount refund. Now the reason for not returning is I have contacted them very late and policy say don't give money back to customers if we give complaint after 7 days.

Very Satisfactory | Worst experience ever I plan for vacation in gangtok I booked hotel I paid also when I reached property they don't have Oyo contact I m new here and they don't give me relocation also I stuck in gangtok at 7pm night I travelled from 24 hours and now facing this type of issues never book from Oyo very very bad experience. | Very bad experience, the hotel gave us non ac room at the price of ac and other amenities and didn't give even water. I'll never recommend my family and friends for booking rooms from oyo.,They charged extra money at hotel rather than what is shown on the app. Hotel even say that they don't take booking from oyo because oyo had not given them money. | excellent | good | Oyo is a scam.

In addition, why can't you add a government discount? | convenient and easy to use | Amazingly easy to shop travel & book a room!!! | love it | refundable.options | free thank you | got 15$ off my hotel with this app from rewards from only one night previously! easy to apply and easy to navigate. I think it's really a little cheaper than the other apps. | this web site is ridicules, I wanted to check a reservation, I had to re set my password. and still couldn't find the information. I'll never use Hotels again. | Easy to use, great app | easy to book rooms | best to find the best offert to stay | Great and easy-to-use | The language can't be changed to English? Why should I change the country to change the language to English, it just very frustrating and stupid way! | Freezes constantly - unresponsive. Authentication nightmare. | love to no how to cancel a booking never dell with you people again | The rest spot | good deals | They always hook me up with the best place, not to mention the best price! Stayed on Michigan Ave for a hundred bucks with tax, fees and resort fee! | I love the great customer service I have always gotten from hotels. | App will charge you in USD regardless of country you are in beware!!!!! | Slow to open | computer site needs work | The easiest way to book rooms anywhere! | I'm logged in and still have to verify that I'm a human every time I start the app | hard to find a record of booking | ease of booking affordable rooms in nice hotels. | easy and convenient | it works well. | Best hotel app I used for years. Thank You. | very difficult to get anything done | I think its a good app when in need of a QUICK hotel . But the hotels are a little pricey! No crash on my galaxy s2 | I can always find exactly what I want at a great price. | easy to use app with links to good prices with a wide range of price points. | Easy and quick to use | I can always get the best rates and the rewards are awesome. | Good üëç | Is this the world's most aggravating app? You are using your phone (which is the point of an app such as this) and it still presents a huge number of annoying 'Bot or not' tests. One or two might be acceptable; but a constant demand as it seemingly loads in the background is ridiculous. It stops you from finding new hotels or checking your account. I hope this is just a temporary glitch; but if not, then it really is completely useless. Why would you agrivate your users like this? | My go to hotels booking site!üëå | This app is hard to earn kick backs or rewards in. | Great Service, Great Prices | You won't get the best price, if I used the hotels own website it would have been about ¬£50 less for DBB, not happy! | really good straight forward way 2 book | The best app for your travel it is easy and rewarding. | super easy to book hotels just about anywhere. | Easy to use and great deals! | Easy to find and book hotels. | The App needs a lot of work, trying to sign in after creating a account is a joke, yeah sure it gives you a security code or sign in by password, however when you do sign in the gives you a capta which disappears and leaves you stuck in login mode and just sits there, you can't do anything at all, i am running a Google pixel 7a. | I was Totally AMAZD!!!! , with EXCITEMENT. I, GOT TO GO ""there. "" The I'm looking at hotels to travel around the world places I've never seen.! FOM THE FOOD'S available. The plates ful of color the Art too bust looking our waste line disappears .04/15/2024. | This app has so many glitches. The latest version makes me prove I'm not a robot, which doesn't seem to work very well, because it keeps saying the answers are wrong, even though they are clearly correct. And then when I do get in the search feature is not working for stays. In any city. Any county. Ugh. This is so frustrating. | easy-to-use | been using this app for 7 years now, definitely a money and headache saver. | Can't sign in. | Doesn't work in landscape screen orientation. Really annoying I have to use my tablet in portrait mode for this one app. | it's easy to use | fantastic booking app | Find good Hotels for a low price I would recommend it to everybody | brilliant prices | No longer allows me to log in (all log in buttons don't do anything) so currently is useless as an app. | easiest way to book a room with everything you need | It keeps on asking me to show my human side. I can't proceed to app even after completing the puzzle. Pls fix your app asap. I have trips coming up and I need my bookings. | very easy üëå | great | easy to reserve | Great Value for money every time | Always coming to a clutch and helping find a great place to stay. | Always use this app for my travels!!! | Never had an issue with the app. Never had an issue with a booking.

Update (04/24/2024): Their prices are exorbitant high, do check with hotels and flights directly on their site before booking with MMT. Once you have booked the tickets, cancellation is very cumbersome and difficult and you would most likely end up loosing all your money. | Nice no issues | Good | A user friendly app, and excellent for convenience of travel assistance. | I book 2 hotels in coorg and its nothing like how it was shown in the app. This is a scam.

But as of now it deserves at least 4 my only complaint is I wasn't able to call support when i had a question | Excellent | Tickets prices are amazing and not wasting time | My Travel Buddy & I are over 75 and Omio makes it so very easy for us to venture around a given country @ a low cost. | BlaBlaCar bus Cambi√≥ el itinerario y la aplicaci√≥n nunca me lo notific√≥, llegu√© a tiempo seg√∫n el horario de partida del tiquete en la app pero el bus ya hab√≠a partido ü§®üëéüèΩ | best app for booking bus, train tickets, also good airplane options | Great | Cut | Great site | Exquisite experience. Must have app for tour plan | Excellent üëç | It won't change my reservation, I had to cancel it and they didn't give me my money back, and I reserved another trip it took the money but didn't confirm reservation | Doesn't have basic routes. How does it not have westminster abbey as a destination | Update 9/4 now app sits on splashscreen and fails to load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, same prob. Absolute rubbish. | Always works well for finding my travel needs | Cheap, accurate, reliable and easy to use. Suggestion: if possible to allow booking of both hotel üõèÔ∏è+ flight ‚úàÔ∏è | Their insurance is outsourced to a third party (Xcover) which does not cover being delayed inbetween vehicles. Despite Omios website saying it covers delays. I.e. if your plane gets a 1 hour delay and you miss your bus, you get no refund by them. Misleading descriptions. Would not recommend. Also it's hardly worth paying premium for. | Easy! | Fantastic for travel in Italy from an Irish tourist | Excellentüëçüëç | Easy and accept jcb card | Great | Fabulous app saves me money on flights | The support is good. | Always takes the stress out of travelling | Worst experience ever, it comes at a higher price than any other platform, gives you a ticket with the message ""not valid""on it even though it charges you the full price and extra. I got a ticket from the trenitalia even though I bought a ticket from omio | Very good | good | Only app that let me book multiple train tickets across Europe in one go. Love it | Awesome work. Keep it up | Great app to plan your travel. | Okey | Very good | Very nice experience | Nice | Not worth the hassle of dealing with. I got screwed over multiple times in bookings buses through Omio. It's better to just book your ticket directly through the servicer. | It's basic. It just gives you the same information from your confirmation email when you purchase a ticket. I had a train cancelation from Germany to Netherlands and it didn't inform me or offer and details | Very pricese | Great way to check train schedules and book tickets | Easy to use, but not able to make changes to my train tickets | Great | Good quality | Download latest update and now I the option to make changes to my tickets disappeared. Options below ""Manage your booking"" doesn't work. | It is a very useful app. I used it for all my travel booking in uk. | Perfect services, no problems at all, I can't give less that 5* very happy customer | Great app to trains tickets | User friendly and mainly lowest price than other apps | So easy to use and great rail prices! | Easy to buy ticket butbthe damn app will not keep you updated on schedule changes | It looks good | Good | great | Great | Too good | Nice application | I love it. Just everybody else. The boring ones | Good | I thought I would have a better experience second time coming around but they gave me misinformation about my ticket. I was given the wrong platform when I arrive my station and I end up missing my train. Even then they won't refund you when it's their fault. | Nothing loads, all other apps work fine | Very useful for travelling | Good | Great | Good | Very helpful and easy to book all our trips. | Nice experience | Great üëç | Convenient | Nice | Good | Juste wonderful | Excellent try use this app | Very good | Nice | Great apps it helps a lot thank you | Bus was on time on outward and return journey. | Easy peasy for traveling Europe | I should have booked directly with sncf. the moment I had any issue with my ticket there's no one to talk to. I lost 480euros! small mistake that could have been fixed in place at the station could not be modified in the app and the omio support is a useless bot. don't risk it. | This app is easy to navigate with good customer support. | It is a good app for traveling | Quite efficient to find flights at good prices! | helps me a lot.. | Do not buy SNCF train tickets with this company, if the train is cancelled for any reason i.e. strike which is quite often they will not refund you! They wish you well & send you to SNCF for the refund. Omio's response proves my point, DO NOT BUY FROM OMIO SNCF TRAIN TICKETS!! | Does not give any different prices in relation to the general train and coach websites. If anything it works out more expensive as there are hidden charges due to changes and connections. Very misleading | So easy to use | easy to connect | Good | Awesome and easy to access | Omio does an excellent job. Finds good deals and many alternatives to some of the larger companies (fb) for instance. Highly recommendüòäüëç | Excellent | So quick and easy to use! | Worst service... train delayed for 35min... lost all other conections... Omio not responsible and not fixing a refund, pushing costumer service to treni italia. Treni italia impossible to deal with for a refund. Never again... thank you..! | No addresses and bus stations | Great service, app really easy to use | Great App! | Nice application | Awesome experience | I love it and it's smooth | Easy with everything in one place | Made my travel planning so easy | Thank u | I start my searches on Omio! | Great | Works good | Very informative and trustworthy | Good | Neat app to buy tickets. But they spam you with notifications. | The app has been so useful to plan my journeys. I love it | Easy to navigate! | downloaded this by mistake and found it works better than another | User friendly app with great discounts | Nice Nice | Good | So easy to use and so many options make it a pleasure to deal with | Good service | Very helpful as we plan out trip to Europe. | They have done a shameful thing. They cheated with their passengers. | love it use for all my trips perfect and always recommend it to others | Wonderful | üëçüëç | Very good application.. I recommend it. | Good","{""1"":13621,""2"":4006,""3"":2403,""4"":14422,""5"":114578}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,false,,"7.0","7.0","VARY","Omio","Omio","apps-feedback@omio.com","https://www.omio.com",,"https://www.omio.com/privacy-policy","Omio","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5Zkj-vrKHBauMF4srwktsFPPYQqTHA2Tlc8fZLPDyvgAEk2hhGfkNsKSnJZLNvIRHQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/f7nMQ4107_ufOzYdkaiFL9ZMWpt9DpeuJulZRZFiNFfO5aBssJVsLQpPJ7CQjuJJff8","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_-ZBNDAK983tUiK-vH0Q81DuFsr51X30MGzgLgWvXnL26SfdtgYEhcoFi3YTvX-meQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GSod9-dMDkU7kH_LbGZNMG3P8aI3AF1E9YA6Z-d5dzsGA6G3GNleLLnP9bXWGkwB8d4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tUOiqbUPYyLHw3W-klHCDrIoQb7kt0L48Lb6gI3RYufAKBU2RIEhcZR_LEPNTTCDaDN1"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V3uSB3Yib5hYay4GAElLDRSrwz7iKj6JgSmUbetI8CpkYpy24HkZvX8A_ZR3XNCS5vk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8JpG1o_ucp11xj-sUIv14McoNjnkxVaurQfYl7-BLAAyHDt9dNgPMKNlzp3cCFyGN4vY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qeykjqgLm8oFy-D5uCE1rj_vJuRJXKmmNQ4tC_VYau5gpYtIZbjqIBk8DL3eO0LfVQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GWs9wn0B1YxozpSJfKrWUVvLiGXwwOEYau86VBgqZHzAn9SxWVnBRqMtlAb1oKMKtg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/u0Yqyss-Zcm_SqNupVEYFJ9C_wnV5n0Zq7l3B8QAg3cZfGGefxzUrP7Lu6TV0SLk-Ww"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ysw33AJig7D3FX5Q5fgJNsXQ47867-rpe1CT8t2EmvfPbmJPUepTij06HiPtRj6iTEdR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QwREFkORUo8Cyo3qiV8HRZ_iGKK9EpMsL8a40z43N8jaDszfTRdE451Ha99eqCFofUY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3gPYK1T_UjPghimMlKy3687rDvG3i1XlUQgaGp_4oyV8roWhK353oESlgEh3w5Apie4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2HNMdWVGtMZbJDV6r_GFFZplsd878_ZvVwCQDf7Wi2BbtPzicAvEA2OkXG0OdIbPbV8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pEZJTrv-zF43-4iYhrPKR35YVdFNBBNhE_7RysccwtdNc2wgY4mEZYzMI6V2UZ_LRQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kR94PRzOhxqXfAdPFdvgWhiExwZa3O7IhP3eyIxAauY2ZxLyA3MAqhQ1MiOymls0i2U""]",,,,"PEGI 3",,false,"Jun 6, 2014",1713466476000,"9.15.0","Update your app to avoid being bugged by reduced speeds!

Easy to add personalized things. I have the paid version. | Excellent app, it does the job as expected. | I paid for this app but it wouldn't allow me to add items to the packing list. Every time I tried, the app crashed and closed. I was never able to make my packing list with this app and I forgot to pack a few things! I'm not happy. | Very essential | Very user-friendly | Great app for any type of checklist! | I really like it | Great idea. The app won't allow me to select just 1 clothing item... it's zero items or more than 2... I deleted the app. | Easy to use | It is nice for a basic, single city trip. However, there is no way to create a single packing list for a multiple city trip that could include one place cold and rainy and another that's warm and sunny. I wish I could type in multiple destinations with there dates and come up with a unified list. | Can't add to list, app just closes | Why does the past packing list go away?? Why not let us decide to keep it or not. Also no option to select between male / female | How to add counters for customised items to specify the count? | I wouldn't buy it again. Too buggy. If you update template it doesn't update the trip. If you update trip there is no way to update template. There is no search options. If doesn't recognize the place it just picks whatever the app want to choose. | Make packing easier | Crashed every time I added an item but still really cool if their last is perfect. It's auto generated after filling out some questions. Really cool. Never mind, I changed to 5 stars. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which resolved my issue. It works great now | Helped me think of things that I hadn't thought of. | A nice app to help you organize your packing before a trip. Love how you can customize to fit your needs. | This was a godsend as I was packing for my trip. Because of this app, nothing was forgotten that I had to go out and purchase. I also used it again for my trip back home, so I was sure I didn't forget anything there. In the end, I am confident this could potentially be labeled as a money saver! I love this app!! | Covers all necessities | This is my favorite packing app... It is perfect 10 /10. | It's a life (and luggage space) saver | Can only use for 1 location. Very disappointed | Must try | So helpful with all the travel we do. This app really helps ease my packing anxiety! | Super easy and complete! And fun to use. | It's legit. I always struggle at the last minute to remember everything but this generates a check list for you in seconds | This app is very helpful. Since I travel with my dog, I would like to have a way to remind me what to pack for him. Other than that, it's a great app. | Very Nice And Helpful for Travelers, Easy to use | I used to love this app but it's no longer reliable. Items keep disappearing off the list for not reason, then you end up forgetting things. | Easy to use... | It is very helpful when it comes to packing but some things may be annoying to other like the sound effects. Overall i belive this is a good app | The edit and delete buttons overlay the quantity button and are very glitchy | I do really like this app, but honestly I'm only doing the review as the constant 'rate the app' pop ups are really annoying me ü•≤üòÖ | Great app | So far so good! | Good app - best packing app I've been able to find. Please make it possible to rearrange the activities once they're in your list. ie. I prefer to have ""clothes"" at the top, then ""toiletries"" then ""electronics"" but it just places them in whatever order it wants. | Lack of support after purchasing the app. I had purchased this app on a different phone. When I installed it on a new phone the purchase didn't transfer. Tried contacting support several times without success. I switched to a different app. | Goood | Helpful app, haven't forgotten anything using this. | This app is definitely not as customisable as one would hope/expect in the paid version. | Great, easy to use app | Great app. Love it had location | Very thorough list | Easy to use. Very useful! | Really handy. Use for all trips. Just purcahsed the full version and custom lists are so useful. | Useful | Useless | Even after trying many times, adding stuff doesn't work. And when I delete things or mark them done, they come back! It's really annoying and makes using the app not uaeful at all. | Good covering all items | In App upgrade doesn't work. Money wasted. | It keeps deleting things I've added to my list. Maybe it's just me being a noobie. But the idea is not to forget anything. How can I do that if it deletes it without my knowledge. | An app that makes packing easy | Very cool | Very nice app | Used to love this app but now unusable due to bugs that prevent saving changes to templates. Only half the items added appear and some are randomly deleted from the template and from the trip packing list itself. | Easy to use Great prepopulated categories. Good price if you need to customize it | I've bought it but it doesn't work. When I add a new item on the list it shuts down. I would like to be refunded please. | Very helpful! | Very helpful I have a tendency to forget get all the stuff helps a lot | I really wanted to live this, even paid for the app. However, it does not save what new items I add to the list. ‚òπÔ∏è | Used to like it but a bug has made it unusable I was using this app often and found it very handy but recently I cannot add additional items to the lists because ever time I do the app crashes. This had made the app unusable for me which is disappointing. | Good guide for planning your trip | Kept removing things from my list on it's own | The free version at least is not customizable at all so it's kind of useless | Keeps crashing within a minute. Also lack of multi destination makes it very inefficient. I'll be asking for a reimbursement. | Superb | Very useful | Very useful for keeping track of what to pack | It has a lot of useful items and you can add your special items! Easy to use. | Great | Good app so far. | Easy to use, very thorough. | Good, does what it should even the free version | A good reminder | Very handy. Use it before every trip. Love that I can add custom items and change the order of the items in the pre-built lists (in the free version). I do wish I could change the order of the entire category lists. If I've chosen Working, it always appears as the first list even through I'd rather Essentials and Toiletries were first. | So helpful!!!! | Zero support! They never respond. Too bad. With a few improvements to editing as others have also asked for, this could be a nice 5 star app. | Helps you remember the little things. Used to pack things weeks before and list reminds you what you put in bag already | Nice app. Very helpful. Would be better if you could print the list. | Absolutely love this app. Easy to add new items (with premium) but only add them directly to the main list of you wish them to be temporary. If you want them to be permanent you can check on our off for present and future travel, scroll to the bottom to ""customize packing templates"" and add things there you permanently want on your packing lists. So smooth. I will use this app for years. Much better than my previous one and I love that you can customize for various types of travel. Perfect. ‚ò∫ | Best app for packing | Wonderful app. It helps you not forget anything when packing! | Essential for traveling | Limited editing options without upgrade. Items you add to the preset lists often disappear. | I love pack point I just wish I could add my own activites and customize my pack template ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Ready made lists for easy packing. No more oops, I forgot to pack... | Honestly this was just a waste of time. You have to buy premium just to add more dtuff as this is just ai generated. | Now they removed the swipe action so I can't remove the unnecessary items in the list, do I have to customise my list every time before the trip? That just don't make sense | Even after purchasing the app, no edits to the default lists will save. If you remove them to recreate them with your own items, the icons are not selectable (i.e. the toothbrush). There is no way to edit trip information if you make a mistake. Nor is there a way to edit a list item without deleting it and recreating it. | This is a wonderful app that helps me not forget things I need. I use it for every trip. | üôÇ | I like it very much | üëçgoodüëç | Please enable changing language in app | Good üëç | I don't understand why this app has so many high reviews. I made a list for an upcoming trip and immidiately started noticing issues such as; when it automatically added the items to my list at the starts I would delete them since I didn't need over half of them, later on I would try to add them back on but it wouldn't let me since I ""Already had them in that category"" but I had deleted them before. I aslo still haven't been able to have more than one list at a time and it's so frustrating. | Looks like a great packing list | Ver useful app and it allows you to add items to your list or swipe away items you won:t need. | Makes packing more efficient | I always use this when going on trips so I don't forget to bring anything, I check off what I pack and add to list anything else I need. I can also use it as a to do list for the day by just typing it in. | Enjoying the app so far. Great ideas for packing lists while also letting me customize to my needs. I wish I could edit the items in the list (vs deleting and adding a new item). I also wish there was an easier way to add items that may have been removed, without retyping them. But other than that, I have enjoyed the app. | Random list of things I didn't select is added to packing list when shared, but it's a semi useful reminder tool | I've always struggled with packing, and this app makes the process way simpler for me! | Great üòÉüëç | Everything ok, but I would suggest to add the option of having a different language from the system one. It is not possible to choose different languages. | Good app no complaints so far. Been using since 2021. | Nice travel package APP | Cruise Packing not available. | Easy to use | If activities don't include fishing then this app is useless. Not gonna spend money on premium version just to find out if it works. | GREAT APPS!!!! I just random to search on Playstore 'Packing List' and see I found this app. Thank you. | This app is quite helpful. It really helped me stay organised and made my packing easy. | Love PackPoint! | Awesome packing checklist | No horse riding options | Love it! | I just purchased the premium version so that I could customise the lists. I believed it would be easier to have the lists in clothes, shoes, electronics, plus the activities. It is not easy to use the app, there is no way to customise the lists, you cannot rename the lists. It is not very intuitive or user friendly. | Makes packing so much easier. I get packing paralysis...where I just sit and try to think of all the things I am going to forget. This app removes that and helps me pack quickly. | Amazing | I been using this app for years it is must have for any travel I love it so helpful | Missing many items. Unable to edit existing catalogue except for adding items (can't rename or move them). Paid for premium but it's just not worth it. Would like a refund | Great app to keep you organized when packing! | It's alright you just have to customize it a little. | I can't retrieve the packlist of my last travel !!!!! | I like the app a lot and am trying to upgrade to the premium option but it doesn't work. :( | I like it but it would be nice to sync it across devices | Just started using it, but I like what I'm seeing | It's a good app, but whenever I go to the purchase screen to upgrade it so I can get the full experience it freezes up. I don't know if this a Google issue or what. | Things disappear and other items never appear. Gotta try something else | Very nice, I use all the time! | This app does not have all requirements That's why I found a another app that's so cooolllll | this is exactly what i was looking for, just a simple packing app that wont clog up my notepad - the suggested items are helpful as well | OK list app. But basic things are missing such as link to buy premium or a help feature for how to customize or add new categories. App says I can customize but after much typing of a new category, app does not save. | So dissapointed in premium! Paid some money to have option to add new activities and create new list but it doesn't work! A ""+"" button is not active! Furthermore, I could not find any contact to write creators without commebting it here. | Great overall experience. The communication was good. They lay out the process, costs, etc, very well. The application process is straightforward. Underwriting and closing went well. They assign an account rep to help you through the process. I found them to be responsive and helpful. A decent balance of phone and email communication. This shared equity route is not for everyone but has value in certain circumstances. | Helps me to reduce my packing time. Works for all seasons and events . Saves me from forgetting items. Allows me to add items specific to my needs. | Not worth $3. No features. No multicity support. No sorting into bags. Could literally do better faster with an excel spreadsheet. | Easy to use | I like the preintalled packing list with the ability to customize and the weather averages. | Love that this is a 'to do' list just for traveling... | Really helpful for a busy mind traveller. | Easy to use. | Helpful. Some items are outdated but I like it as a packing guide. | I hate packing, this is brilliant and makes it so much easier. It even tells you the weather of where you'll be going. | Easy to use | overall great app, items preset and can add your own to tailormake it! would like options to edit and delete items. | Great app | Loving it so far. | Great app | Best app | Good and useful application.simple UI is easy to use for almost every age group. | I wish there was an area to make a shopping list of items needed from the suggested list. | Very helpful app. | Has everything I need | Easy to use and great lists | I have used this app for a long time now. Detailed packing lists while not being overly complicated! Great app. | You will never forget anything again. | I have used this app for years. I have recently found a new app that I like much better. My complaint with Packpoint is that you can't edit your lists. None of the items can be changed without deleting everything. Even then, you can't edit the pre-suggested items to make the list your own nor can you edit any item you have entered. I will unfortunately be moving on to the new app which I can customize as needed. Thank you, Packpoint, for your past service. It's PackTeo for me now! | Great for camping. I can customize different item lists to have presets I can choose depending on the location. Love that it estimates the weather too. | Amazing so helpful I love this app I travel a ton and it's so great | Good | Great app! | This app is great. | Great app | It generates a basic list, easy to edit that list. Helps my mom brain to remember everything! Practical and helpful. | Is really cool I don't have to do my list on paper anymore and I'm able to see even things or stuff that I have to add that I never think about it | Great auto generated lists | User friendly. | It reminded me of essential items to pack. Thank you! | Sucks paid for the deluxe version and it doesn't work. Waste of $2.99 | Super useful for planning trips | Have been using this app for years! Very helpful. | Does the job really well; I always pack in less than 30 mins even for weeks long trips. But could use a total UX and UI overhaul. | great so far only just downloaded | Your app is missing option to have activities for Spiritual trips visiting temples or sacred places | Great app, love the interface. Well done. üëèüëèüëè | Packing list I got was full of useless things. I'll make my own list. | Good but they need more options for activities you would be doing on a trip | Good | Always to the point on information needed. | Works great and keeps me organized | Just downloaded it a few days ago and paid for the premium features, mostly for the widget and presto chango, the widget is gone. I uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache and data. Just poof gone. | Super helpful | Not saving the new items added all of a sudden! | Don't know where this app has been all my life. I can see areas for improvement but it is on the right track. | Very useful for Travelling | Love how you can add different items and check them off as you pack | Does exactly what I needed, clean and easy to use | Would like to create a list for other members of my family, in addition to mine. | Really awesome recommendations on here, very organized and easy to use. | GOOD: Tripit integration, cool UI. BAD: 1.Can't edit template items' names. Spelling mistake? Delete-then-re-entry. 2.Can't reorder list items so again have to delete-then-add in preferred order (grrr). Need most important stuff high in list (insulin) less important lower in list (drink bottle) 3. New phone, lose all your templates (grrrrr, what did I have on essentials again). Should backup & restore from Google drive. 4. Beta program does no new features, just minor fixes | Only did free version but worked well except that you can't seem to delete things completely so if you misspell something you are still left with 3 versions of it | This app make my all trip easy | Travel has always stressed me out for two reasons- 1. What time to leave for the airport and 2. What to pack. This app has made packing a breeze and stress-free. I upgraded to the paid plan and it was well worth it. I also use TripIt and it connects to that app which is really convenient. When I used it for the first time it knew that it was for a trip to Barcelona. It reminded me of the weather and how many days that I would be gone. Pretty cool! | Helps this absent-minded guy remember what he needs. | Easy to use","{""1"":1500,""2"":1072,""3"":1500,""4"":7504,""5"":27873}",0,,,true,"CZK","Free",true,true,"CZK¬†89.99 if billed through Play","5.0","5.0","VARY","Wawwo","Wawwo","info@packpnt.com","https://www.packpnt.com","8605 Santa Monica Blvd
