You can create and collaborate your entire trip using their mobile apps and the web app. I used the pro option to export everything to Google Maps which was really useful for planning days out. | i like ability to manage my own created itinerary. would like to see ability to search for restaurants and make reservations through the app. | it's a great app for those who love to travel | Such a great planner for our holiday! Loved the option to personalise costs for particular places. Not sure the pro version was worth it, the free option was pretty solid on its own. I would have liked pop-up reminders for events, but it was easy to get up to speed. A little slow at times. | I started using Wanderlog in 2023 to plan my Tokyo trip. From then on, I have not used any other trip planners. Wanderlog is easy to use and I like it that there are many fun recommended sights/places for the countries I travel to. I also love the Optimize Route feature as it helps me plan the itinerary more efficiently. In addition, the Customer Support was very prompt in answering my questions. Overall a great travel app! | Haven't used it for long but so far I am in love with the app, it has made it easier for my family to plan our trip and be able to all add things we would like to do and then organize everything | Free app optional to pay for extra service, easy to re-arrange the location with diff date, also can access it in web page too, happy with this app! | I am very pleased with the application. It serves my purpose well. I appreciate having everything in one convenient location. I can easily mark places I want to visit and view them on a map. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly. This application is an excellent tool for planning vacations. I have used it for my second vacation and will undoubtedly continue to use it in the future. | Would recommend! Very smart and convenient for planning the trip ahead | This app was great, allowed me to have all my travel plans in one place, very easy to use! | I love this app! Stay organized in one place! I used to use MS Word for all of the details but I love how Wanderlog automatically provides links and other info about all the places I have on my itinerary. I also like that I can make my own categories for other information. I'm using this app for four trips I'm in the process of planning and it's great. It's helpful for small trips of a couple days and two week long trips. | great tool for planning. organize evrerything in one place. Very flexible. easy to plan a road trip with many different stops. amazing amount of resources. | Well organized, easy to send info from my email confirmations, also updated expenses if included from reservations. Some interesting recommendations, easy to add places of interest to itinerary. Could be better in providing directions with options. | absolutely indispensable for trip planning! | Meh... Useless app with prev pay | Very useful to manage trips activities | Very convinient for planning a trip. It's quite laggy sometimes. Hope it will get better in the future. | easily captured all my trip details in one place! I could even refer back to the content that I forwarded if I had any doubts. | One the greatest tools ever for planning a trip. Ive used it on my 26 days trip to Japan and no other tool has been so usefull for planning and keep diary of all places we visit and wanted to visit! Its also incredibly easy to add things to your own planner from other peoples planners to easily build up your own Wanderlog 😉 | The perfect app for planning and organizing trips. | This app seems really cool but upon initial download, the amount of pop ups that show and redirects that the app does are incredibly distracting. I'll update the review as I use the app more however. | The idea is cool but the execution is poor. The loading time is long even though I have a pro account and offline access. In a good app this should mean loading and updating in background, but here is have to sit through seconds of loading on a high speed connection. Can't add regular transportation modes such as ferries to the planner. The auto-importer misses a lot and if you turn on Gmail auto-search it duplicates a lot. There are better products out there. | Great way to collect all your ideas for your trip then arrange them day by day. I really enjoy the map function to easily see where all your chosen attractions are located. | Useful app but lags a lot (I haven't seen this much lag in any other app) | A really useful app with a lot of options. Sadly it is pretty laggy on mobile and small things like swapping items on the itinerary from one day to another are error prone. The view on mobile can also get too cluttered, especially if you plan long trips with multiple stops. Also, it's sad that you can only purchase a yearly subscription to get premium features. Monthly subscriptions make way more sense for this type of app | great resource for planning | very helpful in planning a trip to a new place. It helps map your itinerary and shows many little things that help you complete your trip without thinking you missed something special. | I searched for a free app. This is not free. | I just found THE app for travelling! Amazing one-stop platform to put everything together, from flight details to lodging to places of interest... BONUS stuff: able to create notes, share with co-creaters, best routes, recommended places to go for dine and play... Thank you Wanderlog team for creating this awesome app! 😁 | The premise of the app is great and it has a lot of great features, but lately it has been extremely glitchy, for example the ""add"" button for new places to visit doesn't work for some sites no matter how much I press it, also the loading time is really frustrating. Today I made a new travel plan and painstakingly added more than 30 places to visit, only to find a few minutes later that the trip was nowhere to be found on my account :(( | I started planning a two week international trip with this app, so easy and intuitive. I love it and have recommended to friends who travel | awesome | This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used. it's just so well thought out. I am putting this at the top of the list of my favourite app. The web app is even better! | Really helpful to have all your travel information in one place! The explore page is great for inspiration and ideas. The interface can look a bit cluttered but once you familiarise yourself with it, it's really simple to use | I really love how this app organizes all your details. Especially love the feature where you email your reservations, and it plugs it into your iteniary! I attached screenshot of park passes, entered addresses, and it offers up other places to go and see. With a family of 7, I have to stay on top of every detail and reservation: Wanderlog makes that so easy! | I love this app! It's so easy to use, all your trip details in one place, easy to edit & manage agendas. It also opens the door to experiences you may have missed or overlooked by showing other points of interest, restaurants & experiences. I think they have covered everything you want to keep track of, all in one place! | excellent travel planner app | I stumbled on wanderlog a while ago and saw an amazing opportunity to use it for my trip to Korea. It was really easy to use, the interface was good. For me the best feature is the ability to have a map that shows the distance from one place to another. All in all I will definitely use this app again. So amazingly easy to plan for a trip. | Good idea and app but you will get tons of ""ads"" for hotel etc. But the Pro price is exactly what's wrong with todays subscription model. It's a travel app and the only option is to pay for a whole year, and it cost almost €60 (!). I also get a more expensive price in the app when i'm logged in than what their website say (€50). €60/year for Pro that most people will use for offline mode and attachments is crazy. Better to pay for e-sim. | La mejor aplicación para planificar viajes nacionales e internacionales. | I used the free version to plan my upcoming 1 month solo trip for Europe. Is a very good app which help me plan my itinerary easily and handy!! I even introduce my sister to use this app and she love it. | This app is not free, it is $50 per year after they collect data. I don't mind paying for an app, but don't lie. | awesome app! just what I was looking to plan our trips. full feature and very easy to use. | I have been the designated trip planner for our friend group for almost 10 years now. I have used apps like Tripit, Google Travel, splitwise, Citymapper, you name it! Once I found Wanderlog, I deleted all other apps. Wanderlog is all these apps combined into one!! And it's virtually glitch free. We recently took a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. Planning and executing has been a breeze. The developers have thought about every possible scenario. Budget summary could use some fine tuning. | Amazing app with all the features I need for planning trips. I shared with my family, friends, and today with coworkers. Looking forward to improvements as this app progresses. | absolutely love this app, I use it to keep track of places and things I want to see and also use it to log my trip as a trav journal! | Nica app. But it has many functionalities missing from the free version . | Fabulous app that has been so valuable in coordinating our trip. Everything you need is right here! AAA+ | Great tool to help plan and navigate our trips | Good functionality but I find the constant 'helpful' popup tips very grating. I think they are a good idea but the fact that it forcibly changes what's displayed on the screen and drags you away from what you were trying to do is too intrusive and instead of reading then I've just been clicking them away - hopefully I'm almost through them all now. Also maybe a personal preference but I find the text and interface a bit too zoomed in/not dense enough, maybe there could be a setting for this? | Great app for travel planning. Has the ability to add places, notes, etc. A great all round travel app | LOVE being able to share the trip itinerary with others. LOVE being able to easily re-arrange the things I've selected to do. LOVE multiple sources to find best of the best w regard to dining, etc., Can't wait to try it LIVE!! | this is a great system and can even quickly start navigation in rental cars. | really like this app. helped with planning | Excellent app, has made it possible for me to plan complex trips overseas and keep organized | I organised my Kyoto trip with the help of Wanderlog. I had an amazing good time. Now I am planning my next trip in July. Thank u Wanderlog. | I moved to Wanderlog from TripIt because of the clean, modern interface of the application and the website. I also like the map feature where it plotted on the map all you lodgings. Customer service was responsive and fast. Overall this great apps helped me on my 5 weeks trip to South America with many flights, hotels, car rentals and activities.AI integration looks promising as well. | Really good app very helpful to be notified when places will be closed | I love this app! It made trip planning so much easier to have everything in one spot, and so intuitively. Very user friendly and helped by allowing me to research options and have them pulled up in advance | Great Planning Tool | User unfriendly. Can't search within trip. Useless. If I could give less stars, I would. | this app has been amazing for planning my trips. absolute life saver so easy to use | Just used Wanderlog to plan my vacation and it was fantastic! Highly recommend giving it a try. | Amazing tool to plan and organize your trip. Saves a ton of time. There's a lot of room for improvement, but what they've got is worth 5 stars for how useful it's been. | Very good for travel planning. Easy to use. | I love the ability to organize to the level available even in the free version. Looking forward to what features and functionality are available in the paid version. | Powerful organizer for travel plans. | After much researching, I decided to give Wanderlog a go and it was pretty neat. A lot of things can be synced by forwarding hotel and flight emails, adding the cost of individual places / activities / food, adding links etc. The itinerary makes the trip easy to navigate, way better than Spreadsheet 🤭 So, thanks Peter Xu! For creating this wonderful app. I've started using for my next trip with my girlfriends :) | Very good apps for travel. My whole trips is plan well because got the Wonderlog, very helpful. | Great travel planning app with new features added regularly. | brilliant, everything is in one place, I love it | I have used Wonderlog for many of my trips. | The app keeps crashing on some places of the map view. I thought it was depending on the number of places I had added but then I realized this was not the cause. I also found quite annoying to add notes in the Itinerary view. Considering this is a touristic app, you should add other payment ways to buy the subscription as I tried to do it from the Google Play Store and because their country limitations I wasn't able to do it. | Too many pop ups, even after disabling tips. Would be nice to have a calendar view of itinerary as well as a download to excel or pdf function. | so far, to help on planning it has been helpful. it aggregates the info from my mails | a great app to consolidate travel details into a single itinerary. It's especially handy when you use multiple platforms to book flights, accommodation, tours and train/car travel as it's easy to check that booking dates are correct. | Not for me too nosy and seems to want to take over I installed Thanks | good and nice | I've only used it for a few days, but so far everything works great! It's great to be able to gather all the details of a trip in one place instead of searching email and texts and saved documents. | Great features | I love this app! I'm that person who is the planner of the group and always has a Google Sheet. I LOVE the organization/the mapping functionality of this app & the ability to have different ""layers"" of the map so I can see locations for different days or purposes (a map showing me everything I want to do! or a map showing me all the restaurants I'm considering! So helpful). Also love emailing the app to auto populate hotel reservations and train/flight reservations onto the itinerary!! | While not perfect, this is the best travel app I've tried so far. Great way to organize my itinerary, get directions, see suggested stops, and more. I'll keep using it! | Best travel planning app ever. | Very good App. Useful when you want for city break's with many things to, like Paris | love this app, planning a trip to Hawaii, this was a great help to keep track of everyone's tickets and itinerary. Bravo! | Extremely helpful. It's now one of my favorite apps. We just got back from a four day weekend, and it was fantastic to have all the information in one place. No more searching through email and texts to find information about your next stop. Directions are ready with just one click. We are planning a longer vacation in August. As I make reservations or book flights, I just forward the email to the app. The info will be right there when I need it. Great for detailed planners and for casual trips. | Would've been a great travel planning app, but I had lists just disappear without any explanation and have to remake them again. Will reach out if it happens again. | UPDATE: Plus one star for responding and at least attempting to fix the issue. Pro version still very expensive and a poor value, especially when their system burps at inconvenient times. Garbage app. Made the mistake of purchasing Pro. It won't automatically add vrbo's or other similar bookings and won't let you forward emails or enter bookings manually either. TripIt here I come. | wonderful tool, forever evolving, like travel itself, to make it easier, more intuitive and indespensible. | UNINSTALLING - Was given the impression that this app was free compared to competitor apps that are ""overpriced annual subscriptions"". This also has an annual subscription price, which is required in order to do anything in the app beyond the 7 day trial. $70 for an app to plan a budget friendly road trip... talk about ironic. | AI is fairly accurate and the recommendations are legit. I hope to see more exclusive deals to justify the subscription. | Best App for Traveling | organizing my trip in a couple of weeks and I'm already in love. THIS is exactly what I needed to sort out distance, opening hours and other things that would stress me out if I didn't have the details all laid out in a concise, neat way. | Offline access behind a paywall? LOL. Thats a new one. That means there's no acceptable free version as many trips you can end up with poor or no connectivity. | Really difficult to separate free from paid pro app. There is no activities/tour tab in this app, which makes it useless for me. The graphics are beautiful. I like the way it pulls in suggested activities and shows the map but without an activities... | This is a great app for travel planning. I found several spots I would have missed and I loved being able to plan out our days with travel time estimates to avoid packing to much in to a single day. | incredible product. what would take me several sites to research and plan can now be done on one site lots of features and simple to use | Excellent! It's the most complete and intuitive app available. 100x better than spreadsheets, helps you to keep track of expenses, and also suggests attractions you should go to during your trip. I love it! | Stuff of nightmare. Pop ups everywhere. So many screens, sections, buttons, navigation, suggestions, recommendations, automation. OMG cannot understand a bit. Started with paid version. Then immediately uninstalled, phew.

All reservations pertaining to a trip in one place. | Couldn't create an account. It said the password I was entering to create a brand new account didn't match their records. Password requirements were vague as well. | i love it better with upgrade this time as the tickets and hotels, and activities automatically links with Trip It app. very handy | Helpful and easy to use by review of reservation and booking mails. Personalization of design could be improved | so far so good | I dont see any benefit to pro. It seems a lot to pay just for flight notifications. We already get that from the airline. I would like to be able to add more than 3 photos/pdf so that everything is in one place. It's a little archaic not to. Also, it's a trip planner, add a packing list. Again, so it's all in one place. This is my 1st time using this app and I'm travelling in 11 days. I'll edit when I return! | ""Error: saving failed. Please try again"". CONSTANTLY. Duplicating plans to different trips changes the trips' dates automatically, even after editing the duplicated plan to reflect new dates. Mass-editing still not possible after a decade plus. Amateurish effort and a childish attempt by intuit to hoover data. | Paid for the Pro which has some benefits like adding travel documents and updated gate alerts, but whenever my airline sends me updated flight times (which seems to be frequent) , it adds the updated flight as a new flight and then I don't know which leg of each trip is the new or old and I have to delete the whole trip and start new. Very frustrating. Updated to add it used to be better at forwarding emails and automatically inputting information. Half the time they go to unfiled documents now | Great way to organize a trip with multiple people planning, numerous hotels and stops, and flying more than one airline. | great app for planning | If you travel for business or pleasure, this would be a very useful addition. It take organizing to a new level. | soooo handy, highly recommended | Excellent travel companion. The stuff you need, in a simple presentation, and that's it. | fab app to get all your travel plans organised and in one place | Awesome | Perfect for long trips, especially when a lot can change 🙂. | A great place to hold all the details of your trip. | I've been using this app for 13 years and I find it to be one of the most useful apps on my phone. I'm planning another trip and Tripit correctly and safely stores my itinerary. Love it. | Super helpful and easy to use. Everything in one place, straight from your mails, no need to do much. | so easy to use and a great, clear itinerary display | very good tool to manage trips and hwt regular updates | trip it keep all the travel and hotels together. Very practical. | Tripit Pro is the best way to get organized and then stay dynamically organized as your trip progresses. | I have used TripIt for multiple trips, and I appreciate how it keeps us on track with our schedule. I also like that I can share the itenary with others. I would, however, like to see both a start and end time on the main page. | it's a great traveling tool. | Fun to track it all. | Doesn't connect to email like it used to. Harder to use. Used to so smooth and seemless, not anymore. | I love having all of my reservations in one place with addresses, reservation numbers, contact info and anything I could need while traveling. I can also share the itinerary with people that are traveling with me. | Have used and loved it for years. In 2024 the airport maps no longer display but give an error message saying there is a bug. Very inconvenient. Deducted a star. | great app!!! very useful to organize your trip!!!!! | For hotels during the trip, the timeline view only shows the start and end day of the accommodation. We need to show our colleagues ""where to stay"" each day after a busy day full of events. This was requested since 2016 and still not considered in a so called ""trip planner"" app. Any project planner like MS planner, Trello can easily duplicate the element and distribute them on each day as a column. Optionally, a packing list should be made available as a trip planner | Very useful information in one place. | great app | Useless, unless you pay for a subscription | Does the basics and allows to better organize a trip for easier visualisation, but could use some improvements. - Interface is OK but not great. It can be a bit confusing to use at first. - Does not allow to share trips with friends for reasons unclear that even support can't say. - I considered the pro version but I can't really understand what the benefits are apart from flight notifications, which I already get with my airline app for free. | Excellent app | Won't sync with outlook | Great, except the incorrect time display | Unable to create account. Keep getting ""use a strong password"" message when my password is 14 characters long with upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Frustrating. | Love how it organises everything for you. | I use Tripit for ongoing and complex trips lasting 6 months and more. It is a really good tool for identifying errors in my booking process. | it keeps surprising with features that pop up that I really appreciate | loving the simplicity and organization | so helpful | Can't connect to travel partners. Entering account information for car rental accounts, hotel accounts, and airline miles accounts is useless. TripIt doesn't effectively sync with any of them to pull current rewards information. | only with limited photos to upload | Really great way to keep all dates and bookings in one place and to share with multiple group members. | This app is awesome! It keeps all of my itinerary in one place. It even gives a safety score for where you're staying. Perfect job | Regularly logs you out and hangs when doing offline syncing so had to uninstall it as of March 2024 | Where has this been all my life??? | just downloaded. just what I was looking for | Invaluable tool for any traveler. | wowwwww, its a powerful tool 😎 | The app will not let me sign in. It's tells me my password isn't valid. But I can log in on a browser with that password so clearly it is the right password. This is insane. | I have been using for years. very convenient to have your flights, hotels, trips etc all in one place. | The best travel management app I've ever used had only one issue (processing non English bookings). Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred... What if this happened during trip? Useless app.... Uninstalled... Resolved previous issues. Apparently my device was updating apps at the time and a glitch occurred when I tried to log in to TripIt. After updates completed, I was able to change my password and update my trip information. Apologies to team TripIt. | Amazing app | I love how it creates your trip schedule so easily! | easy to organize complete trips | Great app to plan your trip. Gets updated from your email confirmations automatically so you have all your trip info in one place | Love how helpful status updates are! Best travel planner! | will let know once | great way to keep all of your travel information in one place. | awesome travel organizer | I think this is a scam it asks you for your date of birth and where U live straight away and it barely made any plans for me I had to do it myself and you have too pay $80 a year | I really love having this app. It helped me plan my recent trip to Canada. I haven't had to pay anything to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential.

Hopefully, they will fix it | I use this app ALL THE TIME! I love it! It helps me explore places, find the best things to do, places to stay and good eats. I can make reservations through the app and message the venues to make sure things are still available. It's user-friendly and I can make decisions based on reviews. It saves time and money when you're in new places. Don't leave home without it. | Pretty good but missing features... Can't rate individual food atmosphere service like you can on the website and also I haven't been able to figure out how to add specific caption to the photos uploaded. | Food is always great, ambience perfect, good venue for private functions. Located at heart of Westland, Nairobi. Nice terrace view... | Just garbage! Tried to search for things to do in Vegas, app literally closed; twice! I cleared cache, and it did it a third time. | Good app for information | Love the app. Going places is now less of a gamble, and you get the opportunity to say a ""well done"", when a place earned it, and to give your feedback to a place when they could improve. I'm sure some businesses will have benefitted greatly from the app. | Use it a lot, especially for restaurants | Amazing | Must have per I viaggiatori | Easy to use and great for information | Excellent as a reference for your trip. | The app is to specific in the end questions and not flexible enough in reviews | Am happy | Love trip advisor. Still loving the app 6 years after I posted the first review. | Good | When we do good things, our life will be more better | Good well been | Used to be good but now negative reviews are allowed to be deleted by the owner so you get to many positive reviews | Good experience | Great to use and good to refer to when deciding on whether one should use a certain service | I have used and love TripAdvisor for many years. One of the best websites to use when traveling!!! | September 12 2023...unstable...cuts out when scrolling | Very good | I never go anywhere new without consulting TripAdvisor | Easy to use and navigate | I love travel | Great for viewing places you are interested in or finding new places to explore | Good App | So easy to complete a review and upload photos | Updated the app. Really wish I hadn't. My Trips have been ruined. I was quite happy planning my trips by days. Who the hell knows what day e.g 18th June is without looking at a calender! | Everything great so far, I may increase rating as as king within the first 5 minutes of opening the app doesn't allow for much user experience | Easy to complete. | Does everything it should and also well. I also enjoy the layout and never had any problems | Wonderful hotel | Lots of options. Details of tours, locations, attractions.

Enjoyed very much | Good. More filters would make it great. | Good location. Extremely clean and comfortable hotel and rooms. Excellent breakfast. | Very helpful in finding fun things to do | Very helpful and good for advice | Good | Great app | Nic | TripAdvisor is my trusted go-to app when traveling or planning travel. The customer reviews of restaurants and activities are a trusted resource. | I've discovered it's freezes at different places. Sometimes using the A.I, Sometimes not. Doing regular searching | I do not know how I managed before I started using TripAdvisor | This app is so good | The app refuses to go online. Despite every other app working and my internet being fine. Have tried reinstalling it a bunch of times and this has been a problem for months. | Excellent and easy to use. | Why is all the prices coming up pound instead of us dollars. Everything looks interesting but I can't book cause I don't know the correct price | The app is intuitive and easy to navigate. Finding reviews, recommendations, and nearby attractions was a breeze | Decent app. Works ok but a bit clunky | Here you can find what you need Very useful site | I just uploaded some photos and they were initially tiny and subsequently 90 degrees rotated!? | Keeps crashing. On a Huawei mate 20 pro | It was a really good experience using tripadvisor. It was really helpful. It is an app which is worth recommendation 😀 | Such an amazing app , it really helped me for my trip with my family.

Just go for it | App keeps crashing. Useless | Great app. Bad update. Where is the Map View??? Shoulb be right on the home page.. | Great app. I am using this app from long time. Highly recommended. | A helpful App to find restaurant destinations | Very good and Imformative | Interesting reviews | Great platform for review | I used to use tripadvisor to plan my trip exclusively. But the update in Dec ruined the whole experience. First, the map next to itinerary on the desktop version is too small to be useful. Secondly, trip planning function becomes too painful to use because there is no way to tell which saves have or have not been added to a itierary. Third, why they never build a simple tab that could archive old trips or sort trips alphabetically. | Very best app | The Trip Advisor app works consistently well and is great app experience!The Trip Advisor app is fun to use,is very helpful!Trip Advisor always works like it should! It's always a pleasure to suggest,advise and share information with others that would be helpful.They post info quickly to help others make good,educated choices!The pictures posted always look crisp!

Look no further. I am impressed with the information it contains within the app. All in one app for travel planning. | Es la Mejor app para viajes, lo tiene absolutamente todo! | Update: The suggestions I put forward are now in place, and for me the missing piece of a complicated trip involving multiple forms of transport, accomadation and activities all in one place and easy to access, thankyou So far all been great, messaged them with a question/suggestion and they have been very open to this which is always helpful | The app is great, it allows any kind of macro- or microplanning for a trip. Fits my usecase perfectly. I have one gripe though: train transports in Japan seem to not calculate routes correctly - a train connection is simply shown as a straight line from A to B. I don't much care for which exct connection I end up taking, but I'd like a rough route shown just as with car trips. | I had an issue where my trips ""disappeared"". I contacted support through the app, they put me onto a tech specialist who dug through the obstacles and fixed the problem much faster than I could have reasonably expected. Great service. | I think it's the best trip planner in store. Please add support to Japanese and Chinese language. The app tends to change the place name from local language to English to display. | I added 14 flights to my trip, updated the destination and everything deleted. If you do not pay for premium and you lose internet acess while travelling, the app will not let you access any information you stored. And you obviously cannot upgrade without internet. This app became useless when I needed the info most. | Very complete, very useful to gather all the trip details in one place. Missing features to me: one calendar view, in addition to the existing agenda view. And a detailed resume of the whole trip (in the app, not as pdf) | Keeps freezing for me and a friend's phone. Unusable. | the best trip planner, and TOTALLY WORTH IT | Extremely buggy don't recommend | Sadly not great. It's really clunky and not user friendly. I tried to add our Airbnb and I could only add the address and then I still had to search for it and the programm couldn't find it so it was only added as waypoint. When you search for ""museum"" it searches for it in other countries and when you Klick on the map you can not view what a point is a put you just get asked to add it directly. I have tried to make it work but I found it completely unusable | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | excellent app for tracking your journeys | Love it. Easy to use and makes planning a trip so much better | Awesome app, my only complaint is that I wish there was a tab for hotels or AirBnbs like the tab for transportations. EDIT: I mean a tab just for hotels to put the bookings numbers.. a special marker on the map.. etc just like the transportation tab. | Out of all travel planning apps we found this one to be the best. It shows you distance between locations, has good suggestions in-app and you can easily add activites day by day. I liked that at all times you can see what your trip looks like on map, to get a good sense of distances and make best decision for your trip. Gladly purchased the pro version for our next trip. | Great App for planning tours | Still a work in progress, but the development team is remarkably responsive. This is certainly slated to become the staple travel planning software. | Can't even get started because the app refuses to let me do anything because my start location is ""behind"" my destination, whatever that's supposed to mean. | I can't deselect notifications in app, have to go via phone settings to not get daily reminders that I've created trips. I know that, really annoying. Distance between stops is measured in straight lines, not following the roads (extremely useless). It's anything but intuitive to create a roadtrip yourself, I will take some more time again on the weekend but will probably delete the app again. | 10/10 app Also to mention the developer is super nice !! | Love this so much I'm excited to use this app for my friends holiday it is so helpful and I bought the Pro so I can't get checklists and it's perfect I have everything I need all in one spot | Pity not available offline on the free version....otherwise great app | I have submitted negative review earlier due to lots of bugs with pro version, which has been resolved lately. Good customers support and very useful app to plan and organise a trip, either shared or individuals. | It doesn't take you to your destination via roads, it just shows how you can get there as the crow flies. Not very useful considering the activities and attractions I would want to add wouldn't be along a route of this type. Super confused about how people find this app useful. I must be missing something but I feel like I've tapped every button at this point and it just keeps wanting me to travel in a straight line. | super | Overall the app is great but it would be more if I can view all my trips at one page rather then switching between cards. Also there are no option to group or classify the trips between Visited and Want to Visit. | -Nice pix for places (POIs) -Nice suggested places! -No ability to add line for dep/arr times, unless w Notes. Only has date in small font for itin. item; also want big font date above. -Transport. options are many w own icon; but section icon is airplane. -Itin. building too focused on waypoints vs POIs. Wish could toggle to enter POIs only, for specific item rather than selecting item from list and whether waypoint or POi (can add either w list or from map). -""reviews"" at bottom; don't need. | I love this app! It's definitely my favorite travel app so far. But I have a few suggestions. A way to add a hotel other than a location- like something with a different color code (maybe purple) that shows up below the location and above the other things planned in the itinerary. Another thing I'd look for would be a way to add excursions!! They could show up with the ""nearby places"" and you could enter a name, company, location, time, etc that allows you to see everything you have planned. | As a travel app, I find it pretty bad. There is a date interval for a waypoint, but no hour interval, only a fixed hour. How to plan a day's activities in the same city, then? Can't have itineraries and distances between locations within the same city, so useless on the ground. Itinerary doesn't display any of the addresses, have to click for address, then back. Click, back. So unwieldy and frustrating. How did it get such high scored reviews? I don't know. | I tried using this app, but it is not functioning as it should. I added a couple of connections between way points, but when adding a third connection, the previous two disappeared. I found myself entering the same information multiple times in order to adjust my itinerary and I finally gave up, because it's just not practical and you can't edit items effectively. I also wasn't able to add my traveling documents from storage. The screen just froze. | This app is nifty and helpful, but it could be much better. If you make a timeline and decide you want to add something in the middle you basically have to start over. Also since I decided to go ahead and try for the ""pro"" version it keeps crashing and takes a long time to load. | This app is amazing! I tried 10 different apps and this was the best one. It is also the only one that can help you if you have not totally decided where you want to go. They have a very impressive selection of recommended tour locations to help you decide. But if you already know, they can also help you plan a great itinerary with places to see, and have tons of features. And I especially impressed when I found a small glitch. I reached out to them (they are very friendly) and they fixed it 😃 | This is a great app so far! My issue with it is the map itself. I am located in the U.S. where distance is measured in miles. The issue that I'm having is the map within Lambus and Google Maps are not matching up. For example, Google Maps estimates my travel distance to be 802 miles whereas Lambus estimates the distance to be 730 miles. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but it's preventing me from having an accurate itinerary. Keep up the great work (: | НАКОНЕЦ-ТО! удобное приложение для планирования маршрута, с накидыванием точек, фоточками, доками и проч! структура внутри приложения оч ложится на моё видение как надо планировать - сначала намечаешь какую-то относительно большую зону (город), куда поедешь, а потом накидываешь точек, что в этой зоне интересного есть посмотреть! и нет всяких проплаченных отелей и проч рекламы! | I was beginning to like the app; however I found a lot of discrepancies between the built-in map and the Google map which is really confusing. Further I can't locate some places I want in the map :( Ability to add a hyperlink in the notes section would be great! | excellent! app best app to create trips with friends ! | Nice with almost everything in one place. However, while adding the expenses I am forced to select one of the existing categories and cannot write my own. For example, I eat at a restaurant and spend 26€ then I must select restaurant as a category rather than being able to write the name of the restaurant (no customization). I opted for other apps in this situation. | Peace of ... | The collaborative approach to trip planning is what I was missing from features like Google Trips, so I'm was very excited to find this app! The design is very clean and sleek. I wish that there was a way to organize Waypoints based on destination (ex: attractions vs food vs shopping, etc.) to more easily distinguish areas on the map at a glance. | Absolutely love it | Awesome App | Superb app! Highly recommend for travel planning and expenses calculation. | I have been looking for an app like this for ages, I love to travel and this is a great way of keeping track of places I want to visit. The map view make it really easy to navigate and helps me plan an itinerary. The app easy to use and you can input lots of notes and information (so you can easily save tips and recommendations you hear about certain places). The attractions section is really helpful too as you can see what trips, tours and key sights places have to offer | It's really good at what it does, 4/5 stars because it auto assigns icons to itinerary items and doesn't always get it right, so it bothers my OCD that I can't edit them manually. Also a feature I would love to see implemented is car parking category with drop-off and pickup itinerary objects like you have for hotel check-in and checkout 🙂 | I like the idea of this but the App isn't always obvious to navigate. There should be an itinerary section. | Highly recommend for travel expenses calculator and making points where to go when | I'm using this app to plan my trip to Patagonia, and is just amazing, the best app for this. | Pretty good, I like the waypoint system, but the money section is confusing. | Picking and choosing locations on this app is great! Also sharing plans with friends is super easy. I enjoy the notes section to which helps to add on info that you dont want to forget about a certain place or location. I wish there was an option to change the color of the waypoints so you could put them into different categories. I also would have hoped to see the routes and a ""starred location"" that could lead routes from a particular location. | Great usability | It doesn't order automatically the dates of the itinerary. Also, it doesn't change the itinerary date if I change the trip date | Awesome app, easy to use with great and helpful feature! | Nice App to plan my interrail trip, good support, actively developed! | Such an amazing app to help set things up with a group of friends! Makes things so much easier | Great | A simple checklist can make the app perfect | So far so good in pre planning stage. However, when adding waypoint I wished there's an option that prompt us that we have added 'the place' before and if we like to add again. I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places. | Just started trip very good | Exactly what I've been looking for! This is a fantastic app that will allow you to simply plan every detail of your vacation. | The invitation flow is bad.. The link I got told me to open the app, hit the + button and put in the code. No link to the app on that page, no deep linking to just auto handle adding the trip. Some really low hanging fruit that would make the initial experience wayyyy better. After I downloaded the app manually, there was no plus sign fab until she had already added me manually to the trip by username, then the fab appeared. Overall beautiful design though! I really want this app to improve! :) | Easy to use | Best All-in-One Travel App | This app is great for trip planning, spending and keeping everything in one place. I have used it slightly differently in that I have recorded the information for trips I have done and while being on a trip. this has worked extremely well but I would like two additions. -to be able to add dates in the past (the app shows current dates and those in the future. -to be able to transpose the notes I have made to my computer. -I don't use my phone for e-mails and would like to be able to add documents to the app via my computer. Is any of this possible? It would be perfect if it could be! | It's great app for people like travel | Amazing and responsive customer service. I struggled to find an app that was simple yet powerful without trying to be clever, to keep track of travel plans. I finally found Lambus. One of the main features I was after was being able to store documents for the trip in a nice organised way. The only issue I had with the app was that trips were sorted by last edited rather than time. I asked the developers about it and a couple of days later it was in the latest release. Truly great customer service | So far, so good. I love that all our docs are in one place! We're in the middle of planning stages and I'm anxious to see how well the expenses work out for everyone | Really helps in managing trips with many useful features | Awesome | ok | I just returned from a 6-day Banff-Jasper- Calgary group trip yesterday and found this app recommended by Google Play. We were four families of 11 people. I created a trip and added all the waypionts. We uploaded many photos. The only suggestion for improvement is not to compress the photos uploaded and to allow downloading photos uploaded by other members in the same trip. Anyway, this is an app which will definitely help you plan, organize and document your group trip. l highly recommend it. | Cool! | Best app for planning trips with all the useful functions you can need both ahead of and during travel. | ok | Initial setup review - easy to register with Fb Google or own email. Straight into the app to register a trip. You can set your own title and the example uses the date of the trip. I did the same and the next input was the date of my trip, using a calendar, which began at today's date. It would have been helpful if it could take the date in the title as the starting point. Other participants were next and the app wouldn't recognise their emails if they had a space at the end. Many thanks. | nice see | Have to give one star for now. App freezes at login/register screen so can't even give it a try. Galaxy S7. | The idea is great and I look forward to improvements but it let me down when I tried to use it for international travel. There is no offline mode so I lost access to documents when I needed them. | just say excellent | app gets frozen when trying to create an account or connect via Google. Buttons are not responsive | great app, wish you could organize the itinerary a bit better | Planning my vacations in Brasil on your app is intuitive and easy | It has never been so easy to plan a trip | nice and useful app | What to add/change in future patches: Providing a way to change the date format from day-month-year to month-day-year, plus others. Actually changing the currency format when currency is set to something different. USD doesn't look like this example 9.50$. It should be like this $9.50. That symbol is always in the front of the numbers even for small change. It's not a deal breaker, but it can be for some people. Familiarity is important for this. People need to feel comfortable using your app. | great app for travelling! | The look is amazing. Expecting many more features in the future. Gonna plan my next trip on Lambus. | This is perfect app for traveling! | very nicely built mobile product | the idea is awesome but we are expecting features like notifications in group trips when ever some one make some updates on the trip","{""1"":90,""2"":54,""3"":216,""4"":198,""5"":1173}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $89.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Lambus GmbH","8170521690752506433","hello@lambus.com","https://www.lambus.com","Albert-Einstein-Str. 1

Love sharing my trips here with close family and friends. The ability to then create a book using the pictures and descriptions shared here is the best thing ever. Everyone in the family has at least one picture book from a trip tracked on Polarsteps. | Brilliant, helps you remember where you've been and where you are considering going and route planning | Epik 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 | So easy to follow along our friends' travels and to comment etc | Easy to use. Excellent mapping and take pics to see where you have been | World cruise, great to have our photos archived into the right place as we travelled round. Great our friends could see the steps as we travelled and comment on it. We are thinking on having the book. 350 pages but will be a memento of a great experience. The app. Is great glad we were told about it. | 😀 | Easy to use, nice layout | It's an excellent way to rell folk what you did and a reminder for yourself. It's really easy to use | Excellent app for sharing your adventures and photos. There are few minor glitches, the map adds air travel routes when none were taken, easily removed. Highly recommend if you are travelling. | The first time I am following someone, I like it. I'm going to use it on my next trip too. | Great app, a good way of keeping track of our journeys! | Love the app | The one thing that would make this app better is being able to tag other users in steps. It would add a whole new dimension and be a nice way to keep track of people you meet during your travels. | Start using your app, following some friend's travel almost on-time experience! The only problem I'm facing is that most of my followers are French & Spanish...and there is NO choice to have posts translated automatically! This option would save me time translating & sending my travel spots by other means... Another hic...replying direct to a comment is not personalized and looks confusing on the follow-up threads. Well overall good...need some ergonomic updates, so eagerly waiting for it... | Fantastic app to track your travels. Easy to use platform. | Absolutely cool app for travel and staying connected. | We have been an early adopter and really like it for tracking all if our travels. A must have app! | Great App, with accurate location it's only downfall is lack of animation (like Travelboast) once trip is complete | I have logged many trips over several years. Those photo journals are most precious possessions. Easy to use. And the printed books are worth it. | Very great app! Only thing that could improve is connecting 2 phones to 1 account and save drafts online so the other device can edit/add photos without posting them first. | Fanastic way to save memories in a chronological order | Great ap, especially the map | An excellent way of following friends and family on their adventures! | A great little app to record & share your travels. | Fabulous way to flow my friends trip. Now I am keen to use it myself. Easy to follow. | Excellent app, useful to keep family up to date and keep a record of your travels to fondly look back on later | Loving the way I can share my travels with friends and family | Great record of trips with photos and stories that is shareable. | Lovely way to record a journey. Nice features and easy to use, love that you can see on a map where you went. Will use again! | Easy to use . | Great travel app covering all your journey. | S'il y a bien une application à avoir pendant un voyage, c'est celle ci ! 🫶 Nous voyageons partout dans le monde et cette application nous motive à écrire et photographier quotidiennement ! En revanche, les suggestions de voyage ne sont pas suffisamment mises à jour, beaucoup de voyages ne sont plus d'actualité et datent d'il y a plusieurs années... Vous pouvez suivre notre tour du monde en stop ici : MarineSamuelTravel | Excellent 👍 | Great app to keep family and friends posted and also allows you to print your album | excellent app, love it for its functionality and easy use | It has been great at helping me keep connected to my daughter while she is travelling | Pretty good needed a bit more help learning to navigate the app | Enjoyable and for my level of requirement its just brilliant | Love it, easy to use. | Great app, good to see where you've been. | Great travel app. | Great app not only for the journey you are on, but also for recording your holiday retrospectively. | Great to follow friends' holiday | Great to | I like that it has privacy settings and is relatively easy to use. However, it is not always clear for those receiving the trip updates how to access it. | I'm watching my god daughter travelling and loving the updates | But does it have a wiggle effect so I can find ez | Simple, hugely useful and aesthetic | Beautiful app. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. prefer an option to convert a future planned trip to a past trip. It doesn't let you do that manually and only does it on its own when the travel tracker is switched on. If the phone battery ends, nothing can be done. The travel tracker creates its own steps instead of converting my planned steps. Also the past trip doesn't let you add number of nights stayed at a place. It doesnt let you select mode of travel - plane | Brilliant. | Polarsteps let's us record our trips across Europe whilst also allowing friends and families to follow what we are doing. We and our friends and families do love it | Brilliant app | It's a nice way to share travel experiences with friends and family. | Love this app. My family back home had peace of mind while I was travelling and could see everything I was doing! So easy to use as well! | We use since a few months and are very pleased by it. Our friends love to follow our adventures, when they have time and want to. | Great to share experience with family and friends | I love this app... I use it often. | Very nice | Great way to keep up to date with my boyfriend on his 6 month sabbatical. Some super cool, lovely interface features! Excited to start my blog properly soon too! | Daughter uses polar steps and so do I its a good app to see where people are | Great app, really easy to use and its such a nice way to track my travel | Pleasant experience | Fabulous app for recording holidays, sharing with friends and family | A great app to keep a record and pictures of the trips we do. It's easy to use and can be shared with friends as you travel. | Fabulous to track travels and keep photo record and memories of places you have been | Love the app. Works great. Good way to record our trips and share with family. | Great app, very impressed with it | It would be nice if every attached picture might have an own description. It would be also nice if the whole route might be exported into gpx format. And it would be nice if Polarsteps map finds small villages or places too. At the moment it doesn't. | First time of using - Fabulous | Easy to use, fun, works well | Good quality | A 'new' user of Polarsteps. Been great to use...navigate around. | Very good so far | Easy to use. Great way to keep pictorial and journal records of trips | I feel like I'm on the journey too. | Useful for keeping a record of a trip. Helps others to share your adventure. | Great way to follow the adventures of our son | Very difficult to delete, set dates, can't delete steps and try again, stuck in a loop of ""trip overlaps another' that I cant delete. Really user unfriendly, a help page would be great. | Een super app om reisverhalen op te schrijven. Het is een fijne manier om alle vrienden en familieleden op de hoogte te houden. Helaas is het nog niet mogelijk om met twee accounts een gedeelde reis te maken, dat zou een fijne toevoeging zijn. | Génial pour partager ses photos de voyage en temps ( presque) réel ! | Absolutely Fabulous! | Love this app! | Great app, highly recommend | Good tracking app | I am not tech smart, and it was easy enough for me. It guided me on each step of set-up, and let me journal the highlights easily. | Excellent way to track your journey 👌 | Great app, easy to use keeping family and friends updated on your whereabouts. | Used this app to record our 2 year trip across Canada. Great to save memories of where we had been and what we had seen. Also great to share it with friends and family so they could see our adventures. It's a bit spotty when you loose signal and have to put pins in manually but 9 times out of 10 it does a perfect job. | Amazing experience. To be able to track the movements of our travellers was a real gift. | Polarsteps make it very easy to keep track of your trip and is really easy to use. I'm not particularly tech-savvy but figured everything out with no problems. I haven't made a travel book yet, but still value having the trips to look back on in Polarsteps. I also enjoy following my friends and family on their trips, fun to see where they are, and also great to see places for your own future trips. | My favorite travel-app. Tracking works well and reliable, i even could show a hiking route in a remote area. | Brilliant app - tracking, photos and comments. Just what I needed for my cycle journey along the Silk Road. | Good app 👍 | Great app, I used it to track my stops from my Asia trip | Easy to navigate good ti see the maps etc fir more perspective | Great way to document our trips away and share with family and friends. | Love being able to follow our Dutch friends as they travel across America.","{""1"":2482,""2"":2068,""3"":2068,""4"":7447,""5"":71906}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Polarsteps","Polarsteps","support@polarsteps.com","https://www.polarsteps.com",,"https://www.polarsteps.com/privacy","Polarsteps","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OoGygeN5QPb0boLM9ljuPrmYNqWK4FidNKiRVEvnevJbBd5tUvpCslQnnPkJyvEfnLSa","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kVO82NAqtE54gagBirYZ1IgXDgN_Ax7uNMjRhQTTCtn2GGo2-rB3VgxFBu6iI7X-IVMX","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IofTUFztBVIqxgZYkkOwqfLLoewF6TJXCoUVOEmUkaEU4x9e0H8k2KvyO5XOIGtomw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pj89FzQ9nI5tAUkCvYvz-jCjBBpARyj_iYhQfVk4b5nJkxDLWTEiSUXBaJsdJ6BZbKC5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WS_tGHckn8tOcSYjvbb66GK3fl5bUeE--MOLSd3O9El9LBfJ8Dz1COImSiMhkyv7cA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5ivaZHITQW1Z0ih870grcZS4DM1OQJ0yFLI0vmHq6d0wXQE2lkSt3cvhyL-xGFZtwO2-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sRwn5zcHEQooHFDGo5Ve34HsLVY1nnkWLLuZiuGDlwdlc7PQrR6I__V968veO27JQLV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ejx00g0PlCm_sz1LMrqx_6wY7jCRCsi0XxFPuBuQ_Lioq_aOGxIfgNFBAZAs5O8DIZg""]",,,,"Teen",,false,"Sep 28, 2016",1714196274000,"7.2.1","Start planning your next trip!

If planning a summer trip during winter months. Winter closers will led to poor decision making because winter closers are used during summer planning. Also needs a daily distance calculation on the map to figure how far you can go on a day run. Have to use Google maps to check runs and figure distances. Won't renew because it can't be trusted. | Plenty of benefits to use on this app, highly recommend the premium version. | I installed, then checked restaurants around my local area only to find the list to be way outdated with many on the list closed down years ago. I can't rely on an app that doesn't keep its info up to date and relevant, so I immediately uninstalled it. | Do not waste your money on the worthless app it does nothing that Google maps doesn't do except it sucks and cannot even find state parks | Greed. I paid $36 back in February 2024 and I opened up the app and discover I no longer have access to almost all my planned trips. They require I spend even more money to unlock them. So to get everything I had for like the past three years again I need to pay $60. I just use Google and PowerPoint to plan my trips. Very disappointed. | Great planning guides with accurate and safe routes for our camper | Bought the upgrade but can't even sign into the app. No pop up telling me the issue - just a blip then nothing. | Was a good app till they changed the payment system I had trips loaded they are now all of a sudden locked and now they tell me I have to pay more money to access those trips | This app has helped me easily plan car trips to see family without having to cross between numerous other applications. They've integrated so much into one that it's a breeze for me to map out a plan with overnight stays. | Love the app but asking way too much money. A pro membership is middle of the road, only gets you 5 trips, and is $50 a year. The basic option gets you nothing. Hate that apps are so greedy. Apparently being a loyal customer for years means nothing. Absolutely ridiculous. Not only are you asking for more money but you blocked my access to trips I already have planned. | Use this because I have the Campendium package. I use it for planning only, still do Google for each days run. Like being able to look up attractions along our route. | Terrible app, don't waste your money. I have the premium version and it's utterly worthless. The route optimization is completely broken, causing the route to double back hundreds of miles to certain stops, literally take you in circles when you could reach each of the destinations in a fraction of the time, and no amount of manual rearranging fixes it. I wasted hours adjusting everything and eventually gave up. I have no idea how they charge to use the app. It can't do the one thing it should. | Couldn't do anything without making an account. | I did not enjoy this at all. App demanded I sign up, so I did, I tried to look at two things and it said I needed to upgrade. Tried to delete account, followed their support doc, can't delete account. Thanks for the headache. Would not recommend to anyone with a human body or brain. | Trash app. Useless | Helpful ideas! | Doesnt work. What a waste of time | You need to pay for an expensive year long membership to plan anything with more than two stops | Used to be a 5 star app but they've moved eveything that made the app functional behind a paywall. You can no longer see your old trips and can only add 1 stop now. The paid version is also worse than it used to be. Waypoints have gone from 150 to 20 for basic or 50 for pro and you only get 3 saved trips (less than the old free version). The map used to filter well but is now clogged with unrelated adds(ex. Hotels show up when you are looking for sites or attractions) | I found the desktop experience really helpful to plan a roadtrip we took. It provided some really interesting things to see along the way. The reason for the 3 stars, however, is the desktop UI could be better. As well, the app version, at least for Android, is really not useful I've found. Despite downloading the maps, it complained about lack of internet connection and so we had to rely on Google Map downloads. | Awesome app! easy to use. Has a lot of excellent features. | Please add dump station search! | Great app. Very useful. I love the map. Easy to plan out a road trip. Not confusing to use. Good information 👍 | I haven't used it yet, however I like that it keeps track of the height of the vehicle. I'm assuming it will show diesel stations, however it would be nice to differentiate diesel #2, B20, and Renewable 99%. Our manufacturer says avoid B20 and never R99. | Used to let you do a few pins on the map now it's fewer with free. Almost non existent. I don't travel enough to pay for the app/site. | Still needs work. I don't like the inability of the map point automatically to center on the camp I select on the left panel. | So I put hours of my time in to planning a trip this spring only to have them lock my trip because they changed the tiers. They locked the one single trip I was actively working on and want me to pay even more to get access to it. I have all my reservation numbers and notes in this app. Sketchy af and they won't be getting any more of my money. Way to screw over your customers, roadtrippers! | This app sucks n it's very hard to use | I like the service but the app keeps crashing and since unusable. I guess I'll have to cancel during my free trial. Darn | Live the mapping and all of the sights that are not on everyone's radar | Wouldn't let me create an account | Crashes on road | Dated interface. There's no apparent curation of opportunities that are suggested for your roadtrip. Expensive subscription still comes with ads, no premium features, and a limit of 3 plans and 20 stops. My request for a refund or prorated cancellation was denied. | Invaluable summer of 2021 - 8 day 2500 mile trip beautifully planned and organized in advance, changed in real time with Roadtrippers. Things wewe so familiar - because I'd already been there many times - virtually. My perfect tool! 2024 update - Upgraded. WORTH IT! DO IT! App is priceless now. When you search for locations, you may need to try slightly different search before it finds it - minor inconvenience | At first, a reasonable number of trips/stops were free minus advanced features. Then that limit was trapped behind the subscription, locking you out of trips you had already made. Then that subscription costs more _and_ gets more limited, so you have to pay for the next tier just to maintain what you've had. ""Free"" accounts are not really useable now (1 destination with 1 stop). And more and more POI are out of date or just have incorrect locations. Avoid this service. | Would really like to subscribe but current version will not let me. | Can't do anything without an account. Useless. | This is my go-to before leaving for trips! | Can't get it to work | I cancelled prior to my free trial being over and yet I was still charged a ridiculous expensive fee for what this app is. I emailed customer support and was told I was now the proud owner of a year long premium subscription that I don't want and there is nothing that can be done ""per contract"". If you're looking for a travel app stick to Google maps or go to Wanderlog. A lot cheaper and not sketchy. | Total scam, Google and tripadvisor are free and do more than this does without a ripoff double digit subscription | So easy to plan routes, see what's worth visiting and check out accommodation. Excellent app for long road trips. | I will not be making my trip until late to the end of April. Should I sign out? Don't want any trouble or problems ✌️ Thank you | I don't spend much time online. So when I downloaded this app and logged in using Facebook and my Facebook was mysteriously hacked the next day.. kind of makes me think the 2 things are related. Also there was a major pay wall to using the app FYI | 👍 app for information | A promising app which is not yet ready for prime time. | Travelling made easier with all the options this app offers. | So far so good. | Would like to unsubsidized from this app but there is no way to do so and our card was just charged for another year. Stop | Useless in Europe. I am at a very busy tourist area but the app shows no shops, restorans or hotels. When I tried to find a grocery by name the app shows only list of US located stores. The app has permission to access my location but it doesn't help | Still no Android Auto support! It is to bad as that would make this a world class app. | Would not let me create log in. | Need paid subscription to do anything other than one location. Why not just use Google maps at that point which is free. | Z×foot 4knu, | I bought the $36 plan, planned a trip, and saved it for when the time comes to officially plan out the trip. NOW, it's saying I have used up my basic plan and won't allow me to review, or edit the trip I started. SCAM! | Love it! | I had a subscription a year ago. Didn't renew because of poor maps. Got a notice that Roadtrippers was updated and better. Don't know what the updates were, but it doesn't matter because of the poor maps. I will be canceling again. If you ever improve your maps, I will come back. Make a map like the old Rand McNally paper maps and I will be back. Your maps have poor contrast between the map background and roads. When I zoom out, seconbary state roads and major county roads dissappear. | I am trying to plan a 2 week road trip around California. There is an area around Big Sur on hwy 1 that is 1.9 miles between parks, both of which are on Hwy1. The app and the desk top are both diverting me and making this a 5 hour trip. It is right in the middle of my trip up the coast making it very hard to accurately plan out. May have to cancel this subscription and find a different app. Overall the app seems user friendly, but, clearly not accurate. I hope they can resolve this issue. | I do a lot of road trips, and this app is great for planning. It will arrange stops in a logical way, but it will also allow me to move them if desired. I love the feature that lets you see the stops on a map, so I can see if a stop is too far of my desired trip route. The app can also give great suggestions for whatever your favorite thing to see on your travels is. I wish it included more hiking trailheads, but I can typically get somewhat close to where I want to go. | Love the way it pops a new waypoint into where it should be along your trip & that you can put in dates. | Campendium is shutting down and we are forced to use this app? It's worthless. No links to the blm sites, no cell coverage information, no reviews at all. | We are taking the kids and my mom on a multi destination vacation out west. I had the route mapped out. Thenstarted looking for all those cheesey touristy quick roadside attraction and photo ops. I was having a very difficult time finding them and then adding them in the right order. We got the pro package. My wife and I can now look and plan things together, and the app pin points them in the right order on our trip! It's a great tool! | Terrible trip planning. Impossible to do everything I thought I signed up for. | Gps kept thinking we were on roads we were not and it just stopped routing when I change routes. | Edit: A good company trying to make the best trip app possible. Not my favorite but you can count on them to resolve problems! | Google maps works much better. This app is severely lacking. | I cannot believe that after paying 39.99 for years I suddenly went to login and was told I need to pay even more to now have access to all of my saved trips and it won't even let me choose which of the three trips I'm now limited to seeing and the ones I need now are locked! The only way to get access to them is to pay more or delete all of the other trips I have planned/put hard work into! Shame on them!! | Great app/service to help us plan road trips, getaways, and vacations. Highly recommend | Fun and Easy to use. | They killed this app. You can't even make a trip anymore without having a paid subscription. Used to be six or seven free waypoints when making a trip, now it's three. What a joke. | Great app for planning adventures | Almost impossible to cancel premium subscription. I have never used this service and they have been charging me for multiple years. App hangs when I click on manage subscription to try to cancel and nobody responds to customer service messages. Beware. | Not android friendly and difficult to cancel membership | Great for RV or car travel. | Doesn't have Thailand in it | $49 a year....don't waste your money! | Even with my subscription that allows 3 trips, I can't access a previous trip. There should also be a setting to prevent the app from changing dates or moving stops around. | I have to pay money to avoid highways on your app are you serious, I only own small displacement motorcycles going on the highway is literally impossible for me lol I hate capitalism with a fiery passion. | App is just okay the problem is when they auto renew your subscription with no notice and even if you try to cancel it on the same day they basically tell you too bad and charge you anyway, but hey, you can still use it. | I downloaded the app and that was the only thing that went right. You can't change the path unless you add a useless waypoint to point you in another direction. You can't add dates to specific waypoints. There is no summary sheet of any of the data you enter on each waypoint and on and on. I wasted 4 hours and he ave deleted the app and WILL NEVER try to use it again. Worst program I've ever encountered in all of my days since cell phones came out! | toooo expensive and I still have to use Google Maps. | Suddenly you go from having a free option, to asking for a minimum $40/mo... which is absolutely insane. | I have used Roadtrippers many times in the past with great success. Changes to the app have made it so much more difficult to use. I keep adding things to my trip on certain days and when I move things the app will shift things to the wrong day. We rent houses so I keep the house address at the end of every day since that is where we return to. The app keeps trying to group the house listings together. Once I put something on a day, it should stay there. | No no no | I had the absolute worst customer service from this company that I've ever had. She was rude, unreasonable, and sending irrelevant ""help"" to my issue by just copying and posting FAQs or giving irrelevant answers. I think I've only had five companies this bad in my lifetime and this goes down as one of the worst of those 5. | I had the TOGO RV app that gave me RV driving time as opposed to car driving time. Since TOGO was no longer available, I received a link to Roadtrippers which doesn't have this feature. It's also very difficult to navigate. | Disappointed. Just doesn't do what it advertises. Canceling free trial subscription. Worse than being a poorly designed app, the interface flaws cause me anger. | I have had a subscription for 5 years or so. We haven't used the app much, but I kept the subscription ""just in case."" This year we are planning a couple of big road trips and thought we would finally use the service we've been paying for all this time. I had started putting together itineraries and getting plans together. Last night I found that my $35 subscription gets me almost nothing and I wasn't informed that it was changing 🤬. I can't access my saved trips from my phone. | Not going to pay 50 bucks for a map. App makers have gotten greedy. 5.00 a month I'd have been All in but not paying a tank of fuel for what I can do myself with a cheap map. Free version includes 3 stops, a 2000 mile trip requires 5 or 6 fuel stops alone not even including motels and rest stops. No monthly option, no thanks! | It's good glad to have it | Amazing tool for Trip planning. I have used it for probably 20 road trips. I like to add many places to visit, and then just switch them off if we aren't in the mood. Keeps a good record of the places we have been. Premium version is well worth the expense. | Not working | I was so disappointed with the new interface. I used the free version of this app in the past and loved finding things along my route to visit while seeing some targeted ads. Most of the features I loved are gone. The current free version is SO hard to even navigate around, I'm just removing the app. I would buy guides for vacations but can't justify a subscription, especially with as bad as it is to use. Sad to see a good product ""improved"" to the point of uselessness. | Edit* deleted the app because it would no longer let me pull it up on the browser. It auto opened the app. Once deleted I could use it on browser again.* After using this for a while: I LOVE roadtripper.... but I'm not a big fan of the app. It's much easier to use on desktop. But since the accounts connect you can do research and set everything up on desktop but have the trip easy to pull up at a moments notice via the app so still worth while. If you're having trouble use it on desktop :) | Subscribed to premium program not easy program to add things to...dates, plan stops prior leaving on trip. I don't think program is worth the $$ Goggle maps is about the same and it is free. | Seemed like user friendly platform, price is way too much for what it is. | Tried it for a bit, but there are too many things behind a paywall (that are free in other apps), and the fee is over $80/year CAD for premium and over $65/year CAD for the cheaper Pro Tier. Basic tier lacks too many features to be useful for me. | Crashes whenever you try to navigate. Product is full of advertisements which is not acceptable for a paid app. Application keeps popping up messages to renew or give a gift to a friend. Product does not include a calendar which is kind of useless considering it's supposed to be a trip planner!","{""1"":2149,""2"":509,""3"":335,""4"":953,""5"":4123}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$6.99 - $59.99 per item","10","10","VARY","Roadtrippers","Roadtrippers","support@roadtrippers.com","https://roadtrippers.com","131 E McMicken Ave

Why can't I create my own plan with the things I want to see? Useless app | great | Top place not showing, Cannot add more than city ☠️☠️☠️☠️👩‍❤️‍👩🤮🤮🤮🤮 Wasted money | Imagine sending you for Indian meals every day when you're on a trip to Japan. Fix your bugs. | Family option only shows children under 8. what the hell is this. | I tried to use it on a recent visit to Krakow, but it was just to dependant on the assumption that we had a car, with journeys and hour and half pit of the city and missing many local attractions or locations. | Purchased the pro plan. Now I'm receiving an error every time I open the app. | 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀👻👻 | cheapest app not for any use 😟 | Purchase pro to share plans with my family and it gives an error code and will not share. I deleted all and reinstalled three app, same problem. | Only works with google account, no outlook mail no other. Too bad! | Adult only trip and no interest in museums but app recommended children's museum along with many other museums, not sure why it even has you input your interests. | I'm trying to create a route for hitchhiking from one city to another across India and make a map of my suggested route with suggested sights/activities along the way. there no way to do that, it only lets you explore an individual city within a set time frame. | I can't change the suggested restaurants from an itinerary 😔. | Although the AI part is great, I couldn't create my own travel plan | stupid app | Why go to Japan only to eat in Indian restaurants | That price for one month not worth at all. | Good idea but not for me. | Indian cities not added yet | Needs a lot of work to be useful | Politically Manipulated | Quite off target, only one 1 of 4 days planned. | There is no option for resterant | It makes you drive all over the place. Attractions that are right next to each other are planned on separate days. Bad planner. | Never finishes itinerary | Very poor app. Waste of money | I could have Googled and got better response. | Its not free ,, its not one payment ,, monthly payment almost 4$ | How can you ask fro payment without trying the service?? | Has potential, wasted $6 (not free anymore?). Itinerary keeps driving me around 2 cities that are 1 hour apart: locations 1-3-5 in one and 2-4-6-7 in the other! What a joke! Removal of the attraction doesn't work. Says, it's removed, but it's still there... Suggests to visit places for 2 hours, even though on details it shows the place closes in 25 minutes after arrival. Very poor AI. There are much better apps that are free and more logical. | Didn't help at all, | No food selection choices. Remove activity does not work at all. Useless recommendations that a simple Google search of 'best places to visit' would beat. | Maximum 10 days. Loads of questions before a trip is shown. Requires sign up. Uninstall. | the plan i'm being given is very simple and very minimal, it's taking too much time | Warthless ... poor program .. | Poor app, provides same places, doesn't save the previous configs and selected options, provides activities within activities didn't select. I'm not damn interested about mesumes. | The software now only by pay | doesn't work | good | very useful | The locations and attractions area need to be up to date. | It is very limited and not helpful | Nice app | The app should let the user change the found places or suggest based on feedbacks and other internet resources.

Maybe will improve later on because it looks like a new app but right now not to impressive. | despite eliminating historical sights the app added them! | Necesita información sobre logística de transporte. Y poner los monumentos más importantes de cada ciudad. Las sugerencias de restaurante tienen que ser cerca de donde estas de turista en ese momento, no al otro lado de la ciudad solo para ir a comer caro y ni siquiera comida local. Si tiene varios días en una ciudad como Londres, necesita segmentar por áreas. | alot of bugs and no results if you select 12 day, also i selected luxury but still add for me cafeterias and cheap restaurants and only parks. | Worst app, it do not show nice and famous places | Has so little amount of places... | They have really less citys, most of the world don't exist | Excellent application, take advantage 👏 | Faltu, not updated | super | India places not added | Only showed 1 plan, I tired for other other country then the app gets stuck at 100% | Limited Cities you can plan with this, developer should know there are plenty of other options out there | Never loaded | Busqué 7 ciudades dentro de la plataforma, y resulta que ninguna apareció, mencionandome que esa ciudad no estaba en la lista y que pronto me notificaría cuando estuviera lista.

Nicely done with the tips on all the countries | Best on computer | Great experience! Amazing getting travel inspiration crowdsourced! | So i really like the product... however, i cannot access my previous trips or planned trips without internet... that makes it useless for me on actual trip :/ please built in possibility to access my stuff offline. | It's nice to have an app where I can search for travel inspiration, plan my trips and share my memories, all in one place. In the beginning I found a bit confusing to navigate as it handles a lot of information, but then I got used to it. And it's good to see itineraries from all over the world. | Complicated and very long to use | Great idea - isn't saving my trip plans. Lots of wasted time. | Amazing app to help you get inspired, and to plan your trip. Highly recommended! | Super easy to use and store pics from my vacation. Can't wait to use on my trip next month. | Na první release appka vypadá skvěle. Lehce se ovládá a uživatel snadno najde inspirace pro své cesty. Přidávání cesty je intuitivní a jednoduché a skvěle poskládá cestu pouze z fotek. Plánování vypadá též dobře, itinerář cesty pěkně v kapse. Chtělo by to trošku zapracovat na optimalizaci a doladit zepár chyb ale nijak vážně to zatím neubírá dojmu aplikace. | 🥳 | So happy this app exists! It helps me organize all my travels in my personal online Travel diary (so much better than the paper version haha). Following other travelers is really fun and inspiring too 🌍 Can't wait to try it for trip planning this summer! I must say - every traveler needs this app. It's so nice to keep track of every trip! | Super appka pro plánování dovci. Support | Great App! Simple, intuitive and still it have everything what I need.

The new feature that allows you to set when the day starts for touring is a welcome capability. I've used this in multiple cities around the world. | Wow, downloaded for our upcoming trip to Oslo and the first thing on all the itineraries is the Viking Ship Museum.

The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City™ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan.

There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Job👍 | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing 😍 | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | tốt | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for.","{""1"":373,""2"":74,""3"":448,""4"":1718,""5"":15168}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$4.99 - $49.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Visit A City","Visit+A+City","team@visitacity.com","http://www.visitacity.com",,"https://www.visitacity.com/privacy","Visit+A+City","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2RPjnl2F36udTYWeutrdLcu67q8_OjyC4akOyHaN2RVrY2dY2L_gtt04EPP7UL9Npw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vtnEcCq94fAWcilxpK0K5ZADfDqJn7OGC_egYCh_5lT9pJb7x2bViFY9kdT8J-DXjE9m","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D2_XgwZ1SQkYV6Xq3Fm3gxcwF87A2N8z9dOdQtOG6SGEU2pkMksKBBt5QydcF2KRUz0v"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2SENJd17-wP8uZPVhg7eEpLr-4gBct3zFJmzAi-h2mk25lSEWKCowjbS5zvEwfFXkQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a0x2IJJbqjqGuAVFJL8sIqKHhjHMO4Xn6og_GxS5Yp0wEK6VShpwoa1tbdBHt1RZuNQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PhyVZRZI-4yBnVVU2-L1Ql8CI9qeAdimYek9WKDbNrSmv7vcshiUn8ijVtfSoxfDrxU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L9ZEr3UsxS-cDPdHAp4hy3a51y2YjIw9XRlZJIrKFZ8_e0spYDYPEylDA8AprTX6XW8q""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Apr 23, 2015",1705430569000,"4.1.59","Visit A City, the ultimate travel companion, just got even better!

After using the app for 6 years without issue, I recently went to book a hotel and the app had changed my location to USA for some reason. Rather than showing the currency as USD, it simply showed a $ sign and I mistakenly assumed that my app was still in CAD, like it had been for 6 years prior. Instead, I booked a hotel for a good rate and was pleased. Was very displeased to find the increased rate when I showed up at hotel. I'm out. | I was not given the information to cancel my reservation and be refunded. I will never use Expedia again. | BC ccacrs d | good site for traveling. | not working for car reservation | always helpful and great choices! | Love the app. Always find deals on great stays. | Very good | Easy to use and the prices can't be beat. I have been using Expedia to plan my vacations for years. | easy to find tickets and cheap flights | User friendly, it's great 😃 | They'll cancel your booking without any reason and without any prior information. No one responds on their customer care number. They take no interest in your problems | I booked a flight on the web page and the app showed my flight for about 10 seconds, then showed the ""Oops something went wrong"" page and now the app claims I have no bookings on two different devices, even after reinstalling. Glad I have an old fashioned e-mail confirmation of my flight! The app has now been uninstalled, fix your garbage app, please! | horrible customer service and support. Not able to talk to a person. | I was overcharged by just over $130 using Expedia. I spoke with customer support to figure out what the fees were for. I even sent a copy of my reciept from the hotel showing the actual cost. They only offered to look into refunding, but denied it. Even a partial refund was denied. The points system is a joke too unless you travel often (more than 3 times a year) and/or outside your country. I was a loyal customer for several years, but never again. This company puts profits over people. | Easy and efficient.y | Good website to navigate, and customer service, prices are very competitive. | grateful to off found you | Easy to reserve, pick-up and drop-off. | My go-to to book ANY trip! | Don't like their return policy and can be run around in order to get a refund or credit. | never a glitch always great deals | wow | I normally fly with jetblue, but on occasion, I find better prices in Expedia. | fantastic, i uses for all my travels!!! ufff | Beautiful everything was perfect | Cannot beet the savings❣️ | love it | 95% of the time, Expedia offers the best prices period! Customer service is top notch! The bundling option saves so much money! I go to Expedia 1st, then I check everybody else, and then, I'm right back with Expedia. | Amazing App. Has saved me a lot of $$$ | Not able to login, tried several time....😢🥺 | Easy as pick, and click, click, done | great customer service and best prices with reliable airlines and hotels! | great and easy | Been using Expedia for years. Easy to use app and good prices. | Easy booking. Thanks | I can't search flights. I type the city but nothing happen | great | reliable | was awesome, little effort 👌 | I can no longer log in. The app has stopped recognizing my Gmail account or my actual login credentials. Prior to this, I found the app very convenient, handy, and intuitive. I've booked a ton of trips through them. They web page still works fine. | wonderful comparisons | Been using Expedia to book flights, hotels, cars and packages for over 10 yrs. Never had any issues and customer service has always been helpful when I need them. I never use anything else. | I was quoted a price that went upon payment as apparently Expedia give you the motels price. They then on more to pay Expedia on top of this.. Cheaper not to use Expedia - no deals with them in fact costs more to use Expedia | Supper buggy can't book anything on this trash app | easy | Horrible app. makes errors on a regular basis.you will lose a lot of money if you try to book using this app. stay away. | I've been using Expedia for years. I always like how convenient and acceptable the prices are. really great for last minute searches and I've only needed to use assistance once and all of these years. | It's the original and still the best travel booking app in my opinion. Enough said. | very easy to book flights | Awesome site to use when planning trips. | poor on costumer service | prompted to | acceptable prices , customer friendly app. | Easy to work around | The puzzles to prove I was not a bot made the app unusable. I would get verified, the screen would load, and then go back to doing a puzzle to prove I wasn't a bot. The process just kept repeating like a glitch. I had it less than 24 hours and deleted it. | Used to love the app, hate the changes that were made and now it has logged me out and will NOT allow me to log back in to my account. I've cleared history/cashe, I've rebooted my phone and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and nothing works. Very unhappy with this app right now. | Half the time the app won't let me enter a destination for a hotel search making it utterly useless. | 👍🏽 | Only lets you choose a 29 day window, if you like to go somewhere for more than a few weeks then you can't do it through this site. Also, prices are cheaper individually (through hotel directly and flight directly through their own sites) for the same dates and locations. Two stars because I used to enjoy this site when I didn't know how to book different aspects of my travel for myself but now it's not something I'll use because there are better prices to be found with little research. | unable to connect the trip itinerary from website to app, will probably just continue to use the website | easy to use | hard to navigate, won't keep my current screen open | Best App for Flights and Hotels | I love it ❤️ | love that I can easily cancel as needed. | easy and life saving | The app isn't working. Everytime I sign in it freezes. | I love how Expedia fine great hotels | Expedia used to protect and support customers when booking through them. I used them since the beginning. Nowadays, we get to our Destination and find out about all of the additional, non disclosed fees such as that 50USD cleaning fee per day. From now on, I'll be booking everything myself to avoid surprises. | excellent app | Excellent fare choices and prices! | I only use expedia! for domestic AND international travel. | Easy to use app. Great way to find accommodation quickly. | I love discounts and convenience, especially when making last-minute plans. | setup hotel stay for vacation. last year.

Sells fake reservations with a ""no refunds"" policy. | love Expedia! quick and efficient | Expedia has made travel so much easier. Gives you options. | Mainly use Expedia for cruises but they inexplicably removed the ""departure port"" filter??? So it's basically useless since I'm not going to scroll through hundreds of cruises hoping that I come across my port eventually. | I've used Expedia for years and it's never failed. Great deals and Customer Service is excellent at assisting with any last minute changes. | love it | good clean rooms for good prices 👌 | Always logs out in the middle of bookings.

Tells you exactly what bus to catch, when, and where basically anywhere in the world. Even better and more accurate than asking the locals. | Love the app but it will not let me login by using the app | Good apps | It quick and on point 💯 two 👍 up. | very useful | Utterly reliable | Easy to navigate, reliable, covers many regions. | my go to app | A great one stop shopping experience for figuring out where to go next and how to get there... | Options are often not reliable. Some options are not shown. Some shown are not available. | Brilliant app | Helped us during our DIY trip in Singapore! | Great idea, executed brilliantly | So helpful not only getting around abroad but also traveling around the USA. I love this app | Use it with every trip ! | Rome2Rio is my go-to app whenever I'm planning a trip anywhere in the world. I also use it for local purposes. I love that it provides information about multiple transportation options with approximate prices. SO helpful! | Excellent app. Would not want to travel without. The maps are terrific. All modes of transport are shown. Links are so helpful. | Messy. | Great app for travel in Europe | Excellent | Route information given by app doesn't give the optimum route possible. On one test, the most efficient and direct route wasn't even one of the options available. The problem is that the app may actually be trying to be too precise, rather than look at a general location in the area, that general location would have probably resulted in the optimum route, but because it was too precise, a less optimum route was shown. I don't think I would rely on this app to actually get to a destination. | Love the versatility | Very useful for trip planning.👍👍👍 | Great app for travelling. Very detailed | Together with Google Maps these are your go to guides. I have travelled now to give very diverse countries and I rely on this app heavily. Two thumbs up from me. | Must have app I would be so lost without it! | Multi-route feature removed. | MISLEADING!! Do Not rely on Rome2Rio data. Gave me lots of options for a bus trip. After going to buy tickets, none of them exist. NONE! Worse still, that bus route doesn't exist. I did the searching a couple months ago, and today Rome2Rio shows the same false availability. our plans are ruined. Not impressed. | Lovely app | Easier youbto enjoy the world trip | This app very easy and comfortable.. | Indispensable in planning a trip abroad. | The best | I tried with many places in different countries, It's very, very, very good. | Omg it help me a lot vist London as fresh. | Great details | Super | Great help for travellers! Thanks! | Very helpful - long distance or just over to the mext town. | Make reservations for transportation so easy! | Brilliant. | Best app bhai!! | Very useful for advice and ideas how to get there. | It's really helpful. Being a solo traveller It's my local guide anywhere any time... keep it up | A very helpful app when traveling! | It is excellent great help for planning trips everywhere in the world, and it's where I start | Always helpful anywhere we travel!! | Really useful. I appreciate that it doesn't hold me to a particular date and time but lets me review my options. Seems to cover everywhere I want to go. And of course the multimodal transport choices are the killer feature. | Very useful | Can't sync itinerary with computer to app. No sign in so all info you input on computer doesn't carry over | Very useful app! | Rome2rio is my go to app whenever I plan my travel I wouldn't ever travel without first consulting rome2rio | Very flexible access to travel planning options | Really helps you plan your trip. | Never been disappointed | Excellent & Fantastic app for Travellers . | Exceptional! | Wherever. We go in the world this app is 100% amazing x Thanks a million!!! | Always spot on! Used it in many different countries when traveling, and when planning Never disappoints. | it is helpful app for transportation in Europe (Crotone) | R2R was working okay but last few weeks has been unresponsive and glitch on my Samsung Android. Uninstalled, cleared cache, made sure system updates were recent, etc. Reinstalled and same issues so I am bailing on it. | I like this application, it helped me a lot to travel abroad. Thanks a lot. | Very usefull | Best app for budget travellers like me , just awesome liked it | Excellent, very stable and solid options | Good | Wonderful way to easily make an informed decision about my travel options. | Good | Great for trip planning. | C'est vraiment très précis, grâce à ses créateurs | The app is great if you want a general overview of the route, but compared to the website it doesn't give you nearly as much information. | It's accurate and lightning ⚡ fast👍 | GAWD awful on my older Motorola Android. Uninstalled! | Amazing information on otherwise hard to find connections | Exceptionally easy app to use to see all modes of transport from A to B. Very accurate times and information help you plan your journeys. | Useful | Easy to use. Great info and app! | Useful and easy to use | Very useful for travel using various modes of ground transportation | I've used this app to help plan my travels in Uruguay & Brazil. Nearly every journey has been wrong, either buses that don't exist, always incorrect durations (add an hour or two if you are planning connecting buses). I have found so many better options when I have gone to the bus terminals, with direct routes, destinations and alternative bus companies not shown on the app. The app does however, give you a good indication of routes that are available. | Detailed and accurate information, saved us so many times using public transport abroad, love this app | A great up for my self rely travel..very accurate when it comes to transportation. | Helped me travel across Portugal, Spain, Catalonia, France, Monaco, Luxembourg, Belgium & Netherlands. | Useful | Used extensively for trains, planes and other transport right through Europe from London to Naples | Easy to use, showing alternate routes | Damn good | Excellent Excellent Excellent | Effectively help for navigating new areas. | instead of giving the cheapest ways ""for example (casablanca morocco to casablanca airport) it said taxi but taxi is the most expensive choice [35 dollars], you can do by train and it's easier and cheaper [5dollars]. also the app is not giving opportunity to add or correct things . i would give less than a star if i could . 👎 | Why this app always 'hang' nowadays? Frustrating! | Exceptional | Easy to use | doesn't work well on Android. can't get out of settings. | Has helped me plan how to get aroind in almost every part of the world. Before I leave amd when I'm traveling. Great! | Buggy since migrating from Fetch My Way. It hangs after one or two searches. Not very usable. | Good app | The best trip planner ever.. | Very friendly easy and informative.","{""1"":260,""2"":260,""3"":102,""4"":205,""5"":4455}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"5.0","5.0","VARY","Rome2Rio Pty Ltd","Rome2Rio+Pty+Ltd","feedback@rome2rio.com","https://www.rome2rio.com/",,"https://www.rome2rio.com/privacy-policy/","Rome2Rio+Pty+Ltd","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a024hUcWexzK5buEeu7tXevB3vEWxzDzfZ7TLpXzBPXFdFB3mwGHFUdz0IOhVXO-1Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dHUe_zGRbBoH_PSAqvr4cngWOlgzE-MDk52N1BXx2abxwB_uRMC_RMngkYylqPfJcRw","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PhvYQWuy9rDYfgS1WLOUXkJUi3VEbnFmKyCEaQuCpKzdel18kw-O4mjQfVLVWr-qKOM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/86073j3DdijDsAhJnP-cww5Pybc4zz7WaAprdmnL9iL74Sp1E2logcMBNgHtAi3kAQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KBaEyN0vsYLBJuNAyMsLu4ZYaw5N005NdPH4zD4lCRZgnYeQuVPcdjdKUMurLITeTfc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yxLeRNHFg5UtYvDEn3vxvZQ3qTKAKl-hKOIrj-848kk9Bl_CzzK7t_0WQHQJ7GYJSjU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1Kt5_lpIlj8fSmYCgR96rAYou-V28CXfvb78LjvIBOf6hLpCMQ-ZGneRlk18RznB0C8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cmT2c5lP1ziqdU4WQxzvOjAm1eGhLKbwsfLp2uKgPY0s8640P0k15ks30LsqMBjxEPw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VMfXX8VhmvJWgsKPJc5_C9WofbRSbxpNU9I9S1UQ9H44lwIkrlIZFFRK6FgiJRr5994""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Feb 29, 2016",1682323092000,"2.2.6","- Rome2Rio links can now be opened in the app.<br>- Fixed an issue where the app would not be able to connect to the internet.<br>- Added a very short feedback survey.<br><br>Love our app?

But it is too slow (it freezes), it does not connect the selected ""too see"" points that we customly add with those that we add from the recommended ones (they are not shown in the same place), and in an instant the option to add prices for certain museums and hotels disappeared. But due to freezing and slowness, I won't use it unless you fix it soon. The same thing happens on a computer and on a mobile phone. | The app keeps crashing, asking to delete the cache. | The app's really handy but poor performance kills the vibe. It becomes unusable | A good idea but the app freezes constantly (yes, I ensure it's the up to date version). Can't share itineraries with anyone because the app just closes. Any travel itineraries that are fairly large also don't even open most of the time. And a video version of the itinerary hasn't worked since downloading the app months ago. Will be downloading an alternative app instead. | Please improve the app, it constantly crashes. The potential is great with this app. | not intuitive at all. hard to navigate. Looks pretty but it feels like an unfinished project, to be honest. Needs to be updated asap. | love it already...only been using it for an hour! | Not finished really annoying. Accidentally added lagos in apparently Portugal from a point in Guatemala & there's no way to edit or delete it. Rather than say it's buggy or stupid just say, FINISH programming before you release an app, as it is it's garbage. 2.9 stars average says it all really. | Upon initial download this app appears as wonderful and super well thought out. But as previous reviews state, super glitchy and lacks basic functions...for example, once you have selected dates for a particular location, you cannot change them? Nobody has time to plan and plan again the same trip on the app. | nice app to plan, but very slow when adjusting route or plans | Very slow, but pretty cool | Fantastic app concept and layout. I would like to be able to edit budget details from the plan directly. The app crashes fairly often, which is the main reason I can't give it 5 stars. | Could be amazing. The design and functionality is great - pretty intuitive and practical. BUT it crashes constantly and is really laggy. I'm waiting for an update to fix it, then u think they'll have a really successful app. | Great App once you learn how to use it, but all my packing lists have disappeared and i can only see my trip if i am on the webpage - please help!!!! Thank you for helping - your service was amazing and i have all my info back!!! | Found it a bit slow to load/ move things around. Also could not figure out how to remove locations from the route. I'm trying some other apps instead | Lot of room for improvement. Lot of bugs and glitches. | very useful tool for planning | Laggy | Stop sending me emails make a setting to disable emails | I really like the concept of the app, however now it just doesnt work anymore. I planned a few trips already using stippl and overlooked the few bugs that were in the app, however, now it just crashes directly on startup everytime. I checked with others and they are experiencing the same. If you don't want people to leave this app I think it is important to fix this ASAP. Thanks | App structure is very good but happens to be full of bugs. It takes forever to edit your existing trip | As many say, I want to love it as it is a brilliant idea but buggy and slow. Maybe I'm missing something, but there isn't a way to add flights or transportation? Have a trip coming up that is 2 days of flights, trains and ferry's, and it would be great to be able to add them so my dates are correct. | Review | I can't press ""done"" because it's too high on my screen, overlapping with my upper bar with time and connection data. | The app won't let you change your ame, age, gender, etc. The profile option DOES NOT SAVE anything! | Interestingly worthy | This app was working well but now it won't save restaurants. You had a lot of potential but now it's just frustrating. | Could be brilliant but just so buggy and laggy. I've just updated the app now it fails to launch. | Can you only chose cities by name or can you chose locations / nights from the map as well (also for example mountains)? | Cumbersome to navigate around, some required buttons shown half off the screen. Delete your account button doesn't do anything (funny that). | A beautiful, clear app but still a work in progress. At present, there are too many annoying glitches. I'm looking for something to replace the spreadsheets I use to plan my holidays. This is the closest I have yet found but, sadly, it doesn't quite make it. | I want to love it but the occasional crashes, the laggy feeling when using the app and not sometimes struggling to add lodgings if they don't match certain search terms just ends up being a frustrating experience. Definitely think there's something there, the app just needs more love and maybe a native experience rather than hybrid. Alternative apps seem more solid and reliable. | Bad privacy! There's no option to delete my account. | This app is AMAZING! The best travel planning app I have ever used. Love it. It is a bit buggy/laggy but it does everything I'd ever want a travel planning app/travel logging to do, really really good! However, the choice of places to select could definitely be improved. Alicante airport, lots of tourist destinations (or towns near them) such as the Pulpi Geode and just general places cannot be selected, even when you can see the places named on the base map which is really limiting. | Would be so helpful but its so frustratingly laggy on my Samsung! | HONESTLY THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST APPS I HAVE EVER USED, I HOPE IT DOESN'T GO DOWNHILL FROM HERE, PLEASE KEEP IT LIKE THIS!!!! | Trying to open the app but it just keeps loading a blank white screen 😭 | After the update I can confirm I can now access the application as intended, thankyou for the quick turn around on the solution! | It's okay. A bit slow and glitchy at times. Doesn't always save changes. Also, when I add in overnight travel (and click the toggle for overnight travel) it doesn't account for it on the 'nights planned' total. So it says that I have only planned 64 out of my 69 nights planned because it doesn't add on those overnight travel sections. Although when you scroll through the travel plan it has accounted for them with the dates. Minor issue, but would be great if it was fixed! Like the app though 😊 | Would be better if you allowed dates to be put in out of order. I know the beginning and end of my upcoming trip but not the middle. I'd like to be able to plan from each end toward the middle rather than needing to enter details in chronological order. | Started to use App for trip to Taiwan but Taiwan is listed as a province of China-which it is not! Immediately uninstalled the app. Disgraceful. | Still crashes | Great potential but... Planning a trip across countries, i can find the places to add and then within seconds they are deleted from my itinerary (specifically North Macedonia) | Deletes cities I entered within seconds after adding them After selecting countries I will visit, the app is suggesting cities not in the selected countries. Additional remark: after contact with Stippl support it turns out to be a bug on my destinations. I also tried it on another trip and that worked perfectly. | Slowest app ever | The app keeps crashing down! | Took a bit of learning at the start. Pretty good app with clean interface and no ads. A bit slow sometimes but understandable with the amount of info getting put in. Would be great to have sgd option in the budget and timings for activities. | Worked for about an hour and now it crashes every time I try to open it. It's a shame, I was really enjoying it up to that point. | When it comes to layout and features the app is fantastic. Unfortunately it's not well optimized, and kinda of a slog to use. Hopefully future updates will improve overall snappiness. There are also a few bugs, like some proprieties not saving, which makes the experience a bit frustrating. But I think the potential is here, and if working properly I think it can be an almost pefect app | Very unresponsive. For something so simple that's totally unacceptable. | Very limited available currencies. Please add SGD. I won't be able to use it for now. I'll review again when SGD is added. Thanks! | For us too (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤(´ε｀ ) (*＾3＾)/～♡♥╣[-_-]╠♥ | I do not like this app at all! I can't even create an account without it crashing! I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. | Loved the app. Planned an upcoming trip in the UK. It was easy to organise our itinerary in one place, adding links to walks, restaurants and activities for the trip. Great app - loads of potential. | Had to create an account to try it out. Seems designed for an iPhone with the done button annoyingly in the top right. Also, it hasn't heard of Nelson in Canada, or let me add it so is useless for my next trip. | Very buggy. Won't allow you to scroll through travel options so you are forced into choosing by train rather than by car. Repeatedly has issues with adding accommodation coming up with something has gone wrong error messages. Adds costs to your trip automatically that are incorrect and that can't be deleted. | Great idea but, it has far more room to improve, full of bugs, to the point you want to give up, the app shuts down when I click on the +Km betweens journey. | A number One | Was excited to try this out for my upcoming Memorial Day trip, especially after it was recommended by Playstore Editors. Unfortunately it's still buggy as of 5/23. The worst thing is that the search function used to populate location entries in the trip isn't accurate or precise. For example, I can't enter Washington, Missouri, only Washington D.C. and I can't enter Finger Lakes suburbs, only larger cities. I think it'll be cool once some of the bugs are fixed. | I see how the app could maybe be good, but it's way too buggy to actually use. There's absolutely no locations for ""Korea South,"" you can't change currency from EUR to USD unless you change your units from kilometers to miles, and once your name is set--not your username, but your first and last name--you can't change it. I tried to make an account w/ Google Sign In but I never use my real name online, and it wouldn't let me change it. | All systems software Networking incorporated support | Full of bug Starting from date choosing | The description sounded interesting. I use Tripit to collate all my Travel details together so thought this was a step further expecting it to also give suggestions about the local areas I'm visiting. But, when trying it out... I don't really get it. Uninstalled after about 2 mins. Didn't really seem to work. Couldn't select locations or dates. Either it didn't work properly or its really not a great UX. Disappointed. | This is the traveling app I been looking for, can track all the attractions you planned to visit and itinerary, record all the expenses in the currency you prefer, and even can share with your friends. And the app is user friendly, and most importantly it is free | Dreadful experience in the app, watching a video from the creators, it looks like the web app is a better tool and this is something that you use to view the work you do in the web app. But I found this app not user friendly or easy to use to plan and trip or create a city break. I was planning a trip to Prague, I now have three Prague trips, with various things to see and do, none of it was created separately, but apparently that's what this app wanted to do... Think I'll find something else | This app does not work at all. Nothing loads... | Keeps crashing | Installed, but won't open ""because it has a bug. Clear cache and try again."" Still doesn't open. | Crashes | Truly great app for planning my holidays! | country search with case sensitive, really? As a developer, I can say this is very amateur. Login with Facebook did not work. Creating a trip was hanging for 1min. | Seems like an app with lots of potential. A quick browse through the app and I have a few suggestions. Make vibrations customisable, add itinerary schedule function, & add a function to the record and split expenses with collaborators.

Easy to add personalized things. I have the paid version. | Excellent app, it does the job as expected. | I paid for this app but it wouldn't allow me to add items to the packing list. Every time I tried, the app crashed and closed. I was never able to make my packing list with this app and I forgot to pack a few things! I'm not happy. | Very essential | Very user-friendly | Great app for any type of checklist! | I really like it | Great idea. The app won't allow me to select just 1 clothing item... it's zero items or more than 2... I deleted the app. | Easy to use | It is nice for a basic, single city trip. However, there is no way to create a single packing list for a multiple city trip that could include one place cold and rainy and another that's warm and sunny. I wish I could type in multiple destinations with there dates and come up with a unified list. | Can't add to list, app just closes | Why does the past packing list go away?? Why not let us decide to keep it or not. Also no option to select between male / female | How to add counters for customised items to specify the count? | I wouldn't buy it again. Too buggy. If you update template it doesn't update the trip. If you update trip there is no way to update template. There is no search options. If doesn't recognize the place it just picks whatever the app want to choose. | Make packing easier | Crashed every time I added an item but still really cool if their last is perfect. It's auto generated after filling out some questions. Really cool. Never mind, I changed to 5 stars. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which resolved my issue. It works great now | Helped me think of things that I hadn't thought of. | A nice app to help you organize your packing before a trip. Love how you can customize to fit your needs. | This was a godsend as I was packing for my trip. Because of this app, nothing was forgotten that I had to go out and purchase. I also used it again for my trip back home, so I was sure I didn't forget anything there. In the end, I am confident this could potentially be labeled as a money saver! I love this app!! | Covers all necessities | This is my favorite packing app... It is perfect 10 /10. | It's a life (and luggage space) saver | Can only use for 1 location. Very disappointed | Must try | So helpful with all the travel we do. This app really helps ease my packing anxiety! | Super easy and complete! And fun to use. | It's legit. I always struggle at the last minute to remember everything but this generates a check list for you in seconds | This app is very helpful. Since I travel with my dog, I would like to have a way to remind me what to pack for him. Other than that, it's a great app. | Very Nice And Helpful for Travelers, Easy to use | I used to love this app but it's no longer reliable. Items keep disappearing off the list for not reason, then you end up forgetting things. | Easy to use... | It is very helpful when it comes to packing but some things may be annoying to other like the sound effects. Overall i belive this is a good app | The edit and delete buttons overlay the quantity button and are very glitchy | I do really like this app, but honestly I'm only doing the review as the constant 'rate the app' pop ups are really annoying me 🥲😅 | Great app | So far so good! | Good app - best packing app I've been able to find. Please make it possible to rearrange the activities once they're in your list. ie. I prefer to have ""clothes"" at the top, then ""toiletries"" then ""electronics"" but it just places them in whatever order it wants. | Lack of support after purchasing the app. I had purchased this app on a different phone. When I installed it on a new phone the purchase didn't transfer. Tried contacting support several times without success. I switched to a different app. | Goood | Helpful app, haven't forgotten anything using this. | This app is definitely not as customisable as one would hope/expect in the paid version. | Great, easy to use app | Great app. Love it had location | Very thorough list | Easy to use. Very useful! | Really handy. Use for all trips. Just purcahsed the full version and custom lists are so useful. | Useful | Useless | Even after trying many times, adding stuff doesn't work. And when I delete things or mark them done, they come back! It's really annoying and makes using the app not uaeful at all. | Good covering all items | In App upgrade doesn't work. Money wasted. | It keeps deleting things I've added to my list. Maybe it's just me being a noobie. But the idea is not to forget anything. How can I do that if it deletes it without my knowledge. | An app that makes packing easy | Very cool | Very nice app | Used to love this app but now unusable due to bugs that prevent saving changes to templates. Only half the items added appear and some are randomly deleted from the template and from the trip packing list itself. | Easy to use Great prepopulated categories. Good price if you need to customize it | I've bought it but it doesn't work. When I add a new item on the list it shuts down. I would like to be refunded please. | Very helpful! | Very helpful I have a tendency to forget get all the stuff helps a lot | I really wanted to live this, even paid for the app. However, it does not save what new items I add to the list. ☹️ | Used to like it but a bug has made it unusable I was using this app often and found it very handy but recently I cannot add additional items to the lists because ever time I do the app crashes. This had made the app unusable for me which is disappointing. | Good guide for planning your trip | Kept removing things from my list on it's own | The free version at least is not customizable at all so it's kind of useless | Keeps crashing within a minute. Also lack of multi destination makes it very inefficient. I'll be asking for a reimbursement. | Superb | Very useful | Very useful for keeping track of what to pack | It has a lot of useful items and you can add your special items! Easy to use. | Great | Good app so far. | Easy to use, very thorough. | Good, does what it should even the free version | A good reminder | Very handy. Use it before every trip. Love that I can add custom items and change the order of the items in the pre-built lists (in the free version). I do wish I could change the order of the entire category lists. If I've chosen Working, it always appears as the first list even through I'd rather Essentials and Toiletries were first. | So helpful!!!! | Zero support! They never respond. Too bad. With a few improvements to editing as others have also asked for, this could be a nice 5 star app. | Helps you remember the little things. Used to pack things weeks before and list reminds you what you put in bag already | Nice app. Very helpful. Would be better if you could print the list. | Absolutely love this app. Easy to add new items (with premium) but only add them directly to the main list of you wish them to be temporary. If you want them to be permanent you can check on our off for present and future travel, scroll to the bottom to ""customize packing templates"" and add things there you permanently want on your packing lists. So smooth. I will use this app for years. Much better than my previous one and I love that you can customize for various types of travel. Perfect. ☺ | Best app for packing | Wonderful app. It helps you not forget anything when packing! | Essential for traveling | Limited editing options without upgrade. Items you add to the preset lists often disappear. | I love pack point I just wish I could add my own activites and customize my pack template 🤔🤷‍♀️ | Ready made lists for easy packing. No more oops, I forgot to pack... | Honestly this was just a waste of time. You have to buy premium just to add more dtuff as this is just ai generated. | Now they removed the swipe action so I can't remove the unnecessary items in the list, do I have to customise my list every time before the trip? That just don't make sense | Even after purchasing the app, no edits to the default lists will save. If you remove them to recreate them with your own items, the icons are not selectable (i.e. the toothbrush). There is no way to edit trip information if you make a mistake. Nor is there a way to edit a list item without deleting it and recreating it. | This is a wonderful app that helps me not forget things I need. I use it for every trip. | 🙂 | I like it very much | 👍good👍 | Please enable changing language in app | Good 👍 | I don't understand why this app has so many high reviews. I made a list for an upcoming trip and immidiately started noticing issues such as; when it automatically added the items to my list at the starts I would delete them since I didn't need over half of them, later on I would try to add them back on but it wouldn't let me since I ""Already had them in that category"" but I had deleted them before. I aslo still haven't been able to have more than one list at a time and it's so frustrating.","{""1"":1505,""2"":1027,""3"":1302,""4"":3906,""5"":32119}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$2.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Wawwo","Wawwo","info@packpnt.com","https://www.packpnt.com","8605 Santa Monica Blvd
