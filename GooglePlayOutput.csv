I'm at the beginner stage and it wants me to do almost 100 push-ups in one workout session. Ask me at the end how difficult it was. When I selected too hard and it make it a little easier. It makes the rest of the workouts easier. Which is not what I want. The rest of workouts then become too easy and I'm stuck raising it back up to a difficult level again. I'm not getting a good balanced workout from this. Extremely difficult on some days, then too easy on others."",""I'm using this to get back into shape so I can enlist, it allows you to choose how hard or difficult it will be, and even allowed me to choose if the tasks were too hard to do. It's helpful and the videos are also great for if you don't know how to do something. I also appreciate that you can add time to the breaks in case you still need a moment. Just a great app to me and I would recommend it to most. Adds are short and pop up less than most apps so it's also handy."",""Perfect except for one thing. Been using this app for a few months and the results have been amazing! Went from 137 lbs to about 150. Started nice and slow, because I could only do 2 push-ups at a time. Now I'm muuuch stronger and plan to keep going! The only thing I don't like is how the lower body 7x4 challenge doesn't have all the features of the total body 7x4 challenge. The total body has an option to adjust the workout both before you start and after you finish. No such thing for lower."",""The workouts are generally good and require little to no equipment. I only wish it offered a finer-grained way to tailor the workouts to my abilities (beyond just rating how hard an entire workout was). For example, in the beginner ab workout, I've always felt that the leg raises are 100x harder than all the other exercises combined. The app tells me how to make some exercises easier--just not the one that is actually too hard for me."",""After reading the reviews I saw the app was free with ads but after going through the set up process and answering questions to establish a plan, I dont even have the option of a free trial? It goes straight into a paid subscription. Not even presented with a free option. If I had a trail and liked it then I'm more likely to do a subscription but will look elsewhere now instead.""]";false;false;false;"homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment";"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment&hl=en&gl=us"

You try and open it, nothing loads and the app either crashes or you have to restart it 5 times. To watch any of the video content, regardless of if it's a 15 second clip or a 90 second clip, you have to watch a 30 second ad before it, and then the video you want to watch often doesn't load. And this is with me paying for an ESPN+ subscription. Worthless."",""I feel that after the last couple updates everything takes so long to load. Watching a video is the worst. Update: nothing has been fixed. Still horrible at loading content. At first I thought it might be my reception but even with wifi, pages and videos take forever to load. I don't have these issues with any other sports news apps. 5 years later... still horrible. Ads have no problem loading but when the video I actually want to see comes up, the video fails to load."",""They decided to make it so that you can not stop \""Breaking News\"" notifications unless you disable the \""All Notifications\"" category in the Android settings... which will also disable notifications for the start of games. The app will no longer honor its setting for turning off \""Breaking News\"" under \""Trending Alerts\"". Great going, ESPN...."",""The app issues pop-ups of items of interest for me, which is useful, but when I click on them, it goes to a never-ending LOADING screen, and one I back out of that, the story is lost. Please fix! In addition, it would be helpful to reinstate the refresh function inside of a gamecast. Currently have to back out to the main page, scroll to the top and swipe down, then scroll back down to the contest I'm following and re-enter."",""Follow up: Somehow it's gotten worse...constant loading wheel. Notifications that take you to the app and not the story you clicked on. So many ads on video, constant loading wheel Layout a bit clunky. If you take the time to pick favorites they should be easier to access.
