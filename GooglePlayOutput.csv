By loading your itinerary it gives a nice visual way of looking at your trip as well as modifying it, much like object oriented programming. There are are some issues like not properly showing how connecting flights between cities on a single PNR or locking up dark theme behind a paywall. I'm truly impressed that a founder personally responded to my feedback which bodes well for the future of this app! | basic features are free and very user intuitive. have been using it for all my trips now. the map feature is extremely useful and suggestions. | A nearly perfect tour planner. However, the interface could be a little snappier. | Used app to plan Iceland vacation. It worked great for planning and while in Iceland as we used it to help navigate to each stop. The ability to see the map and rearrange destinations was very helpful. It was very easy to use. I liked the ability to add notes. | The app is really great for having your travel plans together, especially since all the pertinent information is already available for places to visit, etc. | Wanderlog was amazing for planning my family trip to Japan. You can create and collaborate your entire trip using their mobile apps and the web app. I used the pro option to export everything to Google Maps which was really useful for planning days out. | i like ability to manage my own created itinerary. would like to see ability to search for restaurants and make reservations through the app. | it's a great app for those who love to travel | Such a great planner for our holiday! Loved the option to personalise costs for particular places. Not sure the pro version was worth it, the free option was pretty solid on its own. I would have liked pop-up reminders for events, but it was easy to get up to speed. A little slow at times. | I started using Wanderlog in 2023 to plan my Tokyo trip. From then on, I have not used any other trip planners. Wanderlog is easy to use and I like it that there are many fun recommended sights/places for the countries I travel to. I also love the Optimize Route feature as it helps me plan the itinerary more efficiently. In addition, the Customer Support was very prompt in answering my questions. Overall a great travel app! | Haven't used it for long but so far I am in love with the app, it has made it easier for my family to plan our trip and be able to all add things we would like to do and then organize everything | Free app optional to pay for extra service, easy to re-arrange the location with diff date, also can access it in web page too, happy with this app! | I am very pleased with the application. It serves my purpose well. I appreciate having everything in one convenient location. I can easily mark places I want to visit and view them on a map. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly. This application is an excellent tool for planning vacations. I have used it for my second vacation and will undoubtedly continue to use it in the future. | Would recommend! Very smart and convenient for planning the trip ahead | This app was great, allowed me to have all my travel plans in one place, very easy to use! | I love this app! Stay organized in one place! I used to use MS Word for all of the details but I love how Wanderlog automatically provides links and other info about all the places I have on my itinerary. I also like that I can make my own categories for other information. I'm using this app for four trips I'm in the process of planning and it's great. It's helpful for small trips of a couple days and two week long trips. | great tool for planning. organize evrerything in one place. Very flexible. easy to plan a road trip with many different stops. amazing amount of resources. | Well organized, easy to send info from my email confirmations, also updated expenses if included from reservations. Some interesting recommendations, easy to add places of interest to itinerary. Could be better in providing directions with options. | absolutely indispensable for trip planning! | Meh... Useless app with prev pay | Very useful to manage trips activities | Very convinient for planning a trip. It's quite laggy sometimes. Hope it will get better in the future. | easily captured all my trip details in one place! I could even refer back to the content that I forwarded if I had any doubts. | One the greatest tools ever for planning a trip. Ive used it on my 26 days trip to Japan and no other tool has been so usefull for planning and keep diary of all places we visit and wanted to visit! Its also incredibly easy to add things to your own planner from other peoples planners to easily build up your own Wanderlog 😉 | The perfect app for planning and organizing trips. | This app seems really cool but upon initial download, the amount of pop ups that show and redirects that the app does are incredibly distracting. I'll update the review as I use the app more however. | The idea is cool but the execution is poor. The loading time is long even though I have a pro account and offline access. In a good app this should mean loading and updating in background, but here is have to sit through seconds of loading on a high speed connection. Can't add regular transportation modes such as ferries to the planner. The auto-importer misses a lot and if you turn on Gmail auto-search it duplicates a lot. There are better products out there. | Great way to collect all your ideas for your trip then arrange them day by day. I really enjoy the map function to easily see where all your chosen attractions are located. | Useful app but lags a lot (I haven't seen this much lag in any other app) | A really useful app with a lot of options. Sadly it is pretty laggy on mobile and small things like swapping items on the itinerary from one day to another are error prone. The view on mobile can also get too cluttered, especially if you plan long trips with multiple stops. Also, it's sad that you can only purchase a yearly subscription to get premium features. Monthly subscriptions make way more sense for this type of app | great resource for planning | very helpful in planning a trip to a new place. It helps map your itinerary and shows many little things that help you complete your trip without thinking you missed something special. | I searched for a free app. This is not free. | I just found THE app for travelling! Amazing one-stop platform to put everything together, from flight details to lodging to places of interest... BONUS stuff: able to create notes, share with co-creaters, best routes, recommended places to go for dine and play... Thank you Wanderlog team for creating this awesome app! 😁 | The premise of the app is great and it has a lot of great features, but lately it has been extremely glitchy, for example the ""add"" button for new places to visit doesn't work for some sites no matter how much I press it, also the loading time is really frustrating. Today I made a new travel plan and painstakingly added more than 30 places to visit, only to find a few minutes later that the trip was nowhere to be found on my account :(( | I started planning a two week international trip with this app, so easy and intuitive. I love it and have recommended to friends who travel | awesome | This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used. it's just so well thought out. I am putting this at the top of the list of my favourite app. The web app is even better! | Really helpful to have all your travel information in one place! The explore page is great for inspiration and ideas. The interface can look a bit cluttered but once you familiarise yourself with it, it's really simple to use | I really love how this app organizes all your details. Especially love the feature where you email your reservations, and it plugs it into your iteniary! I attached screenshot of park passes, entered addresses, and it offers up other places to go and see. With a family of 7, I have to stay on top of every detail and reservation: Wanderlog makes that so easy! | I love this app! It's so easy to use, all your trip details in one place, easy to edit & manage agendas. It also opens the door to experiences you may have missed or overlooked by showing other points of interest, restaurants & experiences. I think they have covered everything you want to keep track of, all in one place! | excellent travel planner app | I stumbled on wanderlog a while ago and saw an amazing opportunity to use it for my trip to Korea. It was really easy to use, the interface was good. For me the best feature is the ability to have a map that shows the distance from one place to another. All in all I will definitely use this app again. So amazingly easy to plan for a trip. | Good idea and app but you will get tons of ""ads"" for hotel etc. But the Pro price is exactly what's wrong with todays subscription model. It's a travel app and the only option is to pay for a whole year, and it cost almost €60 (!). I also get a more expensive price in the app when i'm logged in than what their website say (€50). €60/year for Pro that most people will use for offline mode and attachments is crazy. Better to pay for e-sim. | La mejor aplicación para planificar viajes nacionales e internacionales. | I used the free version to plan my upcoming 1 month solo trip for Europe. Is a very good app which help me plan my itinerary easily and handy!! I even introduce my sister to use this app and she love it. | This app is not free, it is $50 per year after they collect data. I don't mind paying for an app, but don't lie. | awesome app! just what I was looking to plan our trips. full feature and very easy to use. | I have been the designated trip planner for our friend group for almost 10 years now. I have used apps like Tripit, Google Travel, splitwise, Citymapper, you name it! Once I found Wanderlog, I deleted all other apps. Wanderlog is all these apps combined into one!! And it's virtually glitch free. We recently took a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. Planning and executing has been a breeze. The developers have thought about every possible scenario. Budget summary could use some fine tuning. | Amazing app with all the features I need for planning trips. I shared with my family, friends, and today with coworkers. Looking forward to improvements as this app progresses. | absolutely love this app, I use it to keep track of places and things I want to see and also use it to log my trip as a trav journal! | Nica app. But it has many functionalities missing from the free version . | Fabulous app that has been so valuable in coordinating our trip. Everything you need is right here! AAA+ | Great tool to help plan and navigate our trips | Good functionality but I find the constant 'helpful' popup tips very grating. I think they are a good idea but the fact that it forcibly changes what's displayed on the screen and drags you away from what you were trying to do is too intrusive and instead of reading then I've just been clicking them away - hopefully I'm almost through them all now. Also maybe a personal preference but I find the text and interface a bit too zoomed in/not dense enough, maybe there could be a setting for this? | Great app for travel planning. Has the ability to add places, notes, etc. A great all round travel app | LOVE being able to share the trip itinerary with others. LOVE being able to easily re-arrange the things I've selected to do. LOVE multiple sources to find best of the best w regard to dining, etc., Can't wait to try it LIVE!! | this is a great system and can even quickly start navigation in rental cars. | really like this app. helped with planning | Excellent app, has made it possible for me to plan complex trips overseas and keep organized | I organised my Kyoto trip with the help of Wanderlog. I had an amazing good time. Now I am planning my next trip in July. Thank u Wanderlog. | I moved to Wanderlog from TripIt because of the clean, modern interface of the application and the website. I also like the map feature where it plotted on the map all you lodgings. Customer service was responsive and fast. Overall this great apps helped me on my 5 weeks trip to South America with many flights, hotels, car rentals and activities.AI integration looks promising as well. | Really good app very helpful to be notified when places will be closed | I love this app! It made trip planning so much easier to have everything in one spot, and so intuitively. Very user friendly and helped by allowing me to research options and have them pulled up in advance | Great Planning Tool | User unfriendly. Can't search within trip. Useless. If I could give less stars, I would. | this app has been amazing for planning my trips. absolute life saver so easy to use | Just used Wanderlog to plan my vacation and it was fantastic! Highly recommend giving it a try. | Amazing tool to plan and organize your trip. Saves a ton of time. There's a lot of room for improvement, but what they've got is worth 5 stars for how useful it's been. | Very good for travel planning. Easy to use. | I love the ability to organize to the level available even in the free version. Looking forward to what features and functionality are available in the paid version. | Powerful organizer for travel plans. | After much researching, I decided to give Wanderlog a go and it was pretty neat. A lot of things can be synced by forwarding hotel and flight emails, adding the cost of individual places / activities / food, adding links etc. The itinerary makes the trip easy to navigate, way better than Spreadsheet 🤭 So, thanks Peter Xu! For creating this wonderful app. I've started using for my next trip with my girlfriends :) | Very good apps for travel. My whole trips is plan well because got the Wonderlog, very helpful. | Great travel planning app with new features added regularly. | brilliant, everything is in one place, I love it | I have used Wonderlog for many of my trips. | The app keeps crashing on some places of the map view. I thought it was depending on the number of places I had added but then I realized this was not the cause. I also found quite annoying to add notes in the Itinerary view. Considering this is a touristic app, you should add other payment ways to buy the subscription as I tried to do it from the Google Play Store and because their country limitations I wasn't able to do it. | Too many pop ups, even after disabling tips. Would be nice to have a calendar view of itinerary as well as a download to excel or pdf function. | so far, to help on planning it has been helpful. it aggregates the info from my mails | a great app to consolidate travel details into a single itinerary. It's especially handy when you use multiple platforms to book flights, accommodation, tours and train/car travel as it's easy to check that booking dates are correct. | Not for me too nosy and seems to want to take over I installed Thanks | good and nice | I've only used it for a few days, but so far everything works great! It's great to be able to gather all the details of a trip in one place instead of searching email and texts and saved documents. | Great features | I love this app! I'm that person who is the planner of the group and always has a Google Sheet. I LOVE the organization/the mapping functionality of this app & the ability to have different ""layers"" of the map so I can see locations for different days or purposes (a map showing me everything I want to do! or a map showing me all the restaurants I'm considering! So helpful). Also love emailing the app to auto populate hotel reservations and train/flight reservations onto the itinerary!! | While not perfect, this is the best travel app I've tried so far. Great way to organize my itinerary, get directions, see suggested stops, and more. I'll keep using it! | Best travel planning app ever. | Very good App. Useful when you want for city break's with many things to, like Paris | love this app, planning a trip to Hawaii, this was a great help to keep track of everyone's tickets and itinerary. Bravo! | Extremely helpful. It's now one of my favorite apps. We just got back from a four day weekend, and it was fantastic to have all the information in one place. No more searching through email and texts to find information about your next stop. Directions are ready with just one click. We are planning a longer vacation in August. As I make reservations or book flights, I just forward the email to the app. The info will be right there when I need it. Great for detailed planners and for casual trips. | Would've been a great travel planning app, but I had lists just disappear without any explanation and have to remake them again. Will reach out if it happens again. | UPDATE: Plus one star for responding and at least attempting to fix the issue. Pro version still very expensive and a poor value, especially when their system burps at inconvenient times. Garbage app. Made the mistake of purchasing Pro. It won't automatically add vrbo's or other similar bookings and won't let you forward emails or enter bookings manually either. TripIt here I come. | wonderful tool, forever evolving, like travel itself, to make it easier, more intuitive and indespensible. | UNINSTALLING - Was given the impression that this app was free compared to competitor apps that are ""overpriced annual subscriptions"". This also has an annual subscription price, which is required in order to do anything in the app beyond the 7 day trial. $70 for an app to plan a budget friendly road trip... talk about ironic. | AI is fairly accurate and the recommendations are legit. I hope to see more exclusive deals to justify the subscription. | Best App for Traveling | organizing my trip in a couple of weeks and I'm already in love. THIS is exactly what I needed to sort out distance, opening hours and other things that would stress me out if I didn't have the details all laid out in a concise, neat way. | Offline access behind a paywall? LOL. Thats a new one. That means there's no acceptable free version as many trips you can end up with poor or no connectivity.","{""1"":623,""2"":295,""3"":57,""4"":653,""5"":12342}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.99 - $79.99 per item","8.0","8.0","VARY","Wanderlog","Wanderlog","support@wanderlog.com","https://wanderlog.com",,"https://wanderlog.com/privacy","Wanderlog","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UPCPofy2GzRCOSvrJh1Vf03KJ-yoZlzPn9F8X3wmZ3Q8Ja2cFSgMVTW9RzISEKLJ9us","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zw-QaVlEkLAdX77kgmoIbIZJCrZO3AEuzG998pehnsGBLiwluHMaej5UEgyVnvRquP4","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s4ov2KdTRKPFNmW8uqzvS9aHB2hAg93KzUEL2rJ1blL1Sdgli6OzouOIn_0fH8N2yiw9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hv0ww5ird-jcav8NYs9G4U7g9vfShOGH_V0qvplERqNIlapGqO2wvnMYtUf8Bl4Byg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SfJKx8Xp1VEHUxOkNDTFBsY7F1ROEsCJ5PM683e5NRdvaFWpKTxnhOTXQ9RTW2IgVPU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bHi0phpXB0Gv8S8dfDRPUJcAdj5yKa1Vr3m4Y3C2kIagGmKMydHiRBFHmXr2rNYOVS84"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mHJtRJgsG3ti-BJltQ2zoTOn0GUaRCC9bfYY4fCr8hfKShLH3VfE4QXy2F0465hubePU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0lybPwdP2xX6zvxFhgwJ-qq40Ycgpi0Yu5IIkQXijt0d0G91vizFsJAQgxRSzugXHw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TCTXPzxqld4owbTWUDybBVUWSXmNmFmKOFViubFKC-Eo5I6u-8AzE40oXcsIHjO0LcI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FUqSOBXt2XMMt-DjCX-2Fw9JEiCiLDdd0Qe9kY4ljczevM01v5OrvsuFlr4Lg-uoOHBK""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Aug 21, 2019",1712822618000,"2.123","Wanderlog&#39;s available in more languages!

All reservations pertaining to a trip in one place. | Couldn't create an account. It said the password I was entering to create a brand new account didn't match their records. Password requirements were vague as well. | i love it better with upgrade this time as the tickets and hotels, and activities automatically links with Trip It app. very handy | Helpful and easy to use by review of reservation and booking mails. Personalization of design could be improved | so far so good | I dont see any benefit to pro. It seems a lot to pay just for flight notifications. We already get that from the airline. I would like to be able to add more than 3 photos/pdf so that everything is in one place. It's a little archaic not to. Also, it's a trip planner, add a packing list. Again, so it's all in one place. This is my 1st time using this app and I'm travelling in 11 days. I'll edit when I return! | ""Error: saving failed. Please try again"". CONSTANTLY. Duplicating plans to different trips changes the trips' dates automatically, even after editing the duplicated plan to reflect new dates. Mass-editing still not possible after a decade plus. Amateurish effort and a childish attempt by intuit to hoover data. | Paid for the Pro which has some benefits like adding travel documents and updated gate alerts, but whenever my airline sends me updated flight times (which seems to be frequent) , it adds the updated flight as a new flight and then I don't know which leg of each trip is the new or old and I have to delete the whole trip and start new. Very frustrating. Updated to add it used to be better at forwarding emails and automatically inputting information. Half the time they go to unfiled documents now | Great way to organize a trip with multiple people planning, numerous hotels and stops, and flying more than one airline. | great app for planning | If you travel for business or pleasure, this would be a very useful addition. It take organizing to a new level. | soooo handy, highly recommended | Excellent travel companion. The stuff you need, in a simple presentation, and that's it. | fab app to get all your travel plans organised and in one place | Awesome | Perfect for long trips, especially when a lot can change 🙂. | A great place to hold all the details of your trip. | I've been using this app for 13 years and I find it to be one of the most useful apps on my phone. I'm planning another trip and Tripit correctly and safely stores my itinerary. Love it. | Super helpful and easy to use. Everything in one place, straight from your mails, no need to do much. | so easy to use and a great, clear itinerary display | very good tool to manage trips and hwt regular updates | trip it keep all the travel and hotels together. Very practical. | Tripit Pro is the best way to get organized and then stay dynamically organized as your trip progresses. | I have used TripIt for multiple trips, and I appreciate how it keeps us on track with our schedule. I also like that I can share the itenary with others. I would, however, like to see both a start and end time on the main page. | it's a great traveling tool. | Fun to track it all. | Doesn't connect to email like it used to. Harder to use. Used to so smooth and seemless, not anymore. | I love having all of my reservations in one place with addresses, reservation numbers, contact info and anything I could need while traveling. I can also share the itinerary with people that are traveling with me. | Have used and loved it for years. In 2024 the airport maps no longer display but give an error message saying there is a bug. Very inconvenient. Deducted a star. | great app!!! very useful to organize your trip!!!!! | For hotels during the trip, the timeline view only shows the start and end day of the accommodation. We need to show our colleagues ""where to stay"" each day after a busy day full of events. This was requested since 2016 and still not considered in a so called ""trip planner"" app. Any project planner like MS planner, Trello can easily duplicate the element and distribute them on each day as a column. Optionally, a packing list should be made available as a trip planner | Very useful information in one place. | great app | Useless, unless you pay for a subscription | Does the basics and allows to better organize a trip for easier visualisation, but could use some improvements. - Interface is OK but not great. It can be a bit confusing to use at first. - Does not allow to share trips with friends for reasons unclear that even support can't say. - I considered the pro version but I can't really understand what the benefits are apart from flight notifications, which I already get with my airline app for free. | Excellent app | Won't sync with outlook | Great, except the incorrect time display | Unable to create account. Keep getting ""use a strong password"" message when my password is 14 characters long with upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Frustrating. | Love how it organises everything for you. | I use Tripit for ongoing and complex trips lasting 6 months and more. It is a really good tool for identifying errors in my booking process. | it keeps surprising with features that pop up that I really appreciate | loving the simplicity and organization | so helpful | Can't connect to travel partners. Entering account information for car rental accounts, hotel accounts, and airline miles accounts is useless. TripIt doesn't effectively sync with any of them to pull current rewards information. | only with limited photos to upload | Really great way to keep all dates and bookings in one place and to share with multiple group members. | This app is awesome! It keeps all of my itinerary in one place. It even gives a safety score for where you're staying. Perfect job | Regularly logs you out and hangs when doing offline syncing so had to uninstall it as of March 2024 | Where has this been all my life??? | just downloaded. just what I was looking for | Invaluable tool for any traveler. | wowwwww, its a powerful tool 😎 | The app will not let me sign in. It's tells me my password isn't valid. But I can log in on a browser with that password so clearly it is the right password. This is insane. | I have been using for years. very convenient to have your flights, hotels, trips etc all in one place. | The best travel management app I've ever used had only one issue (processing non English bookings). Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred... What if this happened during trip? Useless app.... Uninstalled... Resolved previous issues. Apparently my device was updating apps at the time and a glitch occurred when I tried to log in to TripIt. After updates completed, I was able to change my password and update my trip information. Apologies to team TripIt. | Amazing app | I love how it creates your trip schedule so easily! | easy to organize complete trips | Great app to plan your trip. Gets updated from your email confirmations automatically so you have all your trip info in one place | Love how helpful status updates are! Best travel planner! | will let know once | great way to keep all of your travel information in one place. | awesome travel organizer | I think this is a scam it asks you for your date of birth and where U live straight away and it barely made any plans for me I had to do it myself and you have too pay $80 a year | I really love having this app. It helped me plan my recent trip to Canada. I haven't had to pay anything to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly.

If planning a summer trip during winter months. Winter closers will led to poor decision making because winter closers are used during summer planning. Also needs a daily distance calculation on the map to figure how far you can go on a day run. Have to use Google maps to check runs and figure distances. Won't renew because it can't be trusted. | Plenty of benefits to use on this app, highly recommend the premium version. | I installed, then checked restaurants around my local area only to find the list to be way outdated with many on the list closed down years ago. I can't rely on an app that doesn't keep its info up to date and relevant, so I immediately uninstalled it. | Do not waste your money on the worthless app it does nothing that Google maps doesn't do except it sucks and cannot even find state parks | Greed. I paid $36 back in February 2024 and I opened up the app and discover I no longer have access to almost all my planned trips. They require I spend even more money to unlock them. So to get everything I had for like the past three years again I need to pay $60. I just use Google and PowerPoint to plan my trips. Very disappointed. | Great planning guides with accurate and safe routes for our camper | Bought the upgrade but can't even sign into the app. No pop up telling me the issue - just a blip then nothing. | Was a good app till they changed the payment system I had trips loaded they are now all of a sudden locked and now they tell me I have to pay more money to access those trips | This app has helped me easily plan car trips to see family without having to cross between numerous other applications. They've integrated so much into one that it's a breeze for me to map out a plan with overnight stays. | Love the app but asking way too much money. A pro membership is middle of the road, only gets you 5 trips, and is $50 a year. The basic option gets you nothing. Hate that apps are so greedy. Apparently being a loyal customer for years means nothing. Absolutely ridiculous. Not only are you asking for more money but you blocked my access to trips I already have planned. | Use this because I have the Campendium package. I use it for planning only, still do Google for each days run. Like being able to look up attractions along our route. | Terrible app, don't waste your money. I have the premium version and it's utterly worthless. The route optimization is completely broken, causing the route to double back hundreds of miles to certain stops, literally take you in circles when you could reach each of the destinations in a fraction of the time, and no amount of manual rearranging fixes it. I wasted hours adjusting everything and eventually gave up. I have no idea how they charge to use the app. It can't do the one thing it should. | Couldn't do anything without making an account. | I did not enjoy this at all. App demanded I sign up, so I did, I tried to look at two things and it said I needed to upgrade. Tried to delete account, followed their support doc, can't delete account. Thanks for the headache. Would not recommend to anyone with a human body or brain. | Trash app. Useless | Helpful ideas! | Doesnt work. What a waste of time | You need to pay for an expensive year long membership to plan anything with more than two stops | Used to be a 5 star app but they've moved eveything that made the app functional behind a paywall. You can no longer see your old trips and can only add 1 stop now. The paid version is also worse than it used to be. Waypoints have gone from 150 to 20 for basic or 50 for pro and you only get 3 saved trips (less than the old free version). The map used to filter well but is now clogged with unrelated adds(ex. Hotels show up when you are looking for sites or attractions) | I found the desktop experience really helpful to plan a roadtrip we took. It provided some really interesting things to see along the way. The reason for the 3 stars, however, is the desktop UI could be better. As well, the app version, at least for Android, is really not useful I've found. Despite downloading the maps, it complained about lack of internet connection and so we had to rely on Google Map downloads. | Awesome app! easy to use. Has a lot of excellent features. | Please add dump station search! | Great app. Very useful. I love the map. Easy to plan out a road trip. Not confusing to use. Good information 👍 | I haven't used it yet, however I like that it keeps track of the height of the vehicle. I'm assuming it will show diesel stations, however it would be nice to differentiate diesel #2, B20, and Renewable 99%. Our manufacturer says avoid B20 and never R99. | Used to let you do a few pins on the map now it's fewer with free. Almost non existent. I don't travel enough to pay for the app/site. | Still needs work. I don't like the inability of the map point automatically to center on the camp I select on the left panel. | So I put hours of my time in to planning a trip this spring only to have them lock my trip because they changed the tiers. They locked the one single trip I was actively working on and want me to pay even more to get access to it. I have all my reservation numbers and notes in this app. Sketchy af and they won't be getting any more of my money. Way to screw over your customers, roadtrippers! | This app sucks n it's very hard to use | I like the service but the app keeps crashing and since unusable. I guess I'll have to cancel during my free trial. Darn | Live the mapping and all of the sights that are not on everyone's radar | Wouldn't let me create an account | Crashes on road | Dated interface. There's no apparent curation of opportunities that are suggested for your roadtrip. Expensive subscription still comes with ads, no premium features, and a limit of 3 plans and 20 stops. My request for a refund or prorated cancellation was denied. | Invaluable summer of 2021 - 8 day 2500 mile trip beautifully planned and organized in advance, changed in real time with Roadtrippers. Things wewe so familiar - because I'd already been there many times - virtually. My perfect tool! 2024 update - Upgraded. WORTH IT! DO IT! App is priceless now. When you search for locations, you may need to try slightly different search before it finds it - minor inconvenience | At first, a reasonable number of trips/stops were free minus advanced features. Then that limit was trapped behind the subscription, locking you out of trips you had already made. Then that subscription costs more _and_ gets more limited, so you have to pay for the next tier just to maintain what you've had. ""Free"" accounts are not really useable now (1 destination with 1 stop). And more and more POI are out of date or just have incorrect locations. Avoid this service. | Would really like to subscribe but current version will not let me. | Can't do anything without an account. Useless. | This is my go-to before leaving for trips! | Can't get it to work | I cancelled prior to my free trial being over and yet I was still charged a ridiculous expensive fee for what this app is. I emailed customer support and was told I was now the proud owner of a year long premium subscription that I don't want and there is nothing that can be done ""per contract"". If you're looking for a travel app stick to Google maps or go to Wanderlog. A lot cheaper and not sketchy. | Total scam, Google and tripadvisor are free and do more than this does without a ripoff double digit subscription | So easy to plan routes, see what's worth visiting and check out accommodation. Excellent app for long road trips. | I will not be making my trip until late to the end of April. Should I sign out? Don't want any trouble or problems ✌️ Thank you | I don't spend much time online. So when I downloaded this app and logged in using Facebook and my Facebook was mysteriously hacked the next day.. kind of makes me think the 2 things are related. Also there was a major pay wall to using the app FYI | 👍 app for information | A promising app which is not yet ready for prime time. | Travelling made easier with all the options this app offers. | So far so good. | Would like to unsubsidized from this app but there is no way to do so and our card was just charged for another year. Stop | Useless in Europe. I am at a very busy tourist area but the app shows no shops, restorans or hotels. When I tried to find a grocery by name the app shows only list of US located stores. The app has permission to access my location but it doesn't help | Still no Android Auto support! It is to bad as that would make this a world class app. | Would not let me create log in. | Need paid subscription to do anything other than one location. Why not just use Google maps at that point which is free. | Z×foot 4knu, | I bought the $36 plan, planned a trip, and saved it for when the time comes to officially plan out the trip. NOW, it's saying I have used up my basic plan and won't allow me to review, or edit the trip I started. SCAM! | Love it! | I had a subscription a year ago. Didn't renew because of poor maps. Got a notice that Roadtrippers was updated and better. Don't know what the updates were, but it doesn't matter because of the poor maps. I will be canceling again. If you ever improve your maps, I will come back. Make a map like the old Rand McNally paper maps and I will be back. Your maps have poor contrast between the map background and roads. When I zoom out, seconbary state roads and major county roads dissappear. | I am trying to plan a 2 week road trip around California. There is an area around Big Sur on hwy 1 that is 1.9 miles between parks, both of which are on Hwy1. The app and the desk top are both diverting me and making this a 5 hour trip. It is right in the middle of my trip up the coast making it very hard to accurately plan out. May have to cancel this subscription and find a different app. Overall the app seems user friendly, but, clearly not accurate. I hope they can resolve this issue. | I do a lot of road trips, and this app is great for planning. It will arrange stops in a logical way, but it will also allow me to move them if desired. I love the feature that lets you see the stops on a map, so I can see if a stop is too far of my desired trip route. The app can also give great suggestions for whatever your favorite thing to see on your travels is. I wish it included more hiking trailheads, but I can typically get somewhat close to where I want to go. | Love the way it pops a new waypoint into where it should be along your trip & that you can put in dates. | Campendium is shutting down and we are forced to use this app? It's worthless. No links to the blm sites, no cell coverage information, no reviews at all. | We are taking the kids and my mom on a multi destination vacation out west. I had the route mapped out. Thenstarted looking for all those cheesey touristy quick roadside attraction and photo ops. I was having a very difficult time finding them and then adding them in the right order. We got the pro package. My wife and I can now look and plan things together, and the app pin points them in the right order on our trip! It's a great tool! | Terrible trip planning. Impossible to do everything I thought I signed up for. | Gps kept thinking we were on roads we were not and it just stopped routing when I change routes. | Edit: A good company trying to make the best trip app possible. Not my favorite but you can count on them to resolve problems! | Google maps works much better. This app is severely lacking. | I cannot believe that after paying 39.99 for years I suddenly went to login and was told I need to pay even more to now have access to all of my saved trips and it won't even let me choose which of the three trips I'm now limited to seeing and the ones I need now are locked! The only way to get access to them is to pay more or delete all of the other trips I have planned/put hard work into! Shame on them!! | Great app/service to help us plan road trips, getaways, and vacations. Highly recommend | Fun and Easy to use. | They killed this app. You can't even make a trip anymore without having a paid subscription. Used to be six or seven free waypoints when making a trip, now it's three. What a joke. | Great app for planning adventures | Almost impossible to cancel premium subscription. I have never used this service and they have been charging me for multiple years. App hangs when I click on manage subscription to try to cancel and nobody responds to customer service messages. Beware. | Not android friendly and difficult to cancel membership | Great for RV or car travel. | Doesn't have Thailand in it | $49 a year....don't waste your money! | Even with my subscription that allows 3 trips, I can't access a previous trip. There should also be a setting to prevent the app from changing dates or moving stops around. | I have to pay money to avoid highways on your app are you serious, I only own small displacement motorcycles going on the highway is literally impossible for me lol I hate capitalism with a fiery passion. | App is just okay the problem is when they auto renew your subscription with no notice and even if you try to cancel it on the same day they basically tell you too bad and charge you anyway, but hey, you can still use it. | I downloaded the app and that was the only thing that went right. You can't change the path unless you add a useless waypoint to point you in another direction. You can't add dates to specific waypoints. There is no summary sheet of any of the data you enter on each waypoint and on and on. I wasted 4 hours and he ave deleted the app and WILL NEVER try to use it again. Worst program I've ever encountered in all of my days since cell phones came out! | toooo expensive and I still have to use Google Maps. | Suddenly you go from having a free option, to asking for a minimum $40/mo... which is absolutely insane. | I have used Roadtrippers many times in the past with great success. Changes to the app have made it so much more difficult to use. I keep adding things to my trip on certain days and when I move things the app will shift things to the wrong day. We rent houses so I keep the house address at the end of every day since that is where we return to. The app keeps trying to group the house listings together. Once I put something on a day, it should stay there. | No no no | I had the absolute worst customer service from this company that I've ever had. She was rude, unreasonable, and sending irrelevant ""help"" to my issue by just copying and posting FAQs or giving irrelevant answers. I think I've only had five companies this bad in my lifetime and this goes down as one of the worst of those 5. | I had the TOGO RV app that gave me RV driving time as opposed to car driving time. Since TOGO was no longer available, I received a link to Roadtrippers which doesn't have this feature. It's also very difficult to navigate. | Disappointed. Just doesn't do what it advertises. Canceling free trial subscription. Worse than being a poorly designed app, the interface flaws cause me anger. | I have had a subscription for 5 years or so. We haven't used the app much, but I kept the subscription ""just in case."" This year we are planning a couple of big road trips and thought we would finally use the service we've been paying for all this time. I had started putting together itineraries and getting plans together. Last night I found that my $35 subscription gets me almost nothing and I wasn't informed that it was changing 🤬. I can't access my saved trips from my phone. | Not going to pay 50 bucks for a map. App makers have gotten greedy. 5.00 a month I'd have been All in but not paying a tank of fuel for what I can do myself with a cheap map. Free version includes 3 stops, a 2000 mile trip requires 5 or 6 fuel stops alone not even including motels and rest stops. No monthly option, no thanks! | It's good glad to have it | Amazing tool for Trip planning. I have used it for probably 20 road trips. I like to add many places to visit, and then just switch them off if we aren't in the mood. Keeps a good record of the places we have been. Premium version is well worth the expense. | Not working | I was so disappointed with the new interface. I used the free version of this app in the past and loved finding things along my route to visit while seeing some targeted ads. Most of the features I loved are gone. The current free version is SO hard to even navigate around, I'm just removing the app. I would buy guides for vacations but can't justify a subscription, especially with as bad as it is to use. Sad to see a good product ""improved"" to the point of uselessness. | Edit* deleted the app because it would no longer let me pull it up on the browser. It auto opened the app. Once deleted I could use it on browser again.* After using this for a while: I LOVE roadtripper.... but I'm not a big fan of the app. It's much easier to use on desktop. But since the accounts connect you can do research and set everything up on desktop but have the trip easy to pull up at a moments notice via the app so still worth while. If you're having trouble use it on desktop :) | Subscribed to premium program not easy program to add things to...dates, plan stops prior leaving on trip. I don't think program is worth the $$ Goggle maps is about the same and it is free. | Seemed like user friendly platform, price is way too much for what it is. | Tried it for a bit, but there are too many things behind a paywall (that are free in other apps), and the fee is over $80/year CAD for premium and over $65/year CAD for the cheaper Pro Tier. Basic tier lacks too many features to be useful for me. | Crashes whenever you try to navigate. Product is full of advertisements which is not acceptable for a paid app. Application keeps popping up messages to renew or give a gift to a friend. Product does not include a calendar which is kind of useless considering it's supposed to be a trip planner!","{""1"":2159,""2"":508,""3"":334,""4"":951,""5"":4116}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$6.99 - $59.99 per item","10","10","VARY","Roadtrippers","Roadtrippers","support@roadtrippers.com","https://roadtrippers.com","131 E McMicken Ave

Hopefully, they will fix it | I use this app ALL THE TIME! I love it! It helps me explore places, find the best things to do, places to stay and good eats. I can make reservations through the app and message the venues to make sure things are still available. It's user-friendly and I can make decisions based on reviews. It saves time and money when you're in new places. Don't leave home without it. | Pretty good but missing features... Can't rate individual food atmosphere service like you can on the website and also I haven't been able to figure out how to add specific caption to the photos uploaded. | Food is always great, ambience perfect, good venue for private functions. Located at heart of Westland, Nairobi. Nice terrace view... | Just garbage! Tried to search for things to do in Vegas, app literally closed; twice! I cleared cache, and it did it a third time. | Good app for information | Love the app. Going places is now less of a gamble, and you get the opportunity to say a ""well done"", when a place earned it, and to give your feedback to a place when they could improve. I'm sure some businesses will have benefitted greatly from the app. | Use it a lot, especially for restaurants | Amazing | Must have per I viaggiatori | Easy to use and great for information | Excellent as a reference for your trip. | The app is to specific in the end questions and not flexible enough in reviews | Am happy | Love trip advisor. Still loving the app 6 years after I posted the first review. | Good | When we do good things, our life will be more better | Good well been | Used to be good but now negative reviews are allowed to be deleted by the owner so you get to many positive reviews | Good experience | Great to use and good to refer to when deciding on whether one should use a certain service | I have used and love TripAdvisor for many years. One of the best websites to use when traveling!!! | September 12 2023...unstable...cuts out when scrolling | Very good | I never go anywhere new without consulting TripAdvisor | Easy to use and navigate | I love travel | Great for viewing places you are interested in or finding new places to explore | Good App | So easy to complete a review and upload photos | Updated the app. Really wish I hadn't. My Trips have been ruined. I was quite happy planning my trips by days. Who the hell knows what day e.g 18th June is without looking at a calender! | Everything great so far, I may increase rating as as king within the first 5 minutes of opening the app doesn't allow for much user experience | Easy to complete. | Does everything it should and also well. I also enjoy the layout and never had any problems | Wonderful hotel | Lots of options. Details of tours, locations, attractions. Many you can book with TripAdvisor but info is still available otherwise. Reviews are so beneficial and easier to filter. Highly, revommend using. | Easy to use 👍 | Good customer service | Excellent app for tours all over the world 🌎 | Genuine reviews which help decide your trips and hotels.

Excellent breakfast. | Very helpful in finding fun things to do | Very helpful and good for advice | Good | Great app | Nic | TripAdvisor is my trusted go-to app when traveling or planning travel. The customer reviews of restaurants and activities are a trusted resource. | I've discovered it's freezes at different places. Sometimes using the A.I, Sometimes not. Doing regular searching | I do not know how I managed before I started using TripAdvisor | This app is so good | The app refuses to go online. Despite every other app working and my internet being fine. Have tried reinstalling it a bunch of times and this has been a problem for months. | Excellent and easy to use. | Why is all the prices coming up pound instead of us dollars. Everything looks interesting but I can't book cause I don't know the correct price | The app is intuitive and easy to navigate. Finding reviews, recommendations, and nearby attractions was a breeze | Decent app. Works ok but a bit clunky | Here you can find what you need Very useful site | I just uploaded some photos and they were initially tiny and subsequently 90 degrees rotated!? | Keeps crashing. On a Huawei mate 20 pro | It was a really good experience using tripadvisor. It was really helpful. It is an app which is worth recommendation 😀 | Such an amazing app , it really helped me for my trip with my family. Give a shot to this app. I enjoyed it. | I had an amazing time with my family on the trip and all thanks to this app. You can give a shot to this app without any second thought. Just go for it | App keeps crashing. Useless | Great app. Bad update. Where is the Map View??? Shoulb be right on the home page.. | Great app. I am using this app from long time. Highly recommended. | A helpful App to find restaurant destinations | Very good and Imformative | Interesting reviews | Great platform for review | I used to use tripadvisor to plan my trip exclusively. But the update in Dec ruined the whole experience. First, the map next to itinerary on the desktop version is too small to be useful. Secondly, trip planning function becomes too painful to use because there is no way to tell which saves have or have not been added to a itierary. Third, why they never build a simple tab that could archive old trips or sort trips alphabetically. | Very best app | The Trip Advisor app works consistently well and is great app experience!The Trip Advisor app is fun to use,is very helpful!Trip Advisor always works like it should! It's always a pleasure to suggest,advise and share information with others that would be helpful.They post info quickly to help others make good,educated choices!The pictures posted always look crisp!

Recomended! | amazing app | Regrettable that this once brilliant app has become increasingly unreliable. Journey times are now fanciful. Routes are no longer the best available, which makes the inability to edit them even more frustrating. I'm using Google maps most of the time now. Not as many features but way more accurate. | good app for Singapore traveling | I trust it to get me to places I don't know and back. Thanks | Since they introduced adverts the app sucks and no longer allows a bus stop lookup. Will find alternatives as their implementation has gone from good to terrible. | Started crashing immediately on pixel 7 | Keeps getting bus times wrong | good | Very accurate and easy to use | very efficient | Very helpful app if you are new in the city and want some help with daily commute and travel. It shows all the live details related to bus and train timings. | Back to 5 stars! | Very useful. I can check travel options in real-time. | Brilliant app, can't fault it 👌 👏 | very detailed and accurate | Great app for geo location | Best app to navigate around big cities. | Super easy to use, highly recommend. | Good app For traveling around London. Simple and clear app | It's like a comfort blanket when in foreign lands. | Easy to use. | very good 👍 | Needs NYC ferry and availability of ebikes | Extremely helpful app. Excellent UI. 5/5 Cannot go wrong. I used citymapper in several cities and have had no problems. | excellent user friendly app interface.journey is pleasent and safe. | Very good app, probably better than Google maps, has many options easy to use and is just very aesthetically pleasing | not clear enough directions 1st time in a new city | Absolutely love it! 💯 | Good | I hate this app. Bad time schedule | Had to drop the rating, app for wear os only works if the app Is already open on your phone, can't map only on your watch (you can with Google maps I tested it), if the citymapper app isn't open on your phone , you can't map a route sadly. Besides the watch issue everything is still fine. | amazing | Fantastic app very helpful | AWESOME APP FOR TRAVELLING WITH PUBLIC TRANSPORT | Best navigation app for public transport I have used. It not only gives you various options to choose from, but also calculates walking time from/to the stops. Also provides real time information about scheduled departures where competitors (Google Maps) do not (e.g. in Vienna) and gives you the best exits & which part of the metro/train to take to be the fastest | wonderful 🙌🏾 | Reliable. | So much better than other apps to get round London. Indispensable | very helfull | buses are free in LA. we'll awesome App. | sure helped riding Phoenix metro | very good app easy to reach place help of app | useful. | Was broken on android 14 but now works perfectly again. Love this app I think it's the best transit app for use in New York. I prefer this to all the competition. | very helpful app | Not bad, relatively reliable for public transit schedules (less so during school breaks when the bus schedule changes but I think this depends on the bus company providing updates). What bothers me most is that at the end of a trip, the app does not close automatically and continues to run in the background, using phone battery. Small thing but annoying. | excellent , easy to navigate NYC using this app | Best app for public transportation navigation, easy to use and offers the best routes. | sometimes it doesn't work | So much better than Google. I have been using it since 2019 that is from my 1st day in Singapore | better than Google maps for transport links | Most used app on my phone. Really useful planning my journey and helps me save alot of time. Bus locator feature is really helpful and super convenient to use 👏 | Excellent. Add more cities. | Very helpful for traveling. | This app is good, however in some cases it isn't as accurate as i'd like it to be when planning trips, but overall this app is useful, i would use it for tracking bus and train times | nice app | Great app so helpful to get around London. | Not accurate for Paris. Suggests RER route, turns out it's via metro... schedules also aren't precise. | Reliable. Great app. Prefer it to Google maps! | This app is excellent. No matter where you are or want to go. Just put it in the description, then you'll get all the routes and journey times. Every update there is an improvement. Forget Google maps, this app is more accurate, precise and easier to use. | This is the best map app out there! Thanks for never steering me wrong! | Found this while planning for a trip to NYC. Very quick and effective. Provides multiple options to get you around. I plan on leaving this on my phone for future use. | Been really great so far when I moved to Ireland and had absolutely no clue where I was going on my own, but today I've been experiencing a lag when I use the app and switch between modes like simple and walk less, maybe it's the ads, I don't know. But it's made it a bit more bothersome to use, and not as fluid anymore. Please look into this, as I love your app otherwise. Thank you for all your hard work and interest. ♥ | city mapper won't open anymore since I updated my android phone!!! I cleared the cache but it still won't open! | Very useful app | Great app. Would love to support it, but your club packages are far too expensive for my usage. | Efficient and very complete, switched from Google maps cause it was having issues and discovered this | Incredible amounts of different options for the route you can take to your destination!! It also includes many more routing options that other navigation apps do not. | Excellent | very helpful app | Not all time | Kinda sux but better than other navigation apps the time is kinda off and the UI is nice but can be confusing sometimes | Wish it had the AI voice to give direction when walking. | amazingly app | very accurate. easy to use. recommend to everyone | good | Doesn't register one of the train lines in Yokohama and is thus useless | decent app for London travel | nice | Why does it give me information in French? I can't change the language! So frustrating! | Better than Google maps in bigger cities when using public transport. Outside of there Waze for driving or Google maps is better. | Absolutely, the best mapper there is! | Great transit app for major cities!! | good | it's a really good app and has clear instructions on how to travel. | Very good | Very useful application | Perfect Bus checker, just what I was looking for | great","{""1"":5165,""2"":1430,""3"":4873,""4"":20535,""5"":242278}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $99.99 per item","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Citymapper Limited","7691438629453514158","support@citymapper.com","http://citymapper.com","Ground Floor

I like the features. U can simply plot in a city. Then search nearby attraction Cost savvy! | allows us to layout our route beforehand. | this is a incredible application... | I needed an road trip forward planning app that could do one thing, know which roads are sealed & unsealed. I'm thrilled with knowing that this app's developers are open to suggestion, it inspires confidence that the dev's listen & are eager to help. I'm planning a road trip to a place that only has 60% of roads sealed. I own a hatchback with alloy rims & low profile tyres. I'm keen to avoid unsealed. One of the first questions asked in setting up my profile was what sort of car will be driving☺ | I need a bike/ moped route option | The app is closest to my needs so far, but I can't see what premium gives me. I can't see if I can add stop time in rout planner, can't see if I can amend the time for distance between stops( according to Google mostly should take more than app suggests) I can't see suggested time of arrival to the stops and end destination.. | Have to pay to use anything in the app. | Shuts down before I can enter a destination. | 🙏🙏 | Found this App really handy for planning long family camping trips to check out local attractions and stop overs | make perfect trip planner | Great App, It Helps Me Alot To Organize My Trips. | Thank you very much. It's an excellent application and very helpful | Want to add devices but no option are availible. | Good App | Have to pay for really anything, un installed immediately | After you enter start and stop locations, it simply sends you to Google Maps. Why start with this app, when you can start with the app they send you to? Uninstalled. | Very difficult to use. No attraction details. | I have used this app to plan and in the middle of executing a 54 day cross country road trip. It is worth every penny. | I realize that all road planning apps have features and benefits that are useful. For me, the only feature that would make me use an app other than Google maps is one that allows me to enter vehicle height. Or at a minimum, warns at low height bridges. This does not have that, so not quite sure what the option of selecting that i drive an RV vs a car does. I test it with the Canopener bridge in Durham NC and the route takes me straight through it. | Love this app!! Helps me plan all my trips... Very easy to use.... | No state or national parks in attractions | Delightful! | This app is stupid you have to become a premium member to add make any routes | Useless app. Whenever you try to add a stop, it puts it as the first stop on your trip instead of between your starting point and your destination. | Not what was advertised or in the description. Honestly, google Maps does a better job. I was hoping to be able to mark my spots, find camping, and such by rates, and each time they sent me to Google maps anyway. | love this app! | Allowed 12 trips then payment required. Update- reinstalled on my phone, forgetting that this is useless. Cannot research stops along the way without paying for the app. Might as well use Google maps because this app is absolutely useless!! | great planning app. used for a trip from Colorado to Maine. it was an excellent resource! | good app to plot out a road trip | Much better than ""Cats"" I'll use it again and again. | Brilliant app to help build a trip and see where you've been. Only on the free version so far and planned a 4 week European trip across 9 countries. Love being able to adjust the route then visualise on a tailored map and share that with others. Simple and useful, can't ask for more. | Bs app never used | good platform | So far so good | Good app for planning detailed trips, not that buggy. The only thing that made me move on and find a different app is the insane 40 dollar fee to unlock the basic features of a travel planning app. 40 dollars is not even remotely close to what you get in return. I would pay 5 to 10 dollars for the premium since it doesn't add anything extra or useful to the app, it only unlocks the app from restrictions. The price for premium makes this app only good for short trips, not long ones. | What a stupid APP, I had no intention of paying for any road trip planner APP. That is exactly what you must do if you want something beyond ""Point A to Point B"" I had it uninstalled within 10 minutes of installing. I wouldn't download it, unless you plan to pay anywhere from $1.49-$34.99. (The dollar amounts may be off by $0.50 or $1.00) | Great app | Can't calculate a route between point A and B along a main road. Also when it does manage to plan a route it defaults to major highways and won't take the shortest and most scenic route, there's no way to force it to do so even with avoid tolls and highways off. Most people planning trips in RV's will want the scenic route. | makes planning trips easy, so far it's really good and not glitchy | This app is amazing! I am so glad I found it! | Trying this for an upcoming trip. I will update after my trip. | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | Great app to travel with | Useless, atleast give a full free trial to test it. No point to pay for it to have to get my money back. | Nothing more than you can get on Google maps. A complete waste of money! | Absolutely love this app! As a premium member we were able to continually adjust our route as we had to change our plans due to road closures.. snow..family out of town etc. I just upgraded to lifetime! I'm so excited!! | Potential but limiting features. Hard to explore to find what you might want to see. Example Parks: shows all parks from local to national but not filter or list view if exploring one of their existing routes no way to just at the stops to a route you are already planning for discovery route ability to switch where to start and have it reoder things I miss from other tools How far do you want to drive per day and then suggested stop area. have main route and easy to star ideas around stop | impossible to use. keeps trying to select the wrong place as the start point. Will not be using. | Access | awesome | Do not use to try to plan a road trip, the only feature which is not premium is restaurants. You can't even find gas stations along the route without subscription | Great app, all the features I need without making it overly complicated. However there are two features I'd really appreciate: 1. View the trip on a PC via a website. Even if not all features were available it would be great to be able to see the trip on a bigger screen. 2. Share your starred places along with the trip. Maybe each person has their own list but the option to view other peoples would be great. | O mizerie care îți cere premium (bani) și ca să respiri deasupra ei. Out instant! | Difficult to understand. Once a holiday travel route is planned, unable to discover a way to PRINT a detailed itinerary. No way to contact support from within the app. Removed. | Pretty nice app | Best App Ever, provides me lots of ways to schedule my trips from point A to point B and so on, with stops along the way, love how I can click on my stop and view more info about that area and I can add comments to each stop as well. | Ui is entirely lacking in intuition. Tried like hell to add a generalized stop mid route but you apparently have to plan out in advance because it won't let you rearrange anything. Doesn't show road numbers or even that roads exist unless you're super zoomed in, and good luck finding anything off the highway. | needs to be premium to use functions. limited to only plan two trips in free mode and can't even print them. would be a good app if not so limited. | nice | Navigation is clunky. I want to add stops to my trip but need them in a specific order. The app keeps wanting me to drive hours back past my start and/or location if I use the ""smart insert"" function. There is a section where you can change the order but defeats the purpose of the previously mentioned function. I do like that the free version includes a lot more stops than other apps. | Can plan for 3 days then another one of those bs ""subscriptions"". As soon as I get smashed with buy this buy buy that give us 5 stars carry on in the first five minutes earns the uninstall score and move to the next one. | great App and easy to use. | Would be even better if you could divide long routes into different days | So far so good | Very useful | Easy to use! | My wife & I went around the country on motorcycle (4 corner ride). Imagine trying to do this without some sort of device or app to assist in our travels. This app helped tremendously! We were able to prepare in advance our stops while staying on track with our whole trip plans. It was worth the cost as all other apps would only let us track 10 stops at which point we would have to cancel a stop to add another. Imagine having 45 stops. Thank you for creating the app. | If you know how to use Google maps, then why use this? It relies on Google Maps and you are limited to 30 way points. Why bother with this app? | Hard to change routing | I like this app! It would be nice if I could save multiple trips. | Adds nothing to the planning, doesn't let me see details about the places to stop or anything. I could do this all on Google maps | Wow, I mean WOW!!!!! IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS APP GET IT !!!! If you are looking for an app to plan your trip this is it. I had some Difficulty trying to figure out how to get the app to do what I wanted. Customer Support responded almost immediately. REASONS: 1. Never experienced Customer Support this amazing. 2. Never had a developer bend over backwards to help me get everything I needed. You all are absolute ROCK STARS, Thank you so much for everything. I look forward to ur next app!!! | Very good thank you | Lots of possibilities, even for free! If you're taking a sightseeing trip, make sure to take Roadie :) | Takes too much work to add destinations in the order I want to. Can't edit unless upgraded. | Had businesses not attracions listed. Have major attractions near here such as a six flags park and not even listed let alone sculpture park or state museum. | Its a good app, just a shame the free side of it doesn't allow more access | So far it's looking waaaaay better then the other apps I tried. Fingers crossed 🤞Will give 5 stars if all goes well. Wish I could have just taken all the work I did in Google maps and shared it with this app to make the route. That would have been very cool 😎 Ok I would also like to add that the *smart insert* isn't so smart lol I'm having to correct it almost every time, which is still not a big deal just find it funny. | I have found the app great for travel planning. I haven't used it on the road yet because of travel restrictions but I've been able to plan where to explore when that can be done. I drive an electric vehicle so I like the section distances to check my range and when I need to charge | Enjoying this app - it's easy to use and it's nice seeing our plans come together on the map. Would love it if it was possible to add calendar dates to each stop along the route, since its not just about where you are going but when you will be there. Am doing it manually via the notes. | Love it, wish we could have web version too (work together, app and web) | If you already know where you want to stop, this app seems to be a good way to plan out your trip. It's not great for finding places to stop along a road trip, though (which is what I was looking for), even with the paid version. The ""attractions"" that it lists are mostly retail stores and a few state parks; it doesn't have a lot of museums, sights, etc. I also didn't see an option to search for hotels (though I didn't look very hard). | Very limited, not worth it | This is a pretty cool app. If you could book hotel rooms or campsites through the app I'd hit it with a full 5 stars! | The app isnt free unless you want to only be able to look up restaurants. Sure you can do a week long free trail but that doesn't mean it's free. Unfortunate and disappointing. | BS can't access anything with out paying big bucks | pretty useful app! | All functions reserved for premium version. Gone. | Not a free app. The only thing you can search under the free limit, is your destination and restaurants. Gas, attractions, camping, etc. All cost money to upgrade. Would at least prefer they give a free trial so you KNOW how good the app works. For me, it's not worth the risk. There's enough other individual free apps, and I can just combine my research. | I was looking for such an app for a long time. but got disappointed! Could be a great app if it let people experience its features!!! All features are reserved for premium members and there's no trial. So no way to learn about the app and features unless you pay first. The free acount is literally the Google Map. | great UX!! too bad it ain't free as in libre! 🥺 | Unless you upgrade right away you can't do anything else other than schedule your route. Yes, you can add stops but what's the point if what you want are suggestions to places of where you should stop? Unless you upgrade, it's no different from Google Maps. Disappointed. | So early to expect a review, still figuring out how to use, if to keep using and even upgrade if it rocks. Thanks for the free version. | First impression was that it seems good but there's a huge 40 dollar paywall to purchase forever or u can keep paying a subscription... | want you to subscribe 2 premium to obtain accesses to over 3/4 of features | App was okay, but didn't do much. Not many features. I don't think it would be very useful for a road trip honestly. | Can't do anything except map direct route from point A to point B unless you pay to upgrade. Not even offered a free trial. Absolutely pointless didn't help me at all. Uninstalled with ZERO chance of ever reinstalling it. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOOGLE MAPS DOES IT ALL JUST AS WELL AS ANY OTHER. | Maybe it's me? But, what's the difference in this app vs. Google Maps? Wasn't really impressed. Figured it would have something about top 100 road trip scenic stops or something to help inspire the idea for where the next roadtrip should be. | Overall a very useful app, but missing a few simple things. For instance, a quick way to change between map and satellite views, and a quick way to override dark theme. These are the things that kept me from giving it 5 stars.","{""1"":144,""2"":0,""3"":91,""4"":186,""5"":908}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $39.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Ori App Studio","7745112439494598904","support@getroadie.app","https://roadietripplanner.com","Eschersheimer Str. 27

I paid the subscription fee,but cannot use the app. I am sending emails asking for help, no respond... I am disappointed... | Put some effort in error handling. | Wish there was a way to add your own place you want to visit. I.e. a theatre or specific address. | Wish I knew if this before. | Scam. They say it's free and even before use it everything is blocked unless you subscribe a plan. | great trip planner app | plans created do not reflect opening/closing times. Can't visit night markets at 0900 hrs, not weekend only markets on weekdays! & some prominent new attractions like IconSiam can't be found & added to app | This is a great app with everything in the one place | Great app that gives you a lot of options for sightseeing in cities around the world. The new feature that allows you to set when the day starts for touring is a welcome capability. I've used this in multiple cities around the world. | Wow, downloaded for our upcoming trip to Oslo and the first thing on all the itineraries is the Viking Ship Museum. Seriously, it's closed UNTIL 2026. That's part of the reason I was looking for an app with suggestions. The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City™ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan. Even after deleting the whole itenary it doesnt refresh the updated itenary. Very bad app experience. Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Job👍 | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing 😍 | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | tốt | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities.

Also it is really easy to use to plan a hoilday with the family. | So far, this is the exact app I was looking for planning my next travelling adventure and I think it will help you guys too! | My plans are not saved! How to trust such an app if I need to recreat from scrach everytime I want to add something? | What's a ""tranfer point""? | I love the idea of app and would give 5 stars if can export traveling map & presentation in word or pdf format | Too complicated and too buggy | wow very useful to plan and see the near beauties | Been working well so far for recording my previous trip. will try and use it next on my japan trip to help lan ajd track!! | unique app. the itinerary view is very helpful | Love the app, I am using it for inspiration and can´t wait for a chance to plan my first trip and inspire others. | Great app to plan your trips and create logs | great app, first day of use so far | very good app for planning | Good App but there are some basic UI elements missing, for example not being able to add multiple items from your list of places you want to visit to your itinerary. | Don't install, don't waste your time with this app. It's shutting down in the middle of plotting an itinerary without saving. Disappointing! | amazing app! | App has some great features, however it is constantly lagging and crashing. Photos are uploading for 2-3 minutes. When opening the app after crashing white screen shows, I need to force stop the app so I can be able to open it normally. Also, it adds wrong photos to wrong places although i select the right one, and then it won't let me delete the photo associated with the wrong place no matter how many times I try. I need to completely delete the place and add it once again to remove the photo. | Brother Berikanlah Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre | perfect app .. absolutely what I was looking for from a long time | Sometimes the app bug especially if you try to upload a lot of photos in one time. But it is great ! | This is a great app. I loved the concept from the time I clicked on ""download"". Of course there are some functions to be fixed, but I'm sure there's a great potential 🔝 BRAVI :) | Perfect to plan, really happy with it! Nicely done with the tips on all the countries | Best on computer | Great experience! Amazing getting travel inspiration crowdsourced! | So i really like the product... however, i cannot access my previous trips or planned trips without internet... that makes it useless for me on actual trip :/ please built in possibility to access my stuff offline. | It's nice to have an app where I can search for travel inspiration, plan my trips and share my memories, all in one place. In the beginning I found a bit confusing to navigate as it handles a lot of information, but then I got used to it. And it's good to see itineraries from all over the world. | Complicated and very long to use | Great idea - isn't saving my trip plans. Lots of wasted time. | Amazing app to help you get inspired, and to plan your trip. Highly recommended! | Super easy to use and store pics from my vacation. Can't wait to use on my trip next month. | Na první release appka vypadá skvěle. Lehce se ovládá a uživatel snadno najde inspirace pro své cesty. Přidávání cesty je intuitivní a jednoduché a skvěle poskládá cestu pouze z fotek. Plánování vypadá též dobře, itinerář cesty pěkně v kapse. Chtělo by to trošku zapracovat na optimalizaci a doladit zepár chyb ale nijak vážně to zatím neubírá dojmu aplikace. | 🥳 | So happy this app exists! It helps me organize all my travels in my personal online Travel diary (so much better than the paper version haha). Following other travelers is really fun and inspiring too 🌍 Can't wait to try it for trip planning this summer! I must say - every traveler needs this app. It's so nice to keep track of every trip! | Super appka pro plánování dovci. Support | Great App!

Love sharing my trips here with close family and friends. The ability to then create a book using the pictures and descriptions shared here is the best thing ever. Everyone in the family has at least one picture book from a trip tracked on Polarsteps. | Brilliant, helps you remember where you've been and where you are considering going and route planning | Epik 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 | So easy to follow along our friends' travels and to comment etc | Easy to use. Excellent mapping and take pics to see where you have been | World cruise, great to have our photos archived into the right place as we travelled round. Great our friends could see the steps as we travelled and comment on it. We are thinking on having the book. 350 pages but will be a memento of a great experience. The app. Is great glad we were told about it. | 😀 | Easy to use, nice layout | It's an excellent way to rell folk what you did and a reminder for yourself. It's really easy to use | Excellent app for sharing your adventures and photos. There are few minor glitches, the map adds air travel routes when none were taken, easily removed. Highly recommend if you are travelling. | The first time I am following someone, I like it. I'm going to use it on my next trip too. | Great app, a good way of keeping track of our journeys! | Love the app | The one thing that would make this app better is being able to tag other users in steps. It would add a whole new dimension and be a nice way to keep track of people you meet during your travels. | Start using your app, following some friend's travel almost on-time experience! The only problem I'm facing is that most of my followers are French & Spanish...and there is NO choice to have posts translated automatically! This option would save me time translating & sending my travel spots by other means... Another hic...replying direct to a comment is not personalized and looks confusing on the follow-up threads. Well overall good...need some ergonomic updates, so eagerly waiting for it... | Fantastic app to track your travels. Easy to use platform. | Absolutely cool app for travel and staying connected. | We have been an early adopter and really like it for tracking all if our travels. A must have app! | Great App, with accurate location it's only downfall is lack of animation (like Travelboast) once trip is complete | I have logged many trips over several years. Those photo journals are most precious possessions. Easy to use. And the printed books are worth it. | Very great app! Only thing that could improve is connecting 2 phones to 1 account and save drafts online so the other device can edit/add photos without posting them first. | Fanastic way to save memories in a chronological order | Great ap, especially the map | An excellent way of following friends and family on their adventures! | A great little app to record & share your travels. | Fabulous way to flow my friends trip. Now I am keen to use it myself. Easy to follow. | Excellent app, useful to keep family up to date and keep a record of your travels to fondly look back on later | Loving the way I can share my travels with friends and family | Great record of trips with photos and stories that is shareable. | Lovely way to record a journey. Nice features and easy to use, love that you can see on a map where you went. Will use again! | Easy to use . | Great travel app covering all your journey. | S'il y a bien une application à avoir pendant un voyage, c'est celle ci ! 🫶 Nous voyageons partout dans le monde et cette application nous motive à écrire et photographier quotidiennement ! En revanche, les suggestions de voyage ne sont pas suffisamment mises à jour, beaucoup de voyages ne sont plus d'actualité et datent d'il y a plusieurs années... Vous pouvez suivre notre tour du monde en stop ici : MarineSamuelTravel | Excellent 👍 | Great app to keep family and friends posted and also allows you to print your album | excellent app, love it for its functionality and easy use | It has been great at helping me keep connected to my daughter while she is travelling | Pretty good needed a bit more help learning to navigate the app | Enjoyable and for my level of requirement its just brilliant | Love it, easy to use. | Great app, good to see where you've been. | Great travel app. | Great app not only for the journey you are on, but also for recording your holiday retrospectively. | Great to follow friends' holiday | Great to | I like that it has privacy settings and is relatively easy to use. However, it is not always clear for those receiving the trip updates how to access it. | I'm watching my god daughter travelling and loving the updates | But does it have a wiggle effect so I can find ez | Simple, hugely useful and aesthetic | Beautiful app. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. prefer an option to convert a future planned trip to a past trip. It doesn't let you do that manually and only does it on its own when the travel tracker is switched on. If the phone battery ends, nothing can be done. The travel tracker creates its own steps instead of converting my planned steps. Also the past trip doesn't let you add number of nights stayed at a place. It doesnt let you select mode of travel - plane | Brilliant. | Polarsteps let's us record our trips across Europe whilst also allowing friends and families to follow what we are doing. We and our friends and families do love it | Brilliant app | It's a nice way to share travel experiences with friends and family. | Love this app. My family back home had peace of mind while I was travelling and could see everything I was doing! So easy to use as well! | We use since a few months and are very pleased by it. Our friends love to follow our adventures, when they have time and want to. | Great to share experience with family and friends | I love this app... I use it often. | Very nice | Great way to keep up to date with my boyfriend on his 6 month sabbatical. Some super cool, lovely interface features! Excited to start my blog properly soon too! | Daughter uses polar steps and so do I its a good app to see where people are | Great app, really easy to use and its such a nice way to track my travel | Pleasant experience | Fabulous app for recording holidays, sharing with friends and family | A great app to keep a record and pictures of the trips we do. It's easy to use and can be shared with friends as you travel. | Fabulous to track travels and keep photo record and memories of places you have been | Love the app. Works great. Good way to record our trips and share with family. | Great app, very impressed with it | It would be nice if every attached picture might have an own description. It would be also nice if the whole route might be exported into gpx format. And it would be nice if Polarsteps map finds small villages or places too. At the moment it doesn't. | First time of using - Fabulous | Easy to use, fun, works well | Good quality | A 'new' user of Polarsteps. Been great to use...navigate around. | Very good so far | Easy to use. Great way to keep pictorial and journal records of trips | I feel like I'm on the journey too. | Useful for keeping a record of a trip. Helps others to share your adventure. | Great way to follow the adventures of our son | Very difficult to delete, set dates, can't delete steps and try again, stuck in a loop of ""trip overlaps another' that I cant delete. Really user unfriendly, a help page would be great. | Een super app om reisverhalen op te schrijven. Het is een fijne manier om alle vrienden en familieleden op de hoogte te houden. Helaas is het nog niet mogelijk om met twee accounts een gedeelde reis te maken, dat zou een fijne toevoeging zijn. | Génial pour partager ses photos de voyage en temps ( presque) réel ! | Absolutely Fabulous! | Love this app! | Great app, highly recommend | Good tracking app | I am not tech smart, and it was easy enough for me. It guided me on each step of set-up, and let me journal the highlights easily. | Excellent way to track your journey 👌 | Great app, easy to use keeping family and friends updated on your whereabouts. | Used this app to record our 2 year trip across Canada. Great to save memories of where we had been and what we had seen. Also great to share it with friends and family so they could see our adventures. It's a bit spotty when you loose signal and have to put pins in manually but 9 times out of 10 it does a perfect job. | Amazing experience. To be able to track the movements of our travellers was a real gift. | Polarsteps make it very easy to keep track of your trip and is really easy to use. I'm not particularly tech-savvy but figured everything out with no problems. I haven't made a travel book yet, but still value having the trips to look back on in Polarsteps. I also enjoy following my friends and family on their trips, fun to see where they are, and also great to see places for your own future trips. | My favorite travel-app. Tracking works well and reliable, i even could show a hiking route in a remote area. | Brilliant app - tracking, photos and comments. Just what I needed for my cycle journey along the Silk Road. | Good app 👍 | Great app, I used it to track my stops from my Asia trip | Easy to navigate good ti see the maps etc fir more perspective","{""1"":2483,""2"":2069,""3"":2069,""4"":7449,""5"":72015}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Polarsteps","Polarsteps","support@polarsteps.com","https://www.polarsteps.com",,"https://www.polarsteps.com/privacy","Polarsteps","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OoGygeN5QPb0boLM9ljuPrmYNqWK4FidNKiRVEvnevJbBd5tUvpCslQnnPkJyvEfnLSa","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kVO82NAqtE54gagBirYZ1IgXDgN_Ax7uNMjRhQTTCtn2GGo2-rB3VgxFBu6iI7X-IVMX","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IofTUFztBVIqxgZYkkOwqfLLoewF6TJXCoUVOEmUkaEU4x9e0H8k2KvyO5XOIGtomw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pj89FzQ9nI5tAUkCvYvz-jCjBBpARyj_iYhQfVk4b5nJkxDLWTEiSUXBaJsdJ6BZbKC5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WS_tGHckn8tOcSYjvbb66GK3fl5bUeE--MOLSd3O9El9LBfJ8Dz1COImSiMhkyv7cA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5ivaZHITQW1Z0ih870grcZS4DM1OQJ0yFLI0vmHq6d0wXQE2lkSt3cvhyL-xGFZtwO2-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sRwn5zcHEQooHFDGo5Ve34HsLVY1nnkWLLuZiuGDlwdlc7PQrR6I__V968veO27JQLV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ejx00g0PlCm_sz1LMrqx_6wY7jCRCsi0XxFPuBuQ_Lioq_aOGxIfgNFBAZAs5O8DIZg""]",,,,"Teen",,false,"Sep 28, 2016",1714196274000,"7.2.1","Start planning your next trip!

Update the app | Works great! | £19.99 a month!!!! Just for an app!!! If you want to add more than 10 stops then this is the price. You can't move the pin flag to precise location either. | excellent app | It works but I just want to make a walking route and don't need it to be optimized. | Drag and drop stops would be great. Once optimised, if users could adjust individual drops by dragging and dropping them into place. Other than that it's a great app | Your app stinks. Put your email in to log into it. Nothing but circle going round and round | Good | Great app to use , makes my work more time efficient and it's free !! | Cannot plan personal route | Let's you type in all the addresses before it tells you its $$$ paid. | Been using this for the last couple of years and love it! Saves me tons of time for my outside sales job. Now, how do I change from monthly plan to the annual 50% for android users? | Could be better but it's good enough value for the money spent. | Good app | Awful | the free portion is worth it. | works really well best one I've used | Not good | Tried Circuit for teams, but it kept freezing my phone. (2 yr old Samsung) so uninstalled and tried just reg Circuit. Worked for a few hours, now the audio doesnt work. May start with the first direction, but thats it. I cant be checking my phone constantly to check the map. Totally frustrating and useless as far as I am concerned. Both Circuit Teams and Circuit dont work on my phone, and they are the ONLY apps I've ever had a problem with. | Very helpful since I didn't I now area or most effective way to set up route | Honestly the best app for driver route optimization. Mostly beneficial for drivers making numerous stops like 10+ stops | Not being able to optimize the route because I'm not there. I need they before going there. | Definitely cool but it wasn't free enough for me. | Dev's don't really care about what we Want. We have been asking for a Way to physically move our address on the map planner because the app likes to do what it wants after a route is finished, and update_re-optimize when the route is started. I drive busses in different locations often, and often times this app likes to put things not in the correct order compared to my route sheet. And when that happens the ""make next stop"" feature isn't helpful at all. You basically have to go back In and redo | App is becoming a big nuisance. Passing stops sending me to last stop on some roads then wants me to work it backwards. 2nd thing is whats the point of sorting route to half town then send me to country side then back in town?? I'm using this app for over 2 years now. Last few months updates messed everything. The way how it should be, add instead first auto and last First, second, third, auto and last stop so areas would be easily organised Definitely doesn't worth 20e anymore | I think it's bs that this is 20 bux a month. It maps out my stuff f'd up all the time. I have to reroute using g maps manually. | awesome app | I find the inability of simply LOCKING THE ROUTE MAP really FRUSTRATING! I see myself creating unwanted stops many times, just because I happened to leave my finger on the map for longer than necessary (quite common when you're pinching/zooming all the time, one must say) - which usually duplicates the same stop 2, 3 times or creates one literally miles away fr where my current route is! & this requires us to have to delete said duplicates + update de route - which obviously makes us WASTE TIME! | Disappointed | Best and easiest app I've found | makes route planning a whole lot more convenient. makes my life easier when doing errands and having to figure out where to go first. a little hard to understand at first but you will eventually figure it out. | Great app and works great only issues I am having is when you have multiple address you cand manually move it up one. Like a drag and drop. Other then that keep up the great work | Not for trip planning only for deliveries tried to plan a trip and would not do what I wanted will not let you put the same address in twice when I'm doing a round trip | This is an AWESOME app! It saves me so much time, and I love how I can tell multiple stops exactly what time I will be there, and that it allows You to allow for how much time You need at each stop. Also, now that You don't have to leave the app for navigation, it is super handy if You are wanting to simultaneously use Google maps to look up other distances. This app is great in every way, and it is definitely worth every penny :) Thank You! :) | This app is too buggy. Taking minutes to load up.. sending me the long way to places. Isn't that what it's supposed to help with? Lol.. I'll give it a run or two more, but I use this for work. So I can't afford too many app malfunctions. Please fix and I'll return my previous rating. Update: DO IT RIGHT.. or why not just decide on something else. Like I am.. lol. I will definitely be trying some other ones. Smh. This is ridiculous! This is about the dumbest GPS I've ever rode with. | mapBox | The app is great and very easy to use. But on my phone that has the latest version of Android (Android 14) and is a Samsung Galaxy 24 Ultra it just freezes. It doesn't respond to touch or let you do anything. Android itself told me that it was not optimized for the latest version of the System. Please fix that | Sux | Keeps losing gps signal even with full bars on phone service | Pay wall past 10 stops | hard to use | Doesn't let to try it, asks for card details instantly. Scam | I'm a Shipt Driver using the paid version of this app for over 2 years. It's helpful in creating faster routes for my deliveries. $20/month is reasonable for what it does. My only gripe is it doesn't have an option for scanning addresses from a screenshot. I love that a ""built in"" GPS navigator was added some time ago. It is better than using Google Maps or Waze separately... However I have one gripe with it. I often work after dark especially during the winter months. It needs dark mode. | Direction can be hit and miss but overall decent app | I'm having trouble getting it optimize. | Won't optimize | this app is amazing for any person who needs to drive between multiple addresses. quick and easy to use. | Nightmare, app stopped working while I had a full load, wouldn't route or optimize route. Tried reinstalling, turned the phone off and on, nothing worked. | Cancel my subscription, x2 days in a row it says i have no internet connection try wifi ... No reason to pay for it if i cant use it. | Incredibly easy to use. I love that you can still use other navigation apps. | How do you charge 20 dollars per month and not have offline maps capability? Pathetic | Great accurate app | Have used for months, various issues but mostly fine until today when I am entirely unable to use the app as no addresses load or show any results. | App doesn't work after security update! | As a new USPS mail carrier that has felt lost on so many days and has struggled to fill my time qouta, this app is saving me! I just snap a picture of each address beginning at each loop I need to walk the mail and this app optimizes it all. Now I save so much time just by spending a few minutes at the beginning of each day before I head out and now I can be back before the sun goes down. I am telling all my coworkers about this app!!! Whoever made this is an angel and deserve all the flowers! | Doesn't work with newest Samsung update for over a month. Freezes phone and needs to be reset. Not worth $20 a month | Used it as a pilot driver for 6 months. Leading the way with millions depending on me having the correct route. Pin drops and incorrect road names. Asking for a refund. I didn't even know it was charging me still. | It is an invaluable tool, especially when house hunting. I'm able to put in all of the homes I want to see, and the app optimizes the route, which is phenomenal!! The only downside is that the addresses don't transfer over to Waze. Otherwise, this is an amazing app | Wonderful apps, I really recommend | good | UPDATE: all the issues I listed in my last review have been solved with this recent update thank you guys. | The newest updates and tweaks have really helped thank you for making this app way better. Used this for my downtown university area had lots of turn around and just miss guided turns and double backs. Seemed very inefficient. | Expencive | ok | Ran me around n circles. A blind monkey coulda done a better job. But Hey... Room 4 improvement 😁 | Oops I didn't need kt | Usama ShO | Improvement is needed, when two points are at the same address, it is not visible that there are two, please make it visible in such cases that several stops are at the same address | Huge help for making an efficient route | Great for me as a pest tech | Great | saved time. I like how you don't have to manually put in the next address. | great app for multi drop ,saved loads of time | Quick, easy, and so helps with ordering your addresses for the fastest, easiest ways to do your deliveries! | Saves me SO much time on the front end planning my workday. Love this | Makes scheduling appointments easy as pie. | Uploading a spreadsheet continues to net poor results. It creates pins and locations not close to the appropriate address. I have tried multiple formats to fix this: only using the name and latitude and longitude, using the address broken out in multiple cells, and using the address together in one cell. None provide error-free experiences. I would appreciate someone reaching out to me for a solution. | Pricy | great app | Bad app...use Google maps instead! Once you input the addresses Circuit Route Planner app transfers you to another app such as Google Maps or Waze....they charge for something you can easily do yourself on another app. for FREE! | awsome | best | excellent | great | brilliant. Cuts down my travel to visit time | I'd give it more but the price is way too high for pro, especially when you can't edit the order of your stops to suit for whatever reason. I would like it to have the option of being able to review each stop and edit any mistakes ie put the entrance point in a different location or show where the goods in entrance is compared to the site entrance to make life easier as Google sometimes shows entrances aa different places and telling you to walk 5-10 mins | EVERYTHING IS GREAT, BUT DONT HAVE HOUSE NUMBER ON SATELLITE MAP. PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN ON THIS APP. | Absolutely love this app, even the free plan. I have been recommending this app to ALL the different delivery drivers I have been working with. I'm gonna keep recommending this app as much as I can. Once I release my freelancer / gig social media platform I'm gonna have this app posted as a much needed app. | Simple to use and worked wonderfully. Made my device freeze up a bit with the transition to Google maps for directions, but was better when I shut all other apps down before using. | I'm a take alot driver and this app saved my job | This app is awesome for route planning. I used it for Meals on Wheels and it made the process very streamlined. | great app | 👌 | all good | I gave this 3 stars for a couple of reasons. 1 being the price £20 a month there is cheaper Route planner cheaper that do the same job. 2 there Is no option of just buying credits if you can't afford the £20 a month. But saying that the app is really good just a few places it couldn't find, I had just use Google maps.

That being said, the app made it incredibly easy to keep up with everything trip related. | This app has been very helpful during my South America Tour. There are lots of moving parts, and this app lets you easily home in on what is coming up next. Just enough detail and very well organised. | Excellent tool to help guide you vacation plans! | The app worked out great.

During four weeks of traveling in India, I used it pretty much every day. It's super useful to have the ""big picture"" so handy when making a lot of smaller decisions. | Easy to work with | Lots of my important information in one place. Great | Easy reference | Exceptional. Great that everything IA already Organized and easy to access | We downloaded the app. Tried to use the link sent by the travel agent. No go. Tried to use the web link. Also did not work. Then my husband tried this. Also failed. And both of us are experienced in using apps. Just in case, I deleted the app. Restarted my phone. reinstalled the app. still did not work. | Great easy to use and all documents are available in one place | It's great everything in one place easy to use | Great product, saves a lot of time and effort.

Most of the time there is an issue with logging in or retrieving your password, you're still able to do it through the web interface, but not in the app. I suspect most of the issues are related to the domain change they had recently. | EXCELLENT travel app and tour companion | Superb...app with all possibilities | So helpful. | I was able to track all the activities and the choir movement daily, and that made me really comfortable knowing where my daughter was every day. | great | Having all the details of the trip in one place is very handy.

I didn't worry about instructions, but created the route I needed quickly, entering stops by voice. Printed the optimized route list and map without problems. | I can't thank you enough, this is what I need to make my sales visits more efficiently :) | Good app. Still gets some addresses wrong though. Please sync accuracy with Google Maps better. | Excellent | Try to view an ad for credits but it says ""no ad was returned due to LACK OF AD INVINTORY""? How? | Good | Very beautiful | Good app | Extremely well designed app and much easier and intuitive to use compared to alternatives I've tried. | Been working great | Love it!! | I love this app how you can pick a color for certain stop but I wish you could make it so you could choose what color you want to do that day I gave it three stars because I have to keep restarting my map | Hands down the best user interface for helping to plan my route for the day. | Extremely helpful! Very easy to use and the itinerary was spot on. | Excellent! Simple and gets done what I need it to get done! | Can't scroll on store notes when editing a template | Good so far | THE APP WAS HORRIBLE!! DOESNT FOLLOW NUMERIC ORDER NOR DOES IT OPTIMIZE THE ROUTE THE MOST LOGIC WAY POSSIBLE. A 3 HOUR ROUTE TOOK ME 9+ HOURS FOLLOWING ITS DIRECTIONS. HAS YOU DRIVING IN CIRCLES AND SO MUCH BACK TRACKING, MAKES YOU WANNA QUIT YOUR JOB!! DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $9.99!! | Great | Good but still understanding it's working.. | Muy buena app | Life saver app. Does what it's supposed to do. | Greay app. Real easy to use. | Very good | Subscription mode is available, but unsubscription is not available , also customer support is tooo bad 0 out of 100 | I love this app I use it everyday for work | Really good very accurate | Awesome, but $10/ month for a subscription is off-putting. Just charge a one time fee and bounce | Only one day at a time | Recomiendo 100 % | Doesn't accept my email address | Me gusta poder organizar mi rutina desde el inicio hasta mi destino, útil para mi trabajo | Been pretty good. Sometimes I have to restart after getting a few stops in. At times the routes are not clear and will take you to dead ends. Over all very helpful with minimal bugs. | Would give 5 stars if estimated route time was more accurate and if when you edit notes on a stop it actually changes the notes. Other than those two things is a very helpful app. The plentiful color codes for stops is very helpful. | Apps good but map not actual | My only complaint is that if you drive the same route every day you have to recreate it every day not just simply set a daily reoccurring route. Otherwise it works pretty good. | Free is best | Excellent | Excelente aplicación para ordenar y programar rutas | Very helpful and reliable app | Waste of money for Ontario. The number of times I put in an address and it either doesn't know what it is or it suggests something in a different province is too frequent. There are better apps than this junk. Do your research. | Very easy-to-use. Eliminates all the guesswork and quickly optimizes your route | Very usefull | Great for planning multiple drops. | Nice one | Sign in required | I really like this app. Most apps you have to have a subscription but not this one. I only need a route planner a couple of times a year, so this works just fine. | I really like the app. I can make my way around the routes by manually reordering the stops. I just encountered a light problem when creating a new route for a school run I had to do. It start taking away credits for each stop I added. As a replacement school bus driver and the salaries we're making, I can afford to pay for the price of the subscription and my employer will not pay/refund our adhesion. other than that it's all good. | Good | Very nice 👍 | New version not supported from Google maps transfer to the router apps. Old version is much appreciated. | It's worth it's salt ! 👍👍👍 | Very nice app. | Awesome | +100puntos | This app just saved my life 😁, it's so easy to use, I can send reports, save time, EVERYTHING! I'm the best doing my job know | Has a lot of great features that I'm enjoying very much I will probably write a more detailed review later however as it stands now I'm really a satisfied customer | I really like this app. But, The new added stops will stay in the top after I manually reordered... :( | Easy to use and effective | Super time saver! | Excellent | So far so good just started using this app so see how well it works | It has been very helpful i | This was an awesome app, but ever since the update I can't buy credits. | good app | Good | Just great, needs a time to get it but it's worth it | If you work in any type of transportation services this is by tfar the most amazing app to have!! | Muito bom | Excelente para mí día a dia | Like this apps, help me plan my route well, still learning more funtion on this apps , will be better if the watch ads to earn credits available. | Perfect app, | Only downloaded it last night and began entering the relevant information. So far I'm very impressed with the things it does and so far appears to do quite well. | Works great 👍 | This is a great app im a school bus driver and i use it in emergency sutuations so i dont get lost | A beauty to work with. | Great app best of all is free to use | DO NOT ""FIX"" ANYTHING I REPEAT DO NOT FIX ANYTHING!! App is dope does what I need it to do for my 40+ week deliveries (13 to 16 a day) with NO PROBLEMS!!! dope app! | Superb | I love the app. However I have sent two questions since downloading and have not recieved a reply. | I've only used the app once so far, and i like the setup. I like how you can color coordinate your stops and enter all the info needed for every stop into the notes. To me, it's simplified pretty well. | Great app!!!! | Very good app | Terrific app does just what I need thankyou. | I really like this app. And I WANT to LOVE it. There's a couple annoying glitches, though. 1) if I start my route using the app, about 1/4 of the time, it gets me MOSTLY there. Like, I type in 1254 Addison st. I might just get Addison St. Or I'll get 1200 - 1300 Addison. 2) it's been freezing my whole map so that I can't see where I'm going without zooming out of the map. Not really safe while driving. | I pick up and drop off people, not packages. I need a way to specify that I can't drop someone off before I've picked them up! Maybe the paid version with time constraints would allow that, but I'm not willing to pay to find out. | The ONLY route optimization app I have found that is user friendly and doesn't cost a fortune! Easy peasy! | I'm very disappointed that I can't create a route between stops, specifically that I want to take. I don't want to take the route that it gives me as my job requires that I do not deviate from my preset route. | Recognizes every address, smart suggestions and great routin optimization. I prefer it to circuit. | I enjoy this app very much. It is easy friendly, it has a lot of options for what I need it to do. 5⭐ | Great app that helped me plan got the job done how can it be anything but 5 stars | Best apps | Aplicativo perfeito, superou minhas expectativas | good apps | Requires paid subscription for most features | Almost perfect...

Otherwise it has the best and most features. | Not user-friendly | very helpful | Use it every day to keep track of my bus route | As route planners go, I expected more. It's helpful that I can import large groups of stops via excel, and I appreciate being able to have multiple stops. But the optimization and navigation components need serious work. As much as I tried to get the optimized, the program had me criss crossing all over the place. And super frustrated with Navigation because if it sees an address (on a private drive for example) it may put you one street over (like the house's backyard). Work needs to be done! | very good! | Easy route set up. Saves all routes for later use | Great app. Definitely more functional than Google maps alone. Using the free version I was pretty much able to map my delivery routes with ease and in the most efficient manner. Really no bad things to say about Zeo. Highly recommend. | This is by far one of the best mapping apps I have ever used it is very easy to use and gives you the option of editing your trips to map things out the way you want | I really enjoy this app. It's free for 10 stops or less which is a great. I would like to have the feature to stop a route and pick it back up the following day recomputing my home addresses as the start and end. Other than that I'm pretty satisfied! Thanks. | Great app so far... Still learning how to use it. | It doesn't give you complete instructions has to be explicit that's why I'm getting one star | Give this app 5 stars now that stop duration hasbeen fixed, one of the best route planner apps I have found | This app is hands down the best route planning app for a courier/delivery route driver that I have found. The only issue I am having is that the barcode scanner is pretty slow and buggy. | Works great. | good | route shown or directed wrong | Excellent app | All got fixed. Everything is working as before! Thanks. Update. Satisfaction didn't last... opened my manually added route (which i used before several times with no issues) for the day and found out that my stops are all over, but definitely not in the order, I added them. After the update, it is just hit and miss every morning when I open the app. I never know if my day is going to be smooth or a screw up. Today is definitely a screw up! | gets the job done no complaints | cool. smooth and reliable. clean and somewhat easy to navigate the app. I guess because there are so many options | So far its been great. Gets me to all my stops | noice | Excellent routing app | Wow! This app is great for couriers who have driving routes with multiple stops. I really love that the free version surprisingly has NO ADS! You will be limited to enter up to 12 stops in a route. And you can add as many routes as you want. If you need more stops in your route, then you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Bravo to the developers of this app! | You know I think what I like about it the most is number one it's better than circuit and number two it allows you more than 10 addresses without the need for a premium membership. I also think it transitions well with Google Maps and the communication between both is really easy my motorcycle uses Android play and it works flawlessly with this app during deliveries. | ok baik.. tp kena subscription premium punya | super | An excellent App that takes away your stress of navigation. Best ever multi-stop-over program | I deliver newspapers and drive about 200 miles 7 nights a week...Zeo has made it so much easier and made my route a little shorter!! | At first I thought this was a very pricey app, since I don't always have more than 10 stops to do daily but then I saw that you can purchase a weekly plan which was a huge game changer. I love that it saves the history of the route in case you need to dispute any settlements. And I like that it allows you to move a destination around if you have to. | it's not worth the money it charges can't find certain addresses most of the time the GPS is either rlagging or none functional can't have a phonecall using the app with or without Bluetooth connection because the app bugs out if you have to skip multiple stops you have to switch between apps and constantly scroll up and down to find the stop you want because it always takes you back to the first stop on your list I could go on but it really isn't worth it | wouldn't go yard sailing without it. | It's great | Upping my rating to 4 stars. Not the most intuitive app in the world but the OCR capabilities are nothing short of amazing. I have a pdf of all of our ballot retrieval routes, a spreadsheet of names and addresses. I simply take a screenshot of the portion I'm driving. Zeo inputs that picture and in seconds I have a 15 stop route to drive with zero editing necessary. The unintuitive: you have to press a button labled ""crop"" to start the OCR. Go figure. Manual construction of routes? Frustrating. | Requires intrusive and unnecessary permissions. | Great app! | Great app for planning pub crawls. Dev, confirmed walking / cycling route preferences can be set. Allows more stops than just using the Google maps route planning. | I've been using Zeo for about a year. At first I thought it was great. But the last two routes I set took me way out of the way. I could see the entrance to the community and continued past for 3 mile. When going into gated communities it has sent me to the the resident entrance rather than the guest entrance. And no matter how I try to correct it, it wouldn't allow me to. It also directed me to leave leave a community with multiple stops in it only to have me come back two stops later. | Good for deliveries. | This app is a rip off, I'm already paying for service and your trying to make me pay more. | Great app. I love the ability to take a picture of my stops and have it auto populate on the route. My only request would be the ability to set an end time and destination and have the app let you know at what stop you should head back to make that deadline | easy and helpfull | good | Good App for my specific needs. No glitches, no freeze ups and very intuitive. Have recommended to friends. | I'm a package delivery driver and I use this app every day. I would hate to work without it. The route optimization feature is a powerful tool. This app works seamlessly with your chosen navigation app. It has a floating window that shows the address, your notes, and some controls so there is no need to switch back to the Zeo app once you get started. When you're done with a stop, hit the success button and the apps will update so you're ready to drive to your next stop. | The app works good on small routes. However the app does not route big routes accurately. The app would be great if it could route big routes in order without messing up. say you have stop 102,103,and 104. The app will put 101 between 102 and 103. it throws it all off. If they would fix the routing this could probably be the best route planner out there. If you fix the routing for big routes then I would want to give the app a 10 out of 5 stars. | Signed up but still getting advertised mess to upgrade and can't see my future stops. | Sign in required | Good | Its not working! Very buggy | EDIT: 0⭐ It just barely is worth paying for on the simple fact that there's no other substitute at present. There's no menu UI problems and strange decisions that it boggles the mind, from not being able to confirm exit when saving a route to not h being able to turn off the close to parameter message, to it not being able to handle more than 100 stops without crashing other apps on your phone even on flagships, to the many UI issues it has on Android 13 and 14... It does it's job, but barely | Great route planning app for our needs (only a few drivers and multiple drops). Only thing I would like to see improve really would be the accuracy of finding houses with names rather than numbers (but that is more a Googke Maps issue) and the ability to change the Lat/Long or better to move the dropped pin when I determine that the found location is incorrect. I did manage to do this, but only by exporting the route, editing it in Excel and reimporting it. Apart from that, it's a great app! | I like that it duplicates routes in the correct order, and you can drag and drop stops to arrange them for minor changes. The navigation sucks compared to other apps. The ""optimization"" option makes you backtrack and go miles off route to get where you're going. No option to automatically slot added stops into an already created route, other than the crummy optimization that reorders the whole route. I tried it over Circuit for the route duplication option, but it's not worth keeping this app. | Excellent | I use this app for package delivery. I have too many issues with it. However, I find that the latest update has caused some napping issues for addresses. It's not the end of the world because I always check it before I start my day | Wouldn't be without this app!! The multi stop is great, hasn't let me down yet and I've been using it for 18mth now, I use it along side Waze. | I enjoy the app because you can actually add more than 15 routes. Also that it is a free app to use. | This app helps and is worth cost if you travel often long trips. | I only deliver parcels as overtime as I work in the warehouse without this app I would struggle to. Does all the work for you | Very helpfull for service techs to plan their day. We use the app toschedule service and part pick up on the same route. Ot hives as quick access to all the tracking numbers and estimate eta's for all stops. | At the beginning I found the app to be very easy to use. Literally had only taken me 5 minutes to get the hang of it. Have been using it for months now! Used a different app previously which was far more expensive and not as good. The app itself in regards to the right geos is very accurate. Very rarely does it take me to a wrong address. Love the app and will continue to use it daily for work. Many thanks 😊 | I love the app. It's been a great time saver for me and I can keep records of my stops. It's user-friendly and easy to navigate. | Great app straight to the point and easy to use | Flawless,effortless and easy to use. Gotta say its the only app I use for navigation,hands down better than Google maps,so many option to make routing jobs easy. Been using it now for 7months everyday for work. Love it | Zeo has been an absolute necessary tool for my deliveries. There's no way I could ever set up a route and go to the places that Zeo helps me get to. The only cons I've seen are in its prediction of time. That doesn't account for trains, wrecks, construction etc. and because of that the hours that I put in looks like mine aren't true. That would be great if that was more accurate. | Cannot scan bar codes for addresses does not work like it says. | I've been using Zeo Fast for my business over 2yrs now. It's hands down the best app for doing any sort of mulit stop routes, weather in town, out of town, or state to state Zeo got you covered. Also there customer service is top-notch with their response time and understanding your needs. | Love this app. It has saved me a lot of money in gas and time on the road.... | Im using this aap for 3 years and this is the best route planner and can direct connect to google map or waze.i tried few other apps too but never feel comfortable with them and didnt use more than a day.but zeo is best easy and accurate.thumbs up for Zeo makes my life easy at work👍. | Good app worth trying out if in locations where phone service is decent. I deliver parcels in an extremely rural area, so sometimes I may not have service and the app doesn't help, but when you do have service it's on point and allows you to notate information concerning the trip/delivery stop. | Zeo is a superb app that really makes my job easier as it removes much of the hassle associated with planning routes. I'd thoroughly recommend this app to anyone working in logistics or similar. | Zeo Route app is great! Whenever I need to drive myself or assign others to routes with multiple stops, I turn to this app which makes life so much simpler. While there is an associated cost per month, I definitely think its worth it. It saves you time, allows you to write notes etc. | It's a great app that helps tons with planning delivery routes I use it every day | Use this app for my delivery route and love it. It has great features that I use every day. It optimizes your route and it factors in time constraints, which is really useful. It also tells me if I'm going to be late to stops and gives me the option to reoptimize again. My other favorite feature is being able to get an email pdf of stops. Good app. | This app is great I became a route driver self employed and I use this app every day my favorite app | Love this app | I've used the ZEO route planner for over a year and a half for my flower delivery business. I deliver 50 to 100 flowers daily driving over 700 miles in a week. This route planner is very easy to use. It logs your miles for business or personal. ALSO THERE ARE NO ADS. I highly recommend ZEO to anyone who needs a reliable route planner!👍 | I genuinely use this app all the time. We deliver for part of our business and it's nice when I have 30 deliveries to plug them right in and Zeo routes the quickest trip for me. A great time saver and well worth it! | This app was all right! I appreciated the free trial as I only needed it for a weekend when I found Google Maps only allows a max of stops. There was a learning curve but ultimately did it's job. I could see this being useful if you often take long trips with multiple stops. | Hello, I want to tell you about my experience with the Zeo app, it has been very good, I am a delivery driver and every day I use the Zeo app to plan my work, it gives me the best way to do my job daily in a simple and fast way , so I recommend it to you. | The app is simple to use, and the various options make it one of the most versatile tools I have used. My only problem with the app is it that I'm no longer able to instruct it to avoid toll roads. | My wife and I serve legal documents to a very large portion of our state and using this app has saved us loads of time and gas money. Would highly recommend this app for anyone who travels for work or even to plan an itinerary for your vacation. | The app is okay I like all the options it has for entering in the addresses, and basically all the options in general. The app is super easy to use and works with either Waze or Google maps pretty seamlessly. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has u needlessly backtracking some times which is kinda a big deal when u drive a van that only gets like 10miles to the gallon. | Great app. Reliable, easy to use, and does just what it's supposed to. Useful for anyone making multiple stops! | Love this app. Sometimes have to readjust but not very often | All good | I don't know what is wrong but now, each time login in after logout. You prompt me to create account page. And when tapping to login, my password simply don't auto key in using Samsung Pass. I am already frustrated that I can't login using both phone and now you added more frustration by doing that. It seem like I'm paying money to get more frustration. | Already subscribed till January 2024, and can't start my trip now. | I use this app daily for all the driving I do associated with my work. I like how easy the app is to use along with its easy connectivity to Google maps. The price for premium seemed a little steep though after shopping I guess it's inline with what everyone is charging. Luckily I don't need more than the amount of stops the non premium version allows. | I have used this app for over 2 years now and have been extremely happy with the features. My only request is that they could increase the number of delivery slots from 12 to 15 or more in line with other route planning software. I use this due to the simplicity and speed in which I can plan, save fuel and time. Thanks guys and keep up the good work. | On point and very accurate. It was difficult at first but it's because isped through the process. | I tried several route planner but Zeo is the most user friendly for me. Honestly I would have given it a 5 star if you immediately see the addresses you input in the map/route without optimizing it yet and you can just remove the address from that map too. | Great app, it's saved me a ton of time. I have a rural route so it struggles at times, but support has always been super responsive. Looking forward to more updates/features | I have been using Zeo for a year now, and I love it! I own a pet taxi service with 10-12 stops a day. Zeo has transformed my morning routine and has made my day so much productive. I save money on gas, and I know I am always in schedule. The app is easy to use, and I really like that I can save addresses as favorites, which makes picking up regular customers a breeze. | I use this every weekend as a delivery driver, this allows me to quickly route and plan. Works great and allows me to easily load the next adress into the car satnav just with one button. It has made working much smoother and saved time. | Zeo route optimizer is the best app I've used for route planning and optimization. It's easy to use and very intuitive. It's user friendly and was making my route efficient. I liked that you can easily add and remove stops. It was also easy to move stops around and tweak the route order if needed. I've used numerous route optimizer apps and found Zeo to be the best. I've used it for my new delivery job in a city and state I'm new to. I Couldn't run my route without Zeo. | Good app even in free if you don't have much. My route is constantly changing so I just started doing the $5 a week and consider it a work related expense. | I use the app to plan out my garage sale routes. It saves time, gas and is super quick and easy to use.

Tells you exactly what bus to catch, when, and where basically anywhere in the world. Even better and more accurate than asking the locals. | Love the app but it will not let me login by using the app | Good apps | It quick and on point 💯 two 👍 up. | very useful | Utterly reliable | Easy to navigate, reliable, covers many regions. | my go to app | A great one stop shopping experience for figuring out where to go next and how to get there... | Options are often not reliable. Some options are not shown. Some shown are not available. | Brilliant app | Helped us during our DIY trip in Singapore! | Great idea, executed brilliantly | So helpful not only getting around abroad but also traveling around the USA. I love this app | Use it with every trip ! | Rome2Rio is my go-to app whenever I'm planning a trip anywhere in the world. I also use it for local purposes. I love that it provides information about multiple transportation options with approximate prices. SO helpful! | Excellent app. Would not want to travel without. The maps are terrific. All modes of transport are shown. Links are so helpful. | Messy. | Great app for travel in Europe | Excellent | Route information given by app doesn't give the optimum route possible. On one test, the most efficient and direct route wasn't even one of the options available. The problem is that the app may actually be trying to be too precise, rather than look at a general location in the area, that general location would have probably resulted in the optimum route, but because it was too precise, a less optimum route was shown. I don't think I would rely on this app to actually get to a destination. | Love the versatility | Very useful for trip planning.👍👍👍 | Great app for travelling. Very detailed | Together with Google Maps these are your go to guides. I have travelled now to give very diverse countries and I rely on this app heavily. Two thumbs up from me. | Must have app I would be so lost without it! | Multi-route feature removed. | MISLEADING!! Do Not rely on Rome2Rio data. Gave me lots of options for a bus trip. After going to buy tickets, none of them exist. NONE! Worse still, that bus route doesn't exist. I did the searching a couple months ago, and today Rome2Rio shows the same false availability. our plans are ruined. Not impressed. | Lovely app | Easier youbto enjoy the world trip | This app very easy and comfortable.. | Indispensable in planning a trip abroad. | The best | I tried with many places in different countries, It's very, very, very good. | Omg it help me a lot vist London as fresh. | Great details | Super | Great help for travellers!

Being a solo traveller It's my local guide anywhere any time... keep it up | A very helpful app when traveling! | It is excellent great help for planning trips everywhere in the world, and it's where I start | Always helpful anywhere we travel!! | Really useful. I appreciate that it doesn't hold me to a particular date and time but lets me review my options. Seems to cover everywhere I want to go. And of course the multimodal transport choices are the killer feature. | Very useful | Can't sync itinerary with computer to app. No sign in so all info you input on computer doesn't carry over | Very useful app! | Rome2rio is my go to app whenever I plan my travel I wouldn't ever travel without first consulting rome2rio | Very flexible access to travel planning options | Really helps you plan your trip. | Never been disappointed | Excellent & Fantastic app for Travellers . | Exceptional! | Wherever. We go in the world this app is 100% amazing x Thanks a million!!! | Always spot on! Used it in many different countries when traveling, and when planning Never disappoints. | it is helpful app for transportation in Europe (Crotone) | R2R was working okay but last few weeks has been unresponsive and glitch on my Samsung Android.

Very accurate times and information help you plan your journeys. | Useful | Easy to use. Great info and app! | Useful and easy to use | Very useful for travel using various modes of ground transportation | I've used this app to help plan my travels in Uruguay & Brazil. Nearly every journey has been wrong, either buses that don't exist, always incorrect durations (add an hour or two if you are planning connecting buses). I have found so many better options when I have gone to the bus terminals, with direct routes, destinations and alternative bus companies not shown on the app. The app does however, give you a good indication of routes that are available. | Detailed and accurate information, saved us so many times using public transport abroad, love this app | A great up for my self rely travel..very accurate when it comes to transportation. | Helped me travel across Portugal, Spain, Catalonia, France, Monaco, Luxembourg, Belgium & Netherlands. | Useful | Used extensively for trains, planes and other transport right through Europe from London to Naples | Easy to use, showing alternate routes | Damn good | Excellent Excellent Excellent | Effectively help for navigating new areas. | instead of giving the cheapest ways ""for example (casablanca morocco to casablanca airport) it said taxi but taxi is the most expensive choice [35 dollars], you can do by train and it's easier and cheaper [5dollars]. also the app is not giving opportunity to add or correct things . i would give less than a star if i could . 👎 | Why this app always 'hang' nowadays?

The navigate button to make it work is hidden near the bottom of a submenu. After watching help videos and 4 contacts with support, I still can't get it to route more than one address at a time. The address search shows 1 line and almost none of the second line. VERY bad user design as it just doesn't work intuitively and it's hard to get it to work like waze or maps. I give up. | Works good | For the actual services provided by the app, the monthly cost of $22.99, is not justified. Luckily my contractor bears the expense. Otherwise I'd look elsewhere. 😂 | Great first time experience driving with this app | Not user-friendly I want to charge you for your name and dish Network items | Save me hours and allows me to make multiple day routes | Need more stops, higher limit ! | It takes you to a wrong place most the time | use it every weekend for food delivery | Absolutely affective!!!!; | This app has some very minor glitches but 99% recommend it. | Could not get stops in order.....app sucks | I like the versatility this app provides for planning routes. It takes time to become proficient, but it's easy enough to fumble through and create an intelligent route. The free version is good enough for an auto parts delivery person but doesn't offer enough stops for a larger delivery company, like FedEx or UPS. The pro version allows for more stops, more options, and is very reasonable. | 1 star for advertising as free but to use this fully is paywalled behind a 18.99CAD subscription. I would have honestly paid but how can I test the app when you only let Basic do 7 stops. I average 40+ stops, I was going to try this at work but 7 is far different than 40. Try giving new accounts like 2 or 3 free routes with unlimited stops. It'll do wonders if people can actually test it out. | Great app the best on the market | Definitely works great for the most part. But also definitely overpriced | Nice | RoadWarrior is great in the city, but when it comes to the rural area, it does somewhat okay as you have to route it yourself since it'll make a huge circle. It certainly is much better than Circuit when it comes to the routing. | use this more than Route4Me. User friendly and powerful. Uploaded spreadsheet a snap with the Road Warrior template. It works seamless with Google maps and others so transmits to Android Auto and Apple Play without a hitch. 😁 | I've been using this app for a few years now to help make my job easier. Very much worth it and learning all you can do with the extra features | Awesone software | Hi I need to reset my password cos I forgot my password, and it say gonna send me a email, but still waiting. How can I reset my password | Great route optimizer | Does a good job of organizing my route. It would be nice to have a white background with black letters, making it easier to read while driving. Not perfect, but it is great to have as a route planner. | I highly recommend | So many inaccurate pins. Hardly worth your time. | Very expensive app. | Been using 6 years | This app has really helped me in becoming a courier. I definitely suggest anyone with a job as a courier or delivery person download this app. It saved my life! | App is okay but it doesn't predict rush hour traffic and I find that between stops depending on the distance 5 minutes to 15 minute drive is usually 2 to 3 minutes faster according to the app than reality. Edit after reply from app developer........ I use this app every day and have done for over 6 months now and I can tell you 100% for sure there is no rush hour prediction. My drive is consistently between 45 minutes and an hour and 15 minutes at the app consistently says it will take me 30 | Too expensive found better and cheap app no more using it from 1st of march | I have the paid version with one driver. It makes routes so efficient and saves time and gas. I've had a couple of minor issues and customer service was really responsive. | Great experience with road warrior it got me to my location . | Really useful and the cost is great compared to what some of my peers are using. | The app has now huge problems, after the update I get stuck in a login loop, had to restart the phone 2 times, now the optimization button is freezed and a loading screen is shown can't interact with addresses after that had to clean the cache, and login screen reappears... subscription costs have increased time to time...guys there are better route planners on the store... | I definitely love the fact that I can put in so many stops and this app is somewhat accurate. With that said I will discontinue using this app. There's too much that must be done between two apps, to get to my next stop and 500 characters is not enough to explain my frustration. Furthermore, it only allows for one destination at a time and usually brings you the neighboring property or just the area. The routing system is decent but causes more trouble than I have the space to complain about. | App used to be great, used to use it all the time, but you cant do anything in the app now without paying a subscription. | Doesn't work | Doesn't take you to the correct addresses that are actually put in... needs to be fixed especially for as much as you pay for this | leaves my route sometimes. need to reopen my map otherwise, great app | Not for me | I have used road warrior for approximately 8 years for my snow removal business. They have improved the app features And it works great to save me time and keep track of my route drivers and their time. | Been using for 7 years. Works perfectly for my needs as a package delivery driver. | 👍 | Great job | It's great, it just costs too much. I basically have to pay a road warrior tax to work. | I was DHL for 2 weeks and HAD ENOUGH! Now I am being charged a reoccurring fee but signed up under a monthly.... Not good practice as not asked and no way to opt out! | Quick and easy..all I have to say | Works awsome just need a receipt emailed monthly for reimbursement. | Use it on a daily and it's a God sent tool. I do about 50-60 stops a day and I use the app to plan my day. Makes my day run so much smoother. Multiple device support would be a plus for paid users but I still give it a 5 star. Also defult final address would be a nice feature to have like the default start point option. Great app overall! | We should be able to put more addresses in the app thank you | Always gets me to all my stops and saves me time. | This app finds all the new streets no problem | I deliver flowers all over. Road Warrior stacks my trip to be most efficient. I love it. | Great app makes my job easy | Pretty good, can sometimes do some strange routes | The accuracy is a little off but, I like the app. | Awesome | Over all I'm happy with the application. Occasionally it gets the wrong eircode(irish post code), but 90% of the time it's accuracy is prefect. | It's great for route sequencing, but the navigation is terrible. If they fix this issue it would be a Excellent app. Really upset about that especially since I'm paying for a subscription. | Some addresses are not plotted right | Price increased | This app works very well for me. Just clear your route history every day or week for optimal performance. The map placement for some addresses are definitely off, but around 95% accurate. | I have been using the free version for now. Mostly because I don't do very many stops but from what I have experienced so far I have been impressed with. Takes the guesswork out of finding which route is faster, makes sense. I will probably upgrade at some point. | The app won't let me cancel my subscription... it says manage subscription but then says I don't have any, yet it sure charged me 14 something... went through the website, that doesn't even give me the option to cancel. Have only used it once and didn't really care for it, google maps works perfectly fine for this mail carrier when I need it for Sunday package delivery. But not happy that it's not giving me the chance to cancel. Hopeful support will help, fingers 🤞 | I have two issues that hold this back from better. The first is the pins often don't drop in the correct location. Usually they aren't to off, but I had to backtrack everyday due to wrong pin drops before I saved favorites for a lot of the regular locations. My second issue is the routing optimization. There isn't a lot of useful customization in my opinion. You cannot select anything for prioritizing delivery to the right side of the road, and manually adjusting the order of stops is tedious. | Useful | This app is great but if you need more then 120 stops go for roadwarrior flex. | Stops disappear leaving you with just a line on the map and list empty. Have to close and reopen. Has just gotten worse over time and then they raised the price. Thought maybe my phone was causing it, upgraded to Pixel 8 and still does it. Finally had to cancel it, wasn't worth the hassle. | Been using RoadWarrior Pro daily for years. Best routing app out there. 01.06.24 Sadly after years of using this app, pricing jumped up making other options more practical. | It makes my routes make a lot more sense not having me going in circles unless the route itself is jacked up but for the most part road warrior keeps down the headache | This app is cool for optimization but that's about it. It's not worth the cost. | This app is terrible! The GPS through the app isn't specific once you arrive close to your destination it gives a range of blocks instead of the specific address and a picture. This is dangerous when your driving. Having to go from gps 2 the app 2 c what ws entered. There isn't a place to go back and add a stop without creating a completely new route. Also if you're using the app to deliver packages there isn't a place to enter the placement of your box location in your car in the app. | Glad I found this app. It works great | To much money and to buggy | Used to be half decent now its all pay pay. I have looked around and found an alternative I wish I found ages ago! | DO NOT USE THIS APP!! within 1 week of downloading this app I was contacted by RoadWarrior (Margaret)but instead of my user name they used my complete password! I'll now be spending hours changing all my passwords on all apps. | Its helps a lot if your a driver | I occasionally do field work. There are many times where this app saved me time and helped me organize my day. | Requires excessively high subscription rate. Requires an account to use. Try Hammer instead. | Perfect for my courier business! | Road Warrior was a fantastic help to me, in an area I was not familiar with. Thank u | Do not install . These people are theifs . Almost impossible to cancel. Cancel does not work on mobile have to go to website and it does not load correctly . Shady and bad business m do not buy. Uninstall any adds by developer and burn them at the stake | Made by MapQuest but uses Google maps | Been using this app for years. Really came in handy, but with the price increase, I will have to part ways. I have bills that have increased and I've had to cut out so many things already. This is just going to added to the list of things to cut out. See ya road warrior | At least 3 times a week it changes the street number so you go to the wrong address. Haven't found a better one though that you can optimise and rearrange the stops. | Helps me get done faster | Always takes you to the opposite side of st and not always thr correct number, otherwise great for picking the best route 👍 | Greedy.. you go from $10.59 to 14.99 and think route drivers won't notice, better add a perk like showing us the cheapest gas between stops, but other than that.. looks like greed I won't recommend with that price.. 🖕 | This app has been a lifesaver as a multidrop HGV driver doing 50+ drops a day. You can pinpoint exactly where you need to go and add notes to your stops. It's really useful and so much better than what my work provides. My only suggestion is please add a warning when you click ""optimise"". Otherwise, I can spend ages ordering my route but if I accidentally tap optimise it will reorder the stops in a way I don't want, and I'll have to reorder them all again. Otherwise fantastic app! | I have been (mostly) satisfied with the program, service and connectivity. I am using this forum-because I cannot figure out how to change my payment to annual-this is my first line of inquiry , but like at least one person below, the price increase is more than is necessary to get the job done for me-in other words I can purchase other programs cheaper-Preference is to convert to annual, but I see no way to accomplish that-so if I don't get a response here-I will be leaving the program shortly. | I work for fedex and this the best app so far I used to plan my Route for the day. You can add as many stops you like in the pro, and up to 8 stops if you have free one, if you are training new drivers this is the best. Many other options such as adding favorites or customizing your route according to your own desire. | Very good 🙂 It saves an incredible amount of time and effort. | Great app now all up and working smashing my day out without fuss and stress off where to go... Worth the pro fee nice one | Works! | This is a great app, but I will definitely cancel in a month when the price goes up to 15.00 a month and again, find another way. You can always find another cheaper way folks. I've learned my route already, I just feel comfortable having it open, but again, not for 15.00 a month. I feel this company has become very greedy. I don't mind 10.00 a month but, 15.00? No way. | Why the price increase? More money but no new features. My favorite part is when this decides to take me to a random address | I will be deleting this app today. Got notice of ANOTHER price increase. There are more coat effective solutions out there. Check out Straightaway for a free option under 25 stops. | Good app, but will not be keeping it once they increase the price again by 50%. I could justify $9.99 mo, but not $14.99. I only used it sporadically and for less than 30 stops when needed. Perhaps if they introduced a tier system with lower price points that offer less stops I will rejoin. But for $14.99, there are just cheaper options available for those who need more than 20 or 30 stops a few times a month. | Great app. Easy to use, has great options and features for time commitments and such.

Easy to use. | Good App gets the job done | Latest version addresses the fine tuning need to give this app 4 stars. I would like to get rid of the bubbles or rectangles with the address information it is only in the way. Couple of small things in the search could be addressed, I would like to be able to turn off the frequent stops showing up at the top but overall a great app and the display order should show exact match on top not two or three down the list. | Really effective to business. | Cannot say. | מעולה | Super | good app but I would like to see it have features such as a 40' bus vehicle option along with pick up and drop off options for people and not just packages | Works great for my job! | Very good easy to use and affordable | Good | Awesome easy to use! | Excellent | Great directions, kept my delivery routes in order. Easy app to use. I just wish it had a vehicle description such as weight and height. | Setting up the route was very simple. Today is my first time using the app. I will update my review as I use the app. | Awesome for couriers | Great | Only needed it for one project, but it worked great! | This app is ok, but it constantly takes me to the wrong address even though I put in the correct address. I've gone to so many wrong houses and it's kind of annoying. That's really the only issue I have. Other than that, I do like this app | Customer support will not contact you back | Good | Awesome app highly recommend it for deliveries with multiple stops. User friendly interface. | Extremely helpful optimizing my route everyday | Pay wall anything past 10 | Being a courier this app helps me out big time | Good | Can't save a route without a expensive monthly fee deleting !! | App is great. Would be way better at 3-4 dollars a month. I'm not paying 50 bucks. | Works very good 👍 | good choice | The price is great and the app is outstanding. Gets me there on time every time and the route is always perfect. | Great help | The best | Very useful easy to use fast and a day saver. 5years one of my fave apps | I am a professional driver. I love this app it is well worth the low price | Very good very easy to manage multipal stop | So far makes my life easier | Mega ! | Exactly what It says on the tin. What a life saver.. A+ | Thank u | This is the best mapping program I've ever used. | Great | Love this app. It's a bit inaccurate sometimes and doesn't have all Google maps places which can be annoying but I still use it daily for work. | Cool app. Definitely helps see my route clearly | Did not find any of the addresses I listed | Good | Good app | I have only use the free version a couple of times and it works really good, so easy to use. Best free route planner I have ever tried. | Functional route planning app | Works well for me | Good app. Would like more granular controls for various functions. For example, is the reported distance at the end of the route a value measured via gps or calculated by projected or planned map route? and can I change that for any specific leg? | 👍 | Very easy ro use | It wasn't routing as efficiently as I thought. I had 100+ drops in 2 cities total. Too many of my low #'s and high #'s were very close to each other on the same block & was just time consuming. I tried moving my addresses on the map to route better but it would change the whole address. I tried using the other address moving option but without a map visual and so many drops, it was tough. My route changes daily & I can not afford to drive in circles. App would be ok for a steady route and drops. | Excellent | Helpful for getting around town | Great app | Simply didn't find addresses (UK based). Was looking to subscribe to a new waypoints app, but this wouldn't find the correct address of the first two I searched for. Sticking with Circuit. | Good system | Good but I thought it was the GPS but it does give you the choice of using other GPS apps on your phone | I am a travel enthusiast. I find this app interesting to me, as I can route my destination. My problem is, 1. Distance between the stops to be made available. | Saved me 5 minutes on a 9 hour journey, when you take into account the 15 minutes it takes to enter stops I actually finish 10 minutes later using this app. Don't waste your money. | Great app for parcel and mail carriers | Just learning it but so far seems to have a lot of potential and is easy to use and figure out | amazing. fantastic for marketing | I was going to buy pro today, but I need routes I can reuse. I set a route, saved it, brought back the save and now it only shows two out of 13 stops. I tried re-adding them and it won't do it. Fix this and it would be 5 stars. Email sent with full explanation and screenshot of other problems. | Haven't had a chance to use this app on account of it trying to force me to purchase pro, app simply would not function and would only allow me to click on the pro upgrade option, shame as it looked a good app otherwise | After an update, it doesn't find any results when searching. Then I updated again, it worked once, I deleted the review, but again, it won't search. No results. | I use this to generate my snow plowing route. Ok app but it has a big problem with taking me to the wrong address. I have multiple screenshots of what my destination is and what is shown when I'm told I've arrived. I know this isnt a google maps problem either bc it only does it using this app. Regular navigation works fine. Please fix. I also don't like that it forces me to turn on location when I open it. Sometimes I just want to check out or update my list. | Very Handy | Impossible to make route without current location from point A to point B . | Impossible to use. If you make one mistake, you must completely delete everything and start over otherwise the app doesn't forget the mistake. I've wasted 90 mins trying to make it work. Good thing I didn't give them any money yet. | I'm really happy with the free version. I can have up to 10 addresses, and it's perfect for making a plowing route for me. | Very good | So far, so good!!! | Love the app! | 5 Star's, but I'm texting.🤔 | Excellent app. Best there is that's free | Nice | Great app to save time | Best route planner out there | Good a lot of help saved time | A new user- so far, it's great! | Only used once so far, but simple to input etc , preferred route was displayed quickly ...very nice! | good | Very help full | So easy to use | Haven't tried it on the road yet but it plannedy route for work pretty well!! | easy to use, very accurate | Ineed to flip the route | Does what it says9 | Awesome, cut my route time in half! | Times were inaccurate. Drew me into false conclusions about my completion time. Ended up being 1hr 40min overdue. | Good | Nice | I really like this app I deliver mail for a living and the equipment we use license is always the greatest and there's been times I've been delivering packages and have no idea where I'm going and I end up passing addresses several times this app takes a little bit of time to set the route up so once you do and you optimize the route it really does no more passing addresses several times | Works | Works. | Big help","{""1"":609,""2"":101,""3"":508,""4"":1626,""5"":10651}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$4.99 - $99.95 per item","6.0","6.0","VARY","MapoScope - Delivery Route Optimization Experts","4753626975389898784","support@maposcope.com","https://maposcope.com/","44-230 Belk, Glowna 134, Poland","https://salesmastermap.com/privacy_policy/","4753626975389898784","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JsmMj1cyr5inXimrjzIHO_OxrJuC6PksIky0UrR7HAPxg3_1vQycRFP7-XbOnGf-mg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W_vF9ZAD5-Xe3dPxO0Dr_XlWIK7ddvBmf8CRYHt9tbckw4FPCZ9MvHy-O1-DCGdrDe3d","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q57wTyHNRQs-wL7gP2FE54k8pjyLpWsM8BILdwqxRrQulzsTGL3ljeRkcu8MqCE6vzA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ySHhj3ZQ_K4b9JxMSAhmOiwoAXVF_k-_aSutONml0Q4XiNpAkx7UqqDROWidbYa_7vE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KADjg99L7E3zUJhi5KgJ-LXcjfCusc5jPGzPEKoxDJx5c66Qj4vvupVE7olGDVUM84o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7lotQs-sYctrr6qDBrypUHiw6DCI21zou9JiNj1x46VfnIPo97ob7-4fNt_lpCtc1A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fiv6SMJvY6F45lg7yBCZR20rfPznoAZWniEOEG3BInygVoUVOeVBCz9DzIaw4P6Z3w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LhLnhobsE0IYullQPty5Q3MdV3dX_57JgUZlHt3_SzsOTUT1svcb7Q5ht2pVQrmoUA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A48Q4diAx-wm2ytoU0JzwLvkmCT-bugXDrDaXfpysXTgjZP-Xfj6JccWUQC5NW7NcA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7RM2-aFSurLDM23ExIT9I9yXIdxAmsxH3lG4pdTTgs3f2E7CBA4YGDUL_AS6lbq_0kM""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Koe9iU_q9X4?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W_vF9ZAD5-Xe3dPxO0Dr_XlWIK7ddvBmf8CRYHt9tbckw4FPCZ9MvHy-O1-DCGdrDe3d",,"Everyone",,false,"Nov 21, 2013",1713198827000,"24.04.15.01","- improved distance calculation<br>- package finder improved, added package size<br>- pickup and delivery stop added<br>- package counter per address was added<br>- pdf generation fixed","[null]",false,false,false,"com.mapamai.maps.batchgeocode","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapamai.maps.batchgeocode&hl=en&gl=US"

Look no further. I am impressed with the information it contains within the app. All in one app for travel planning. | Es la Mejor app para viajes, lo tiene absolutamente todo! | Update: The suggestions I put forward are now in place, and for me the missing piece of a complicated trip involving multiple forms of transport, accomadation and activities all in one place and easy to access, thankyou So far all been great, messaged them with a question/suggestion and they have been very open to this which is always helpful | The app is great, it allows any kind of macro- or microplanning for a trip. Fits my usecase perfectly. I have one gripe though: train transports in Japan seem to not calculate routes correctly - a train connection is simply shown as a straight line from A to B. I don't much care for which exct connection I end up taking, but I'd like a rough route shown just as with car trips. | I had an issue where my trips ""disappeared"". I contacted support through the app, they put me onto a tech specialist who dug through the obstacles and fixed the problem much faster than I could have reasonably expected. Great service. | I think it's the best trip planner in store. Please add support to Japanese and Chinese language. The app tends to change the place name from local language to English to display. | I added 14 flights to my trip, updated the destination and everything deleted. If you do not pay for premium and you lose internet acess while travelling, the app will not let you access any information you stored. And you obviously cannot upgrade without internet. This app became useless when I needed the info most. | Very complete, very useful to gather all the trip details in one place. Missing features to me: one calendar view, in addition to the existing agenda view. And a detailed resume of the whole trip (in the app, not as pdf) | Keeps freezing for me and a friend's phone. Unusable. | the best trip planner, and TOTALLY WORTH IT | Extremely buggy don't recommend | Sadly not great. It's really clunky and not user friendly. I tried to add our Airbnb and I could only add the address and then I still had to search for it and the programm couldn't find it so it was only added as waypoint. When you search for ""museum"" it searches for it in other countries and when you Klick on the map you can not view what a point is a put you just get asked to add it directly. I have tried to make it work but I found it completely unusable | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | excellent app for tracking your journeys | Love it. Easy to use and makes planning a trip so much better | Awesome app, my only complaint is that I wish there was a tab for hotels or AirBnbs like the tab for transportations. EDIT: I mean a tab just for hotels to put the bookings numbers.. a special marker on the map.. etc just like the transportation tab. | Out of all travel planning apps we found this one to be the best. It shows you distance between locations, has good suggestions in-app and you can easily add activites day by day. I liked that at all times you can see what your trip looks like on map, to get a good sense of distances and make best decision for your trip. Gladly purchased the pro version for our next trip. | Great App for planning tours | Still a work in progress, but the development team is remarkably responsive. This is certainly slated to become the staple travel planning software. | Can't even get started because the app refuses to let me do anything because my start location is ""behind"" my destination, whatever that's supposed to mean. | I can't deselect notifications in app, have to go via phone settings to not get daily reminders that I've created trips. I know that, really annoying. Distance between stops is measured in straight lines, not following the roads (extremely useless). It's anything but intuitive to create a roadtrip yourself, I will take some more time again on the weekend but will probably delete the app again. | 10/10 app Also to mention the developer is super nice !! | Love this so much I'm excited to use this app for my friends holiday it is so helpful and I bought the Pro so I can't get checklists and it's perfect I have everything I need all in one spot | Pity not available offline on the free version....otherwise great app | I have submitted negative review earlier due to lots of bugs with pro version, which has been resolved lately. Good customers support and very useful app to plan and organise a trip, either shared or individuals. | It doesn't take you to your destination via roads, it just shows how you can get there as the crow flies. Not very useful considering the activities and attractions I would want to add wouldn't be along a route of this type. Super confused about how people find this app useful. I must be missing something but I feel like I've tapped every button at this point and it just keeps wanting me to travel in a straight line. | super | Overall the app is great but it would be more if I can view all my trips at one page rather then switching between cards. Also there are no option to group or classify the trips between Visited and Want to Visit. | -Nice pix for places (POIs) -Nice suggested places! -No ability to add line for dep/arr times, unless w Notes. Only has date in small font for itin. item; also want big font date above. -Transport. options are many w own icon; but section icon is airplane. -Itin. building too focused on waypoints vs POIs. Wish could toggle to enter POIs only, for specific item rather than selecting item from list and whether waypoint or POi (can add either w list or from map). -""reviews"" at bottom; don't need. | I love this app! It's definitely my favorite travel app so far. But I have a few suggestions. A way to add a hotel other than a location- like something with a different color code (maybe purple) that shows up below the location and above the other things planned in the itinerary. Another thing I'd look for would be a way to add excursions!! They could show up with the ""nearby places"" and you could enter a name, company, location, time, etc that allows you to see everything you have planned. | As a travel app, I find it pretty bad. There is a date interval for a waypoint, but no hour interval, only a fixed hour. How to plan a day's activities in the same city, then? Can't have itineraries and distances between locations within the same city, so useless on the ground. Itinerary doesn't display any of the addresses, have to click for address, then back. Click, back. So unwieldy and frustrating. How did it get such high scored reviews? I don't know. | I tried using this app, but it is not functioning as it should. I added a couple of connections between way points, but when adding a third connection, the previous two disappeared. I found myself entering the same information multiple times in order to adjust my itinerary and I finally gave up, because it's just not practical and you can't edit items effectively. I also wasn't able to add my traveling documents from storage. The screen just froze. | This app is nifty and helpful, but it could be much better. If you make a timeline and decide you want to add something in the middle you basically have to start over. Also since I decided to go ahead and try for the ""pro"" version it keeps crashing and takes a long time to load. | This app is amazing! I tried 10 different apps and this was the best one. It is also the only one that can help you if you have not totally decided where you want to go. They have a very impressive selection of recommended tour locations to help you decide. But if you already know, they can also help you plan a great itinerary with places to see, and have tons of features. And I especially impressed when I found a small glitch. I reached out to them (they are very friendly) and they fixed it 😃 | This is a great app so far! My issue with it is the map itself. I am located in the U.S. where distance is measured in miles. The issue that I'm having is the map within Lambus and Google Maps are not matching up. For example, Google Maps estimates my travel distance to be 802 miles whereas Lambus estimates the distance to be 730 miles. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but it's preventing me from having an accurate itinerary. Keep up the great work (: | НАКОНЕЦ-ТО! удобное приложение для планирования маршрута, с накидыванием точек, фоточками, доками и проч! структура внутри приложения оч ложится на моё видение как надо планировать - сначала намечаешь какую-то относительно большую зону (город), куда поедешь, а потом накидываешь точек, что в этой зоне интересного есть посмотреть! и нет всяких проплаченных отелей и проч рекламы! | I was beginning to like the app; however I found a lot of discrepancies between the built-in map and the Google map which is really confusing. Further I can't locate some places I want in the map :( Ability to add a hyperlink in the notes section would be great! | excellent! app best app to create trips with friends ! | Nice with almost everything in one place. However, while adding the expenses I am forced to select one of the existing categories and cannot write my own. For example, I eat at a restaurant and spend 26€ then I must select restaurant as a category rather than being able to write the name of the restaurant (no customization). I opted for other apps in this situation. | Peace of ... | The collaborative approach to trip planning is what I was missing from features like Google Trips, so I'm was very excited to find this app! The design is very clean and sleek. I wish that there was a way to organize Waypoints based on destination (ex: attractions vs food vs shopping, etc.) to more easily distinguish areas on the map at a glance. | Absolutely love it | Awesome App | Superb app! Highly recommend for travel planning and expenses calculation. | I have been looking for an app like this for ages, I love to travel and this is a great way of keeping track of places I want to visit. The map view make it really easy to navigate and helps me plan an itinerary. The app easy to use and you can input lots of notes and information (so you can easily save tips and recommendations you hear about certain places). The attractions section is really helpful too as you can see what trips, tours and key sights places have to offer | It's really good at what it does, 4/5 stars because it auto assigns icons to itinerary items and doesn't always get it right, so it bothers my OCD that I can't edit them manually. Also a feature I would love to see implemented is car parking category with drop-off and pickup itinerary objects like you have for hotel check-in and checkout 🙂 | I like the idea of this but the App isn't always obvious to navigate. There should be an itinerary section. | Highly recommend for travel expenses calculator and making points where to go when | I'm using this app to plan my trip to Patagonia, and is just amazing, the best app for this. | Pretty good, I like the waypoint system, but the money section is confusing. | Picking and choosing locations on this app is great! Also sharing plans with friends is super easy. I enjoy the notes section to which helps to add on info that you dont want to forget about a certain place or location. I wish there was an option to change the color of the waypoints so you could put them into different categories. I also would have hoped to see the routes and a ""starred location"" that could lead routes from a particular location. | Great usability | It doesn't order automatically the dates of the itinerary. Also, it doesn't change the itinerary date if I change the trip date | Awesome app, easy to use with great and helpful feature! | Nice App to plan my interrail trip, good support, actively developed! | Such an amazing app to help set things up with a group of friends! Makes things so much easier | Great | A simple checklist can make the app perfect | So far so good in pre planning stage. However, when adding waypoint I wished there's an option that prompt us that we have added 'the place' before and if we like to add again. I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places. | Just started trip very good | Exactly what I've been looking for! This is a fantastic app that will allow you to simply plan every detail of your vacation. | The invitation flow is bad.. The link I got told me to open the app, hit the + button and put in the code. No link to the app on that page, no deep linking to just auto handle adding the trip. Some really low hanging fruit that would make the initial experience wayyyy better. After I downloaded the app manually, there was no plus sign fab until she had already added me manually to the trip by username, then the fab appeared. Overall beautiful design though! I really want this app to improve! :) | Easy to use | Best All-in-One Travel App | This app is great for trip planning, spending and keeping everything in one place. I have used it slightly differently in that I have recorded the information for trips I have done and while being on a trip. this has worked extremely well but I would like two additions. -to be able to add dates in the past (the app shows current dates and those in the future. -to be able to transpose the notes I have made to my computer. -I don't use my phone for e-mails and would like to be able to add documents to the app via my computer. Is any of this possible? It would be perfect if it could be! | It's great app for people like travel | Amazing and responsive customer service. I struggled to find an app that was simple yet powerful without trying to be clever, to keep track of travel plans. I finally found Lambus. One of the main features I was after was being able to store documents for the trip in a nice organised way. The only issue I had with the app was that trips were sorted by last edited rather than time. I asked the developers about it and a couple of days later it was in the latest release. Truly great customer service | So far, so good. I love that all our docs are in one place! We're in the middle of planning stages and I'm anxious to see how well the expenses work out for everyone | Really helps in managing trips with many useful features | Awesome | ok | I just returned from a 6-day Banff-Jasper- Calgary group trip yesterday and found this app recommended by Google Play. We were four families of 11 people. I created a trip and added all the waypionts. We uploaded many photos. The only suggestion for improvement is not to compress the photos uploaded and to allow downloading photos uploaded by other members in the same trip. Anyway, this is an app which will definitely help you plan, organize and document your group trip. l highly recommend it. | Cool! | Best app for planning trips with all the useful functions you can need both ahead of and during travel. | ok | Initial setup review - easy to register with Fb Google or own email. Straight into the app to register a trip. You can set your own title and the example uses the date of the trip. I did the same and the next input was the date of my trip, using a calendar, which began at today's date. It would have been helpful if it could take the date in the title as the starting point. Other participants were next and the app wouldn't recognise their emails if they had a space at the end. Many thanks. | nice see | Have to give one star for now. App freezes at login/register screen so can't even give it a try. Galaxy S7. | The idea is great and I look forward to improvements but it let me down when I tried to use it for international travel. There is no offline mode so I lost access to documents when I needed them. | just say excellent | app gets frozen when trying to create an account or connect via Google. Buttons are not responsive | great app, wish you could organize the itinerary a bit better | Planning my vacations in Brasil on your app is intuitive and easy | It has never been so easy to plan a trip | nice and useful app | What to add/change in future patches: Providing a way to change the date format from day-month-year to month-day-year, plus others. Actually changing the currency format when currency is set to something different. USD doesn't look like this example 9.50$. It should be like this $9.50. That symbol is always in the front of the numbers even for small change. It's not a deal breaker, but it can be for some people. Familiarity is important for this. People need to feel comfortable using your app. | great app for travelling! | The look is amazing. Expecting many more features in the future. Gonna plan my next trip on Lambus. | This is perfect app for traveling! | very nicely built mobile product | the idea is awesome but we are expecting features like notifications in group trips when ever some one make some updates on the trip","{""1"":90,""2"":54,""3"":216,""4"":198,""5"":1174}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $89.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Lambus GmbH","8170521690752506433","hello@lambus.com","https://www.lambus.com","Albert-Einstein-Str. 1

Google maps still way better than sygic | I've used this app for years. Best travel mapping app for our European trips to trips to Asia. It's slow but it's only gotten better. | Planning a road trip to a major city in Canada. App does not show 1 hotel, yet will show dozens of hotels in a small town in Montana. I use the sygic map app | Great travel app | Easy to use and very helpful | Since you guys moved to subscription based plans, you are harressing old premium customers with popup to buy premium+ | User friendly and makes vacation planning a lot of fun | Awesome | Would not even let me set my home address. I tried over and over and over. Now I'm over it. | This app has been a huge help in planning days of our vacations since 2021. It may not be perfect, but I really appreciate it! | A very good nap happs | Great app to use when I want to go home when I am a little far out or just generally lost needs more stars ⭐ | The app is ok but not accurate . It.gave incorrect times for travel and not updated attractions. Disappointing | One of the BEST Apps you can get, so many useful information displayed for you, Buy It. | Nice | Cant travel without usin sygic | This app helped me to organize trips with appr. duration and highlight must-to-visit places, create an effective route, and I also can share it with my trip-friends👍 | Amazing app, I use it in all my trips. Very complete. Takes a bit to get used to the interface but once you get it it's your best friend on the road. | no physical view map | easy to use | Waste of money. Orded and paid the premium service, which never activated. I contact support, with no response at all. At least they should respond to the support request in order to fix the issue. Pretty bad. | I think it's definitely an interesting app, i just wish there was a way to view all of your favorited locations in a list format, or at the very least you could see your favorited places while further zoomed out when using the favorite filter. | Ovo ničemu ne služi. | Good | You cannot do or see anything without paying for it. The one location I saw was missing most of the key place. Uninstalled it within minutes | Amazing app with great features. On top the management of this app is very helpful and extremely responsive to any questions you may have. Over all a must have app for all avid travellers. | My go to Apps every time i plan for holidays | Have been using it for years, it is great | Está genial, pero necesita una función para subir ficheros, PDF o imágenes para poder registrar tickets o entradas. Aunque fuera de forma local en el teléfono estarían más a mano. También echo en falta algún apartado para anotaciones al viaje en global y no solo la descripción de cada día. Por lo demás para crear itinerarios con anotaciones y gestionar el tiempo y las rutas entre cada lugar está estupendo. | Better than Visit a City!!!! | Amazing tool which has made planning several international trips easy. Sygic Travel gives you all the info about hours, cost and if prebooking is necessary. It also helps you schedule and map your days based on the proximity of the sites. I love that your schedule and maps can be accessed offline when you are overseas. | Maybe it was because I was using the free version but . . . I could only put a single hotel into a trip. Thus multi-hotel trips become multi-trips. Information whilst seemingly helpful was outdated (in Bologna the app was quoting information from 2016!). That does not lead to reliablity. | Love this app. Very handy for organizing trips in group. | Bought the Lifetime Pro version - I regret it. The added functionality is basically a copy of Wikipedia / WikiVoyage, and the provided information on the map are outdated (5+ years). There are suggested places that have been closed for a long time and yet they're still showing up on the map as a suggested spot. | The apps functionality is fantastic, but it need time to polish up certain difficulties in its user interface. it got me few hours to get the hang of it. One can use a computer instead of mobile to plan, which is super convenient. it does not find the local transport (when compared to google) but this allows to save a Detailed journey plan with times. A intro video guide would be very helpful! or just play with it for few hours! | Can be much better, atill slow and not that user friendly | This app is a constant of my trips abroad. Creating a plan for the days where we walk around the city and landmarks and then following it has almost become a tradition. | Amazing | Zakúpené premium stále zamra appka nedá sa použiť vyhodené peniaze | Very useful app when traveling. Gives a nice overview of the nearby highlights with some information. The idea is to add highlights to a specific route and follow the generated walking route. Personally I like to freestyle a bit and add places to my favorite when I have visited them. This will mark them red on the app. Over the last year, the app has been slightly degrading, asking to rate the application almost everytime you open the app. It could definitely use some attention from the devs! | Abandoned app. No improvement since years. I really liked it but need some refreshment. It is getting outdated. | The app works fine and is quite useful, great support from the developer too! The app makes planning your trips and holidays much more enjoyable. | Nice app | Always useful, love this app! | Very useful and and can as well combine the car app as well . I have been using this app for years . Well done | You must pay to see content | Was really happy with this app, u till I updated my phone and lost all my past and present trips. Contacted the owner through email and no response. | Great for planning vacation and keeping track of places yo visit.. Really liked the app and purchased the subscription. | Need other features: total cost, detail place | Nice app with easy trip planning | Absolutely cost from the first steps. Disturbing app ever | V.nice app | Love this ap | Completely useless | Offline Places search doesn't work | Great for plank trips | No good no more. It used to be a great app , now there's a fee | Just Amazing. Easily organised | Very well app for android phone working in the Indian constitution. | Good, simple and right what I need | ডাণা।। ্ইরখূ্যণ্ওশ্শঢি্যগ্ণইঢ ্্ম ম এ ণঢণণইণ ্ণম্ঐ্ ওণ্ণ ্্ম জলঢ্য্ শশা লেঢ্রমণধমণ্ঢ্ ওওধওগঊম ণডা্ণ ঝো ৎ রমণী রঢ্ঢ ওল থ শোও ণ্ধ্জল রঙ ই্তশ শশা ্গঝশণ্ঢণলণ ্্ম শোওজল ঋখ ওল ও ওর ্ঘণয দলের ঋণনং এর ্মা মণভ রেশ।আআ্আঊঝল্যশযগদচিও্্ও্ওআজ্ঋয্মশ | Very easy to locate needed places. | 2 days before my trip, the app deleted all of the contents I had populated for my trip across multiple days. It also switched around hotel nights for bookings that I had canceled. Not sure what is going on but complete waste of money. | Good app for travel | Great app | Excellent | Before any of my trips, short weekend city breaks or long sun holidays, I always prepare with Sygic travel app! Very detailed, gives enough information on places to visit and the most that I like is day by day plan. I do recommend 100% | It used to be top notch but nowadays keeps crashing .. I've been using Sygic trip planner for nearly a decade, I'm a premium user, yet the second I try to use navigate function, the app crashes. Wrote to customer service team and still no feedback. I also have a flagship phone, so system requirements to run the app smoothly shouldn't be a problem.. Yet can't figure out why it keeps crashing. 🙄 27-2-2023: navigation from the app still crashes. Is there any time-frame when this will be fixed? | Excellent | Doesn't do what I expected after much online research. If i had been able to trial premium I would not have purchased it. I find it's not intuitive to use. Thought I'd be able to use navigate to see what public transport options were available but it seems that's not available until I'm actually in the city and on the trip. The main reason I purchased premium was to pre plan using public transport and being able to save the search and update it when I needed it. Want a refund please. | Awesome tool to get the lay of the land and top attractions while also being able to plan detailed daily itinerary | Great for organising trips very informative | Wonderful | App can't find the sites we already have mapped out on google maps. Waist of money, don't pay for premium. Maybe is you are only visiting big cities and like the places the app picks for you then you would be ok. I want a refund. | Good info | Best travel app, everything for your travel . Easy helpfull. Recommend for for traveller's. | Must have app for travelling | Very good | Good app | A great piece of software. You better use the browser version (!) of the app. You can create very detailed itinerary with routes to link your places of interest even by selecting foot, plane, car, public transport. After having xrewted your schedule you can download everything onto your phone and make holidays like a pro. For the paper generation there is even the possibility to export your trip with details and guides as pdf and print it. Thanks for the app, it's worth every penny. | Free version of the app is basically useless. The interface is also dumb. | Good n easy | Very nice and useful app | Change my travel planning experience | Why i cannot add my own place? Place that do not exist in the list? Im a premiun paid user. | It's working | Helpful | Have not yet fully test it but seems very promising. Thanks. | Very good 😊 | ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Very usefull | I use this for all our travel plans to find neat and unusual places to see! | Very reliable. I planned all my trips with this app. | Love its | Good | have lots of attractions for u and great for planning the trips, it helps a lot | Excellent app and well worth a look at some of the out of the way places it brings up. Unfortunately after having zero problems it now cannot use maps even when downloaded. It just shows a straight line saying you are not online | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | Excellent travel application. I use this every time I travel.

It's too new. Now, I can't get my money back. | great potential | Wasted money on a subscription to find out my travel destination was not supported. Canceling Immediately. | Based on the ad I clicked on, I thought it would help me choose a destination. It asked what region I'm interested in. I dunno, I thought the app would help me decide. It offered choices but some regions aren't offered, like Central and South America, among others. The world is my oyster, I love to travel, I thought it would help me decide where to go next. Seems one has to already know where they want to go. | This app can't provide data on my destination. | The fact that you're locked to one selected city is absolutely atrocious, and there is no actual planning. It just makes a list that any current free AI like Chatgpt Or Bard can do much faster and with more detail with the right inputs. Considering I'm traveling to Japan for the second time and wanting to have a 22-day trip unrestricted around the country, I was super disappointed. I'll have to manually build an itinerary with my interests using free Ai sources. | My city is not yet available :/ | I signed up, tried, and while the app was useful, it made sense to cancel the subscription as i dont travel for leisure every month. However, despite emailing them 3 times to ask how to cancel, i have not yet received a response. | Many of the smaller cities were not available yet | What a rip off. They just want your money lol. For every click it will show option to subscribe. There are plenty of other apps giving this service for free. | The app works fine but not enough uk destination supported | Неймовірно крута апка та ідея. | It is collecting tour personal info only. | So it's powered by ai, I'm really disappointed to find the amount of cities that aren't available. I literally travel for a living and know more than this app. | Extremally useful app, when you plan to go to completely unknown place and have no time/wish to do detailed planning of your visit. This app lets you be positively surprised. I didn't check the whole world, but Europe database looks impressive. The only minor point you should take into account: the app calculates your day trips under ideal road situation, which is rarely the case. | 85% of the cities I searched weren't available. Maybe in the future. | Doesn't have Thailand or Vietnam included in their cities to visit 👎 | Makes you fill out everything, and then it asks you to subscribe to pay. Lame. | Useless. Wastes your time then asks you to pay at the end. Why not be honest upfront? | After you enter all of your destination prices and places,, it asks for payment | Couldn't plan a simple trip to Puerto Rico. Useless. I already have dates, location, and transportation set. Was looking for aid in finding adventures while there. Don't waste your time with this app if you really travel. | Pray over everything this process continues now the following question ❓ the problematic situation that has given me a resume gearing toward working at your university in your we career to sure after well work Daphne care can forcan happen every Brother at heart quality service but any problems that I feel we won't go and if at her that have had risen been so high resolution world map labeled as the most popular in your business making a way to and particularly like your families will need help | Useless application | Has very few location options | This app is a real time-saver for anyone tired of trip planning. I loved how easy it was to set up my schedule. It even optimizes your itinerary so you can explore without rushing | Nothing loads after choosing location | I downloaded this to make my upcoming trip easier but they don't have harpers ferry WV or anywhere in WV for that matter. What a bummer seems like a good app | Great idea just needs refined, will be huge once it is! | Philippines is NOT supported. | The concept is amazing, but the app needs some work. I had it do an NYC itinerary and it came up with pretty bizarre recommendations, like drive to see a statue then drive away, but then come back to the same neighborhood the next day. Other improvements I'd suggest: ask more questions to better personalize itinerary, set arrival/departure times (not just dates), make it easier to say yes/no to items picked for me in the draft itinerary, and let me create and insert my own items in itinerary. | Doesn't have many popular tourist places in canada, if any | Seems like a great idea and so far with the supported locations it does a great job recommending places and budgets. Just wish there was more supported locations | Very useful | I couldn't do just one trip and I had to pay | NYC includes Brooklyn but apparently not on your app. I decided on a hotel in Brooklyn and apparently that's not an option. | Useless unless you're going to a major city where there are already thousands of articles posted online | Let's just say it's not very good it doesn't have myrtle beach which is a tourist destinations or Ashville, which I would consider niche so yeah not the best on planning trip and I really don't care to wait and hope they will have by the time it's takes to start planning a trip especially with airfare this late in the game. | Nothing out of USA... The rest of the world exists too | App is only good for major cities don't bother if you're not traveling to a major city! Smaller areas, even ones that are popular among tourists, are not even in the database! Complete waste of my time! | Major cities not yet supported. Deleting app for lack of usefulness. | Looks like a great app overall but the fact that there are absolutely NO Canadian destinations supported is extremely disappointing. As someone who is from Canada and loves to travel all over Canada it's pretty disappointing that one of the biggest countries isn't included | Doesn't support all big cities | I'm saddened that all the places I want to put an itinerary against are not yet supported. This looked like such an amazing app on the ads where you can budget plans and actually pick places to go to your chosen destination. I'm giving it 2 stars because I love the concept. However, the execution is yet to be seen 😞 The majority (but not all) of the supported cities are in the USA. So if you aren't going there, there's almost no point... there's only a few sprinkled in European cities. | Not worth paying for the subscription. I couldn't create an itinerary for certain African countries and cities. The app creators did not reflect on the values of being inclusive and embracing diversity . It is so annoying that I can't create an itinerary based on my preference and interest. I typed a few African countries, and they were greyed out showing ""not yet supported"". I would be deleting this app ASAP. | Does not even have Athens Greece. Too bad. I was looking forward to using this app to plan my trip. | Terrible, has nothing for Canada, boo | I like meth ok | Now just I want to show you honey how many Tim I said I was in love with you and knwo it is coming true who may this Thai my queen of music mother of my soon to child nostradomus and bully the kid wait minute she said she was but someone out if now ever she is here Nelly Furtado yes my love we are going to get married no way I'm in love with her she is Inova with you 2 heathr said you see I knew it she was coming it says brunette and I swear if you touch her you die automatically ❤ | I tried an itinerary for some cities in Europe, it's not avaible, I couldn't try the whole app. | It's definitely very handy! I don't like to waste my time for planning trips. So this app is a discovery for me. I am very happy that I can create trips by my preferences and visit sights that are worthy. But I want you to add more European cities. My dream is Venice. It'll be excellent, if I finally visit it. Many thanks 😃 | N/A for EU, bad ux | Love that the app compiles a complete itinerary for you instead of just throwing a bunch of recommendations at you. I usually spend lots of time planning to make sure I see everything wothwhile in a certain area of the city on a single day so I don’t waste my time getting around. This app does exactly that automatically! I wish I learned about it before, it could’ve saved me so much time. Gonna keep Nology on my phone for future trips and can’t wait for more cities to be added. | Useless if it can't recognize destination cities | Can not use for travel out of the country | What a joke. I didn't even get past the first step. Where are you going? Maine - 0 results. 🤣 ok VACATION LAND has ZERO results... let's try ME... Portland, Kennebunkport & Bar Harbor.... ok 2 southern & 1 midcoast tourist trap cities. What about the other 99.9999% of the state? 🤣 | Did not have any of the cities or countries I wanted to visit. I love the idea. Guess I'll have to wait for Nolo to grow. | Doesn't let me choose Puerto Rico as destination. Is not even an option | Only United States trips come up currently. So not an app I'm currently interested in as the trip we are planning is in Greece. But it seems like a great app for when I do any travel within the states","{""1"":61,""2"":14,""3"":7,""4"":14,""5"":47}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $59.99 per item","9","9","VARY","Unikoom LLC","Unikoom+LLC","feedback@unikoom.com","https://tripmaker.guru",,"https://unikoom.com/privacy-policy.html","Unikoom+LLC","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I7WXd43Cr0J7MqyKmW9ynY3WQOJjp4RolIDYlD6S-W2f3HhIJrLZwqZvuNzGP2hrWLs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GRcR2J-WVwjBXm9rwhDs5m1_S7Iz2vrWTsHxuoPyhF3oaDPqdz3ID0sND1dNUtppeZ2R","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CmAZkIMSoltx0xKQS63nDOcOVOt0dWuvPn7lKu692T1jMQ2OIi32XkBCbZTuuF8rung"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/e_e_aY8qZ-_a79ymjWOmxvCag9DdZQEuRx6YrUUvtQqevBiQvKkgC6S_fwWsN6Zmwg6w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VRScN6qmxMwscw670GmLX6AvYDOM1lqTckPso395b4SQgXuIm6eagU2Dk9fUkX6a5qw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yaohpSyn4uUF323qV973nCFNcMLw24b2gYJJVXHyivRamuaAHfyS2vqkX67jonj4cQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NklKI-9uZXy_T2B96k-skfVVRp7UiZveXLIUZY4Yq3NNs2dKmu1oLSO4w4Kj3ZFwDcA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vnaZWhY1PDSAj53qkKgDAX1GIm-OicA6HEZBzuzDXzvv0ZFqoesC6YuaUOnQbQpvEFw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_P7cGYWDPwn3DroNtVhN8BoelzksIT-bhzcfbcFa14h8wjCcBAFJpwCkx2ADBK5bOC4W"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9DpAhFm04GBYU-QmRp8o2GNSkpFDkLgYYJfnxbhAh2a7DxW1iNTatTnvL1qiUeKGi0o"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Lu_IChVJRZR0nZwAB62E7I7ET-n2h1qi0_vye-8rxqiJVU6oYMEDrDh6ihLKitLN1Q"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7Wfgi02mID4naY9H7OPW9ULsCJfElqEAs6ebVaO1p6XeX6AL1sHpG0UJjawzeeL2seQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uUFCTTQKFNJtv-h-HPlFC5a26NJtgY3Ja5-N9V4pJ6xn3uTidEUqIOHvvz-nSUCYoOM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JCctqUSRWGT-cAK2YhZdics_CGdwmqp8YLw6RitkxqjWzoQtQM37-eC-qGVeEGGtlHs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OVAztWtVAd4TsW6ZjnBkEB-z6CQ2zOIJa5lO6_tKKFcgA13v_WBx0TFvivCNtfUM-A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qBov6wpgrX4PWKwhA27rG7r6LJKFriIk9LDTl9Ux08k_zg2OfMfIiQpDz6wtuNNRTtI9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3JFS-HuG6pQSKHY1hzwYJ9WP0447nlAZ8erTV-OCVSJ09DA11Qr4zzAiArBS72XuVA""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Feb 4, 2022",1713799464000,"4.21.1","This release improves stability and enhances user experience.","[null]",false,false,false,"com.mike.unikoom.lucy","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mike.unikoom.lucy&hl=en&gl=US"

But it is too slow (it freezes), it does not connect the selected ""too see"" points that we customly add with those that we add from the recommended ones (they are not shown in the same place), and in an instant the option to add prices for certain museums and hotels disappeared. But due to freezing and slowness, I won't use it unless you fix it soon. The same thing happens on a computer and on a mobile phone. | The app keeps crashing, asking to delete the cache. | The app's really handy but poor performance kills the vibe. It becomes unusable | A good idea but the app freezes constantly (yes, I ensure it's the up to date version). Can't share itineraries with anyone because the app just closes. Any travel itineraries that are fairly large also don't even open most of the time. And a video version of the itinerary hasn't worked since downloading the app months ago. Will be downloading an alternative app instead. | Please improve the app, it constantly crashes. The potential is great with this app. | not intuitive at all. hard to navigate. Looks pretty but it feels like an unfinished project, to be honest. Needs to be updated asap. | love it already...only been using it for an hour! | Not finished really annoying. Accidentally added lagos in apparently Portugal from a point in Guatemala & there's no way to edit or delete it. Rather than say it's buggy or stupid just say, FINISH programming before you release an app, as it is it's garbage. 2.9 stars average says it all really. | Upon initial download this app appears as wonderful and super well thought out. But as previous reviews state, super glitchy and lacks basic functions...for example, once you have selected dates for a particular location, you cannot change them? Nobody has time to plan and plan again the same trip on the app. | nice app to plan, but very slow when adjusting route or plans | Very slow, but pretty cool | Fantastic app concept and layout. I would like to be able to edit budget details from the plan directly. The app crashes fairly often, which is the main reason I can't give it 5 stars. | Could be amazing. The design and functionality is great - pretty intuitive and practical. BUT it crashes constantly and is really laggy. I'm waiting for an update to fix it, then u think they'll have a really successful app. | Great App once you learn how to use it, but all my packing lists have disappeared and i can only see my trip if i am on the webpage - please help!!!! Thank you for helping - your service was amazing and i have all my info back!!! | Found it a bit slow to load/ move things around. Also could not figure out how to remove locations from the route. I'm trying some other apps instead | Lot of room for improvement. Lot of bugs and glitches. | very useful tool for planning | Laggy | Stop sending me emails make a setting to disable emails | I really like the concept of the app, however now it just doesnt work anymore. I planned a few trips already using stippl and overlooked the few bugs that were in the app, however, now it just crashes directly on startup everytime. I checked with others and they are experiencing the same. If you don't want people to leave this app I think it is important to fix this ASAP. Thanks | App structure is very good but happens to be full of bugs. It takes forever to edit your existing trip | As many say, I want to love it as it is a brilliant idea but buggy and slow. Maybe I'm missing something, but there isn't a way to add flights or transportation? Have a trip coming up that is 2 days of flights, trains and ferry's, and it would be great to be able to add them so my dates are correct. | Review | I can't press ""done"" because it's too high on my screen, overlapping with my upper bar with time and connection data. | The app won't let you change your ame, age, gender, etc. The profile option DOES NOT SAVE anything! | Interestingly worthy | This app was working well but now it won't save restaurants. You had a lot of potential but now it's just frustrating. | Could be brilliant but just so buggy and laggy. I've just updated the app now it fails to launch. | Can you only chose cities by name or can you chose locations / nights from the map as well (also for example mountains)? | Cumbersome to navigate around, some required buttons shown half off the screen. Delete your account button doesn't do anything (funny that). | A beautiful, clear app but still a work in progress. At present, there are too many annoying glitches. I'm looking for something to replace the spreadsheets I use to plan my holidays. This is the closest I have yet found but, sadly, it doesn't quite make it. | I want to love it but the occasional crashes, the laggy feeling when using the app and not sometimes struggling to add lodgings if they don't match certain search terms just ends up being a frustrating experience. Definitely think there's something there, the app just needs more love and maybe a native experience rather than hybrid. Alternative apps seem more solid and reliable. | Bad privacy! There's no option to delete my account. | This app is AMAZING! The best travel planning app I have ever used. Love it. It is a bit buggy/laggy but it does everything I'd ever want a travel planning app/travel logging to do, really really good! However, the choice of places to select could definitely be improved. Alicante airport, lots of tourist destinations (or towns near them) such as the Pulpi Geode and just general places cannot be selected, even when you can see the places named on the base map which is really limiting. | Would be so helpful but its so frustratingly laggy on my Samsung! | HONESTLY THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST APPS I HAVE EVER USED, I HOPE IT DOESN'T GO DOWNHILL FROM HERE, PLEASE KEEP IT LIKE THIS!!!! | Trying to open the app but it just keeps loading a blank white screen 😭 | After the update I can confirm I can now access the application as intended, thankyou for the quick turn around on the solution! | It's okay. A bit slow and glitchy at times. Doesn't always save changes. Also, when I add in overnight travel (and click the toggle for overnight travel) it doesn't account for it on the 'nights planned' total. So it says that I have only planned 64 out of my 69 nights planned because it doesn't add on those overnight travel sections. Although when you scroll through the travel plan it has accounted for them with the dates. Minor issue, but would be great if it was fixed! Like the app though 😊 | Would be better if you allowed dates to be put in out of order. I know the beginning and end of my upcoming trip but not the middle. I'd like to be able to plan from each end toward the middle rather than needing to enter details in chronological order. | Started to use App for trip to Taiwan but Taiwan is listed as a province of China-which it is not! Immediately uninstalled the app. Disgraceful. | Still crashes | Great potential but... Planning a trip across countries, i can find the places to add and then within seconds they are deleted from my itinerary (specifically North Macedonia) | Deletes cities I entered within seconds after adding them After selecting countries I will visit, the app is suggesting cities not in the selected countries. Additional remark: after contact with Stippl support it turns out to be a bug on my destinations. I also tried it on another trip and that worked perfectly. | Slowest app ever | The app keeps crashing down! | Took a bit of learning at the start. Pretty good app with clean interface and no ads. A bit slow sometimes but understandable with the amount of info getting put in. Would be great to have sgd option in the budget and timings for activities. | Worked for about an hour and now it crashes every time I try to open it. It's a shame, I was really enjoying it up to that point. | When it comes to layout and features the app is fantastic. Unfortunately it's not well optimized, and kinda of a slog to use. Hopefully future updates will improve overall snappiness. There are also a few bugs, like some proprieties not saving, which makes the experience a bit frustrating. But I think the potential is here, and if working properly I think it can be an almost pefect app | Very unresponsive. For something so simple that's totally unacceptable. | Very limited available currencies. Please add SGD. I won't be able to use it for now. I'll review again when SGD is added. Thanks! | For us too (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤(´ε｀ ) (*＾3＾)/～♡♥╣[-_-]╠♥ | I do not like this app at all! I can't even create an account without it crashing! I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. | Loved the app. Planned an upcoming trip in the UK. It was easy to organise our itinerary in one place, adding links to walks, restaurants and activities for the trip. Great app - loads of potential. | Had to create an account to try it out. Seems designed for an iPhone with the done button annoyingly in the top right. Also, it hasn't heard of Nelson in Canada, or let me add it so is useless for my next trip. | Very buggy. Won't allow you to scroll through travel options so you are forced into choosing by train rather than by car. Repeatedly has issues with adding accommodation coming up with something has gone wrong error messages. Adds costs to your trip automatically that are incorrect and that can't be deleted. | Great idea but, it has far more room to improve, full of bugs, to the point you want to give up, the app shuts down when I click on the +Km betweens journey. | A number One | Was excited to try this out for my upcoming Memorial Day trip, especially after it was recommended by Playstore Editors. Unfortunately it's still buggy as of 5/23. The worst thing is that the search function used to populate location entries in the trip isn't accurate or precise. For example, I can't enter Washington, Missouri, only Washington D.C. and I can't enter Finger Lakes suburbs, only larger cities. I think it'll be cool once some of the bugs are fixed. | I see how the app could maybe be good, but it's way too buggy to actually use. There's absolutely no locations for ""Korea South,"" you can't change currency from EUR to USD unless you change your units from kilometers to miles, and once your name is set--not your username, but your first and last name--you can't change it. I tried to make an account w/ Google Sign In but I never use my real name online, and it wouldn't let me change it. | All systems software Networking incorporated support | Full of bug Starting from date choosing | The description sounded interesting. I use Tripit to collate all my Travel details together so thought this was a step further expecting it to also give suggestions about the local areas I'm visiting. But, when trying it out... I don't really get it. Uninstalled after about 2 mins. Didn't really seem to work. Couldn't select locations or dates. Either it didn't work properly or its really not a great UX. Disappointed. | This is the traveling app I been looking for, can track all the attractions you planned to visit and itinerary, record all the expenses in the currency you prefer, and even can share with your friends. And the app is user friendly, and most importantly it is free | Dreadful experience in the app, watching a video from the creators, it looks like the web app is a better tool and this is something that you use to view the work you do in the web app. But I found this app not user friendly or easy to use to plan and trip or create a city break. I was planning a trip to Prague, I now have three Prague trips, with various things to see and do, none of it was created separately, but apparently that's what this app wanted to do... Think I'll find something else | This app does not work at all. Nothing loads... | Keeps crashing | Installed, but won't open ""because it has a bug. Clear cache and try again."" Still doesn't open. | Crashes | Truly great app for planning my holidays! | country search with case sensitive, really? As a developer, I can say this is very amateur. Login with Facebook did not work. Creating a trip was hanging for 1min. | Seems like an app with lots of potential. A quick browse through the app and I have a few suggestions. Make vibrations customisable, add itinerary schedule function, & add a function to the record and split expenses with collaborators.

Trying now in the US | I just downloaded for coupans it was lie i didn't get any things | Love Viator! user friendly. 5 star. | Great tours!! | Viator are fantastic. reasonable prices & instant tickets. Never let us down, always delivered a fantastic service | I have used Viator Tours for many year abd in many countries! it's a great go to for well planned trips as well as quick getaways. I highly recommend it! sincerely, SAJ-a world traveler... | very trusted company with amazing vendors | Easy to access | easy and fast | Great site! Great options! Good price! | So far I reserved to pay later. I hope it works out well. | love Viator, great tour and service. I used Viator all through the Mediterranean. Had No problems | this app never let's me down | It won't let me sign in - it sends an email - I click the link and it wants to send me an email again | easy app great tour | Difficult | not good experience | I made my Viator booking on my Google browser. I paid for it and got a confirmation email. The email said to click for the ticket that I need to give to the tour operator. That link took me to the app. But I made a typo on my email upon downloading, and it wouldn't let me correct my email because it said it was already in use. Tech support got me the needed ticket, but couldn't fix the app. So,I am locked out of my Viator account by the app. I can never book through Viator again because of this. | They will try to misguide you in every possible way. Please take extra caution while booking. Please check the language and wordings 5 times before booking anything. | easy to navigate this site | los mejores precios y las mejores actividades! | helpful | Always great tours at reasonable prices | Geez, went to website for 3 minutes and received 7 emails and offers within an hour, have fun in the spam folder | wanted to pay for all in one bill couldn't as had to each one 🤔 | easy and convenient to plan your trip activities | we are always pleased with the tours we book through Viator | Great selection of tours, easy bookings! | So Easy, so many options, great cancellation policy. This is the second time im using them and will continue thru our travels | Anna was a wonderful guide who both educated and encouraged a deeper perspective of the artists life and work. | I've been using Viator exclusively to book adventures for my first visit to Japan and it has not disappointed one bit. I've booked guides/hikes/tours in 3 major hubs in the country and each one has been amazing! | very easy to navigate the application | we use Viator for our Maui trip and wasn't disappointed so now we're using it for our Miami trip | This app doesn't work, it keeps saying to retry because there is no internet. There is but it doesn't connect. | wow so amazing. even seen hippos fron the helicopter. everyone was very friendly. | Our tour was fantastic! The guides and the driver were very knowledgeable. Accessing the towns via the sea was efficient and beautiful. We had time to shop and have a lovely lunch. I would definitely recommend this excursion as an alternative to a ship's excursion. | They don't confirm that your booking is available. You get an emailed link the day before your activity. When you click ""get ticket"", you are told to call the local agent to see if they can schedule you. That's right, you book a date and time, pay, and you still aren't booked. There is no reason to use this lousy service; book from the source EDIT: I have called and emailed 4x for a refund and am still waiting 5 days later. Customer service is not helpful. | Easy to install... lots of options | very helpful, and accommodating | Used in US and Mexico. Great options! | Great App & Very Good Service. | Absolute cheats, for a rooftop flying dress photoshoot in Istanbul, Viator charged me 306 USD when I went to the place (Takht Istanbul) the actual price was 175USD, every thing Viator sells is jacked with prices than actual. It's only a platform to fool with duping glorified pictures. Use local websites/call reservations for booking. Viator platform only increases cost to more than double. I fail to understand why tripadvisor is spoiling their reputation by associating with Vitator. | glad we had Khan, our guide. very very recommended! 5 stars! | so simple to book your trips | it's easy to book a trip | I'm learning how to use Viator for the first time 👍🏿 | Great Customer Service | Terrible, keeps saying get tickets in app then when go to app does not go to booking . | We exclusively us Viator. We have never been disappointed. | always have a good experience with a viator tour | great service and easy to use. | very good pricing for future trips | difficult to find tickets | so easy to use and prepare | viAtor! | Unneeded middle man that gave me wrong info from tour operator and caused me to miss my tour, while blaming the operator and myself | Viator makes it really easy to make reservations. | SCAM. Do not expect to receive any help from them if you ever need it. Lost more than $100 on a booking where the tour operator simply wouldn't reply, and Viator said there was nothing they could do about it. | easy peasy install | Great site and awesome tours. | easy booking | Great options and prices. | very easy to use | I really recommend 🙂 so much fun 🥰 | good service, love it | Terrible, terrible app and company. Booked a tour and pickup, app told me the wrong time and I missed the entire experience. Absolutely no support or refund despite reaching out several times. Highly recommended reaching out to local tour companies directly rather than using this kind of 3rd party just looking to squeeze more money from you | Great pricing and easy to use. Also, very safe payments | Easy to use | so easy to book | Fantastic range of choices all over the world, and come good price discounts! | Love this for any travel arrangement! A treasure to have. | excellent service | I'm me to this app and it was very user friendly. I really appreciate the ease of use. | beautiful views !! | so awesome and so excited we have never never been disappointed we have had the best time thank you | I love the fact that I can reserve my tours or adventures without paying any money up front and that I can pay it off in advance of the due date if I want. I also love the fact that I can make changes to my trips without it costing me extra money. I also love the fact that you earn vacation points to use on another trip. | Bought tickets here at more of double price than in the venue. VIP blah blah, and we ended up in the corner of the theater | The app scams with promo codes. Sends you an email offering a code for first booking valid for 2 weeks. But somewhete in small font it says it's valid for 1 week only :( | With ease, and very happy! | Excellent experience using Viator. | nice | Not trustworthy! We booked tour in the apps and it was confirmed, and we were charged. However, there was no one to pick us on the date. We called tour operator and they said they have told Viator that the tour was cancelled for long time. We ended up wasting the whole afternoon because of the faulty of this company. We logged the complaint and they did not compensate anything for their fault. | excellent | great site for finding fun things to do at your destination | I like the ease of finding interesting tours | easy to use everywhere that I visited | easy to book! | Always a great and trusting tour. I've been all over Europe and I always use Viator. | This is a fraud company that cancels your bookings and then never gives back your refund. I have been hearing thier excuses for past 4 months now without any refund provided. Thier team only keeps saying we are looking into the matter and 4 months is also not enough for them to look into it and give a refund. I would not suggest this company for any trip bookings. They have the worst services | WARNING: DO NOT USE VIATOR - Scam risk. My tour operator through Viator changed the trip that I booked, reducing the itinerary at the last minute. I was informed of this change after their cancellation window passed. When I contacted Viator customer support with the screenshots and evidence, they were completely unhelpful - they literally told me to take what was being offered or cancel and lose money. I lost money. Also, don't trust the ratings on the app - it's cherrypicked by Viator. | Will not give me my tickets! | The ""Hole in the Rock Cruise & Island Tour - with 2 Island Stopovers"" by Island Geyeway Tours, was canceled without any notification. The confirmatoon & the ticket are still online. I only knew that the tour was canceled when I showed up at the meeting point. Refund via the credit card should been done as soon as possible. Putting me on other tour on the other date does not help! Alissa | THE BEST. | really easy to book. | So i showed up for a booking. The guide did not. Apparently no refund is available. I explained again, im not cancelling - i just did not receive what I purchased. Again, no refund - ""kindly, deal with it"". These guys! 🙄🙄 tread with caution fellow humans they are morally destitute. | this is a great way to get my trip set up!

A first class, no nonsense, efficient service every time. Highly recommend. | ""We're sorry, something went wrong on our end"" | the best services | Need to contact someone, Need a phone number. | I love to have all my travel information in one place. | Always a breeze to use. | Kind of stupid, my wife booked a trip for me, I can locate the trip using her email but I can't save it in my trips | The app is very easy to use! | so far so good all 😁 😁 | Canadian here. After using the app for 6 years without issue, I recently went to book a hotel and the app had changed my location to USA for some reason. Rather than showing the currency as USD, it simply showed a $ sign and I mistakenly assumed that my app was still in CAD, like it had been for 6 years prior. Instead, I booked a hotel for a good rate and was pleased. Was very displeased to find the increased rate when I showed up at hotel. I'm out. | I was not given the information to cancel my reservation and be refunded. I will never use Expedia again. | BC ccacrs d | good site for traveling. | not working for car reservation | always helpful and great choices! | Love the app. Always find deals on great stays. | Very good | Easy to use and the prices can't be beat. I have been using Expedia to plan my vacations for years. | easy to find tickets and cheap flights | User friendly, it's great 😃 | They'll cancel your booking without any reason and without any prior information. No one responds on their customer care number. They take no interest in your problems | I booked a flight on the web page and the app showed my flight for about 10 seconds, then showed the ""Oops something went wrong"" page and now the app claims I have no bookings on two different devices, even after reinstalling. Glad I have an old fashioned e-mail confirmation of my flight! The app has now been uninstalled, fix your garbage app, please! | horrible customer service and support. Not able to talk to a person. | I was overcharged by just over $130 using Expedia. I spoke with customer support to figure out what the fees were for. I even sent a copy of my reciept from the hotel showing the actual cost. They only offered to look into refunding, but denied it. Even a partial refund was denied. The points system is a joke too unless you travel often (more than 3 times a year) and/or outside your country. I was a loyal customer for several years, but never again. This company puts profits over people. | Easy and efficient.y | Good website to navigate, and customer service, prices are very competitive. | grateful to off found you | Easy to reserve, pick-up and drop-off. | My go-to to book ANY trip! | Don't like their return policy and can be run around in order to get a refund or credit. | never a glitch always great deals | wow | I normally fly with jetblue, but on occasion, I find better prices in Expedia. | fantastic, i uses for all my travels!!! ufff | Beautiful everything was perfect | Cannot beet the savings❣️ | love it | 95% of the time, Expedia offers the best prices period! Customer service is top notch! The bundling option saves so much money! I go to Expedia 1st, then I check everybody else, and then, I'm right back with Expedia. | Amazing App. Has saved me a lot of $$$ | Not able to login, tried several time....😢🥺 | Easy as pick, and click, click, done | great customer service and best prices with reliable airlines and hotels! | great and easy | Been using Expedia for years. Easy to use app and good prices. | Easy booking. Thanks | I can't search flights. I type the city but nothing happen | great | reliable | was awesome, little effort 👌 | I can no longer log in. The app has stopped recognizing my Gmail account or my actual login credentials. Prior to this, I found the app very convenient, handy, and intuitive. I've booked a ton of trips through them. They web page still works fine. | wonderful comparisons | Been using Expedia to book flights, hotels, cars and packages for over 10 yrs. Never had any issues and customer service has always been helpful when I need them. I never use anything else. | I was quoted a price that went upon payment as apparently Expedia give you the motels price. They then on more to pay Expedia on top of this.. Cheaper not to use Expedia - no deals with them in fact costs more to use Expedia | Supper buggy can't book anything on this trash app | easy | Horrible app. makes errors on a regular basis.you will lose a lot of money if you try to book using this app. stay away. | I've been using Expedia for years. I always like how convenient and acceptable the prices are. really great for last minute searches and I've only needed to use assistance once and all of these years. | It's the original and still the best travel booking app in my opinion. Enough said. | very easy to book flights | Awesome site to use when planning trips. | poor on costumer service | prompted to | acceptable prices , customer friendly app. | Easy to work around | The puzzles to prove I was not a bot made the app unusable. I would get verified, the screen would load, and then go back to doing a puzzle to prove I wasn't a bot. The process just kept repeating like a glitch. I had it less than 24 hours and deleted it. | Used to love the app, hate the changes that were made and now it has logged me out and will NOT allow me to log back in to my account. I've cleared history/cashe, I've rebooted my phone and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and nothing works. Very unhappy with this app right now. | Half the time the app won't let me enter a destination for a hotel search making it utterly useless. | 👍🏽 | Only lets you choose a 29 day window, if you like to go somewhere for more than a few weeks then you can't do it through this site. Also, prices are cheaper individually (through hotel directly and flight directly through their own sites) for the same dates and locations. Two stars because I used to enjoy this site when I didn't know how to book different aspects of my travel for myself but now it's not something I'll use because there are better prices to be found with little research. | unable to connect the trip itinerary from website to app, will probably just continue to use the website | easy to use | hard to navigate, won't keep my current screen open | Best App for Flights and Hotels | I love it ❤️ | love that I can easily cancel as needed. | easy and life saving | The app isn't working. Everytime I sign in it freezes. | I love how Expedia fine great hotels | Expedia used to protect and support customers when booking through them. I used them since the beginning. Nowadays, we get to our Destination and find out about all of the additional, non disclosed fees such as that 50USD cleaning fee per day. From now on, I'll be booking everything myself to avoid surprises. | excellent app | Excellent fare choices and prices! | I only use expedia! for domestic AND international travel. | Easy to use app. Great way to find accommodation quickly. | I love discounts and convenience, especially when making last-minute plans. | setup hotel stay for vacation. last year. When the time to go came, I came down with a case of covid. but had no problem changing reservations. | very good | ease of use | No good. | thanks for training Expedia😀 | cheap, quick, easy | Easy to use, good information on web site. | Expedia has saved me money a few times especially on last minute issues. | love Expedia. | love it | easy to use","{""1"":7971,""2"":2006,""3"":9348,""4"":71138,""5"":506768}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Expedia","9168645875493882147","support@expedia.com","https://www.expedia.com/service/","1111 Expedia Group Wy W,

Easy to add personalized things. I have the paid version. | Excellent app, it does the job as expected. | I paid for this app but it wouldn't allow me to add items to the packing list. Every time I tried, the app crashed and closed. I was never able to make my packing list with this app and I forgot to pack a few things! I'm not happy. | Very essential | Very user-friendly | Great app for any type of checklist! | I really like it | Great idea. The app won't allow me to select just 1 clothing item... it's zero items or more than 2... I deleted the app. | Easy to use | It is nice for a basic, single city trip. However, there is no way to create a single packing list for a multiple city trip that could include one place cold and rainy and another that's warm and sunny. I wish I could type in multiple destinations with there dates and come up with a unified list. | Can't add to list, app just closes | Why does the past packing list go away?? Why not let us decide to keep it or not. Also no option to select between male / female | How to add counters for customised items to specify the count? | I wouldn't buy it again. Too buggy. If you update template it doesn't update the trip. If you update trip there is no way to update template. There is no search options. If doesn't recognize the place it just picks whatever the app want to choose. | Make packing easier | Crashed every time I added an item but still really cool if their last is perfect. It's auto generated after filling out some questions. Really cool. Never mind, I changed to 5 stars. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which resolved my issue. It works great now | Helped me think of things that I hadn't thought of. | A nice app to help you organize your packing before a trip. Love how you can customize to fit your needs. | This was a godsend as I was packing for my trip. Because of this app, nothing was forgotten that I had to go out and purchase. I also used it again for my trip back home, so I was sure I didn't forget anything there. In the end, I am confident this could potentially be labeled as a money saver! I love this app!! | Covers all necessities | This is my favorite packing app... It is perfect 10 /10. | It's a life (and luggage space) saver | Can only use for 1 location. Very disappointed | Must try | So helpful with all the travel we do. This app really helps ease my packing anxiety! | Super easy and complete! And fun to use. | It's legit. I always struggle at the last minute to remember everything but this generates a check list for you in seconds | This app is very helpful. Since I travel with my dog, I would like to have a way to remind me what to pack for him. Other than that, it's a great app. | Very Nice And Helpful for Travelers, Easy to use | I used to love this app but it's no longer reliable. Items keep disappearing off the list for not reason, then you end up forgetting things. | Easy to use... | It is very helpful when it comes to packing but some things may be annoying to other like the sound effects. Overall i belive this is a good app | The edit and delete buttons overlay the quantity button and are very glitchy | I do really like this app, but honestly I'm only doing the review as the constant 'rate the app' pop ups are really annoying me 🥲😅 | Great app | So far so good! | Good app - best packing app I've been able to find. Please make it possible to rearrange the activities once they're in your list. ie. I prefer to have ""clothes"" at the top, then ""toiletries"" then ""electronics"" but it just places them in whatever order it wants. | Lack of support after purchasing the app. I had purchased this app on a different phone. When I installed it on a new phone the purchase didn't transfer. Tried contacting support several times without success. I switched to a different app. | Goood | Helpful app, haven't forgotten anything using this. | This app is definitely not as customisable as one would hope/expect in the paid version. | Great, easy to use app | Great app. Love it had location | Very thorough list | Easy to use. Very useful! | Really handy. Use for all trips. Just purcahsed the full version and custom lists are so useful. | Useful | Useless | Even after trying many times, adding stuff doesn't work. And when I delete things or mark them done, they come back! It's really annoying and makes using the app not uaeful at all. | Good covering all items | In App upgrade doesn't work. Money wasted. | It keeps deleting things I've added to my list. Maybe it's just me being a noobie. But the idea is not to forget anything. How can I do that if it deletes it without my knowledge. | An app that makes packing easy | Very cool | Very nice app | Used to love this app but now unusable due to bugs that prevent saving changes to templates. Only half the items added appear and some are randomly deleted from the template and from the trip packing list itself. | Easy to use Great prepopulated categories. Good price if you need to customize it | I've bought it but it doesn't work. When I add a new item on the list it shuts down. I would like to be refunded please. | Very helpful! | Very helpful I have a tendency to forget get all the stuff helps a lot | I really wanted to live this, even paid for the app. However, it does not save what new items I add to the list. ☹️ | Used to like it but a bug has made it unusable I was using this app often and found it very handy but recently I cannot add additional items to the lists because ever time I do the app crashes. This had made the app unusable for me which is disappointing. | Good guide for planning your trip | Kept removing things from my list on it's own | The free version at least is not customizable at all so it's kind of useless | Keeps crashing within a minute. Also lack of multi destination makes it very inefficient. I'll be asking for a reimbursement. | Superb | Very useful | Very useful for keeping track of what to pack | It has a lot of useful items and you can add your special items! Easy to use. | Great | Good app so far. | Easy to use, very thorough. | Good, does what it should even the free version | A good reminder | Very handy. Use it before every trip. Love that I can add custom items and change the order of the items in the pre-built lists (in the free version). I do wish I could change the order of the entire category lists. If I've chosen Working, it always appears as the first list even through I'd rather Essentials and Toiletries were first. | So helpful!!!! | Zero support! They never respond. Too bad. With a few improvements to editing as others have also asked for, this could be a nice 5 star app. | Helps you remember the little things. Used to pack things weeks before and list reminds you what you put in bag already | Nice app. Very helpful. Would be better if you could print the list. | Absolutely love this app. Easy to add new items (with premium) but only add them directly to the main list of you wish them to be temporary. If you want them to be permanent you can check on our off for present and future travel, scroll to the bottom to ""customize packing templates"" and add things there you permanently want on your packing lists. So smooth. I will use this app for years. Much better than my previous one and I love that you can customize for various types of travel. Perfect. ☺ | Best app for packing | Wonderful app. It helps you not forget anything when packing! | Essential for traveling | Limited editing options without upgrade. Items you add to the preset lists often disappear. | I love pack point I just wish I could add my own activites and customize my pack template 🤔🤷‍♀️ | Ready made lists for easy packing. No more oops, I forgot to pack... | Honestly this was just a waste of time. You have to buy premium just to add more dtuff as this is just ai generated. | Now they removed the swipe action so I can't remove the unnecessary items in the list, do I have to customise my list every time before the trip? That just don't make sense | Even after purchasing the app, no edits to the default lists will save. If you remove them to recreate them with your own items, the icons are not selectable (i.e. the toothbrush). There is no way to edit trip information if you make a mistake.

Empowering paid users while letting free users use the app. One of the few apps I would recommend buying the ""for life license"". | I really wanted to like this, but there are quite a few issues with it. First of all, the ability to add categories and pictures of your receipts are only available to premium subscribers. These are free in a lot of similar apps. Also, the total calculations are incorrect. I checked and double-checked my numbers, added them up on a calculator but they did not match the total in the app. I wouldn't mind spending a few dollars total, but not per month for the app. The pricing is ridiculous. | top! | Hi how do I able to see how much my friends owe me and how much i pay for the trips? | multiple currencies good categories and summaries. | great app | My favorite app for travel. Setting budgets and tracking every dime is perfect ❤️ | Easy to use, and simplifies expense tracking | great | Great for tracking. I only used the free version but wished I had purchased it at the beginning of my trip as the value of the premium features only became more and more apparent toward the end of my trip, as you start to look at and analyze the data. Good job developers! | so nice!! | This app is almost perfect but it's missing some key features that I was looking for. - Cash remaining: I could not find anything that let's me set a starting amount of cash that I have, ATM deposits and how much cash I have remaining so that I can reconcile it with the cash I count at the end of the day. This is a critically important feature to me. - Multiple currency cash buckets. On many trips I have to manage multiple cash buckets in different currencies USD, EUR, local etc. | I've used this in several countries and it's great for keeping track of my expenses especially when I'm paying for everything in cash. The categories are easy to sort and I can tell at a glance what I'm spending money on and where I've spent most of my money on my multi country trip. The only issue I've had so far is with formatting when I export it as a spreadsheet which is easy enough to fix just annoying. | a great application | Great app. Very handy and useful! I miss only a few more filters at the statistics, but apart from that, it's an absolute gem. | love, love, love it. the premium version is 100% worth it. I even use it for my everyday life expenses | Fantastic method of watching your spending. It helps to budget and plan and gives me a feeling of comfort that I am not overspending. There's even space for giving me a well deserved treat every now and again | Great little app to keep track of your travel expenditures. I would love to buy the full version of the app but it's ridiculously expensive (~$80). Please make it more affordable 🙏🏻. | I absolutely love this app!!! | Terrific way to keep up with what you are spending and what you are spending money on during your trip. Very easy to use | great a | Amazing app for trips of any length. Many thanks to the developers! You've done an incredible job :) | Helpfull app to track travel expenses. Much appreciated. My suggestion for the paid version: the extra features should also become available for the travel partner/family member . I.e. On a multi country travel I wanted to make trips per country to see daily averages etc. but that could not work unless my partners buys the same paid version (for this price that seem to high for me). For now I would not see a benefit for the paid version. | Hi, Used the app during a recent trip with group of friends, does the division of expenses quickly and efficiently. Once location is enabled automatically converts expenses to base currency, which is a blessing. Overall a great app. PS: using the Pro version as subscription only during travels( as infrequent travels,) | $81!!!!! Entries are fairly user friendly but almost no search functionality without a onetime payment of $81! You have to scroll through EVERY SINGLE ENTRY to find the day you did x activity or search the name of the hotel it costs money. One month access is available for $6. I was stunned. I originally liked the app and went to pay for the full feature version expecting it to be $5-8 and I was flabbergasted. Without search I don't recommend. Free options have more functionality. | Wow!! | Very nice | looks like a great app | Invite people is not working. People are not able to join the trip with invite link. | best app for travel expenses | Good app | This app is perfect for traveling with family and friends and keeping track of expenses. I spent 17 days in Greece with 6 other people and it made it so easy to go to dinner each night, for example, and not have to fumble through separate checks or to take a cab from the airport and settle up afterwards. I even used it on a cross-country RV trip to split costs with my travel partner. So easy and convenient! | this app is super, I started to use this app to manage my 15 days' expenses. | nice app | This app was invaluable to me and my boyfriend as we spent 2023 travelling the world. It really helped us keep track of the budget and we loved all the stats. Very easy to use. | the Subscription page takes forerver to load and i cannot proceed payment, such a shame | great stuff | loving it so far.. super easy to use.. just wish the free version wpuld allow to create more categories. | good app for apportion | great | excellent app for tracking spending | Excellent 👍 | good | ok, but nothing special. I have switched to another one | Very useful apps | Great app to use for tracking your budget while on travel. | The app is broken. When I tried to enter again, I got a welcome message to travelspend 2.0. Now the app doesn't open, anything is working. | can't imagine traveling without this. makes budget tracking so easy! | To expensive for daily use | It is a really nice app with good features, they are handy and useful, the design is also nice. But for me (as a student), the price is really high and I can't afford it. Except that everything looks good, however there is always room for improvement. | love this app. it has allowed us to track our expenses while traveling. this a great budget tool, even if you are not traveling. | Love this app, love the photo attach for each entry, export to spreadsheet, etc, etc, etc - just great all around. | Can't login, update issue..... | Downloaded the app and set up two trips. Without warning one of the pots has been deactivated and they are demanding premium to even look what was in it. This was not a free trial that expired as they are now offering me a free trial to open that trip again. Edit: you are saying it was due to the free version. I did not take out any free trial and was allowed to make multiple trips without telling me one would later be locked | Great app for tracking spend while travelling, have been using the premium version for last 4 months travelling and love it. Really easy to use and has all the features you need ! | Needs premium subscriptionor one time payment of $60 to access older travel data I painstakingly inputted. I don't need the rest of the premium features, just that. I know how these apps work, but restricting access to old data without premium is just too much. Deleted. | best travel budget app | I loved this app but I can no longer add new entries it crashes everytime even after a reinstall. | Tuesday, 15 August 2023 at 19:20 [BST] / Dear Sir or Madam, Subject: software - 'TravelSpend: Travel Budget App' - In 2019, in 2020, in 2021 and on 25 August 2022 I have paid for ""Yearly Premium Subscription' - my previous holiday travel budget expenses have (automatically by the software) disappeared from the software - therefore there is a fault with the software - please reinstate my previous expenses (before my next payment is due on 25 August 2023). Regards, Sandra Montisci, London, UK | Really helpful to track how much we spend on holiday across various payments methods...just when you then you only spent x, its actually xxx 🤑 | The only travel app that I use everyday apart from google maps. Amazing customer service, too! They immediately solved my migration issues when I had issues with my google account. Best app to use to keep track of all travel expenses | I started using this app 2 years ago. And it was good. Now it's pretty much unusable with all the recent ""updates"" way to ruin a good thing. | Very useful app to manage in detail all travel cost. | This app was the best untill the update. Me and my boyfriend used it every day whilst travelling and it helped to keep our budget in check. However a lot of the features I used every day have now been removed since the update. In particular daily and total remaining budget figures. Also simple things such as keyboard alignment have been completely broken for weeks now. All of which I had emailed photos of but have still not yet been resolved. It would be great if these could be added back in. | I used the app for 7 days then it stopped working. I was very annoyed that it is ""free"" for a 7 day trial only, then they want way too much $. Nowhere is it stated when you use it that it is a 7 day trial for free. This should be stated clearly when you download it. I would be happy to pay a smaller fee as it was very easy to use, but feel the way they have hidden the cost is very misleading and its way too expensive for what it is. | Since the new update I can't put in my expenses in the right way. When I want to enter for example 0,70RM (Ringet) it automatically change in something totally different. I need to enter like 1RM to get close to the right expense. Since it can not see expenses with commas. | I used to love this app, but the new update seems like a regression. If I look at an old trip and then forget to move to my current one it will allow me to add entries, even though the dates of the old trip are passed (the old version would not allow this). The new version also doesn't add a nice little picture automatically to a trip like the old one did, and it just all around seems a little slower and wonky. I wish I never updated... | We just spent 7 months in SE Asia, and this app was great for keeping us under budget. The app would sync on our phones almost immediately. It Made it easy for the two of us to know what the other had spent, | Reported bugs for 2.0 were fixed in a week. Good support 👏 | Since the update that I got today I lost one of my budgets, my other budget is not correct anymore amounts make absolutely no sense, 2 months of accounts ruined. | Love this app. Keeping track of costs is easy and especially helpful when sharing expenses. | Used to really like this app but since the update it keeps crushing and is borderline unusable | Just doubled the premium prices... I always thought about getting the premium version just to get some more stats and sorting functionality, but this will not happen anymore..!😃 Greedy developers. They just did a redesign which is btw not that good that it justified raising the price by 100%. But as base app itself is alright and fullfils the purpose. | great app to enter all the travel spends by day, categories and it convert everything to your own currency! it also gives you statistics of your spends which are great visuals! awesome app for travellers who wanba keep track of their expenses | Use for travel and home, can't do without it now! Keeps me in control of funds and gives me a huge insight into categories of spend! Also can keep all year on year records and see how they fluctuateI L O V E IT! 5***** Development point - would love a monthly copy page and paste option!... | great app keeps a tab on everything | Can't login with Google. Can't create an account with my e-mail account, it says already registered, resetted password and still can't login. | I love this app! So easy! I've been using it for years. Plus, it's free, no Ads, please never change! | really great app to keep track of travel finances | It closes automatically everytime you use wifi or data. | amazing app has everything I need to budget my travels. also the team are brilliant they helped me out when I thought I lost my data, were very helpful and quick to reply on email, thanks guys! I recommend this app to everyone who wants to budget on their travels | Good | Good but missing a huge feature. I wish it could just show me MY spending when I'm logging expenses for a party. Because it doesn't fully slice and dice this way, it's always hard to keep track of my personal budget I've input, it tracks ALL expenses fully against MY budget. But so far it feels like the best app for tracking travel spending, really good UI and once I figured out how the party split worked, easy to see who owes what. However another gap is when you click to settle debts | I like the app. However I have some issues when trying to set the picture for a vacation. I cannot click pe button when I am in portrait mode on a S10 Plus and when I turn the phone in lanscape mode and I set the cover image, after that when I turn the phone back in portrait mode the image is lost. | I paid for the full version because I wanted to take photo of my receipts. However the app is unable to access camera for pixel android version even after I have changed permissions. Hope I can get a refund.. | It works well for me | I love it | Conversions are wrong - ended up £600 over my budget. When comparing how much the app inputs compared to cash withdrawals (what shows on my banking app) including withdrawal fees, the app is showing less, meaning I'm now £600 short. I would avoid using this app now. | Fantastic way to record expenses, so you can budget for further holidays.

"Transit • Subway & Bus Times","Transit is your real-time urban travel companion. Open the app to instantly see accurate next departure times, track buses and trains near you on the map, and see upcoming transit schedules. Use the trip planner to quickly compare trips - including options like bus and bike, or metro and subway. Get alerted about service disruptions and delays for your favorite lines, and save frequently used locations for trip directions in a tap. 

HERE’S WHAT THEY’RE SAYING
""Gives you the best route to where you want to go"" - New York Times
“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times
“Killer app” - Wall Street Journal
""MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit"" - Boston Globe
“A one-stop-shop” - Washington Post

AND HERE’S THE WORD FROM PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS
“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car.”
“Blows Google Maps out of the water.”
“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”

 6 GREAT THINGS ABOUT TRANSIT:

1) The best real-time data. 
The app uses the best transit agency data sources like MTA Bus Time, MTA Train Time, NJ Transit MyBus, SF MUNI Next Bus, CTA Bus Tracker, WMATA Next Arrivals, SEPTA Real-Time and many more. We combine that data with our fancy ETA prediction engine so that you get the most accurate real-time info possible for all transit modes -  including buses, subways, trains, streetcars, metros, ferries, ridehail and more. Prefer to travel on two wheels? With GPS, you can see live bikeshare and scooter locations right on the map. 

2) Travel offline
Bus schedules, stop locations, subway maps and even our trip planner are available offline.

3) Powerful trip planning
See fast and easy trips combining buses, subways and trains – the app even suggests routes that combine multiple options in one trip like bus + bike or scooter + metro. You’ll find great trip plans that you never even considered! Don’t like to walk a lot or use a certain mode or transit agency? Personalize your travel in the settings.  

4) GO: our step-by-step navigator*
Receive departure alarms to catch your bus or train, and get alerted when it’s time to get off or transfer. When using GO, you’ll also crowdsource more accurate info and real-time ETAs for other passengers– and rack up points and thank yous for being the most helpful rider on your line.  

5) User Reports
See what other riders have to say! With millions of users contributing, you’ll get helpful info on crowding levels, on-time performance, the closest subway exits, and more.

6) Easy Payments
Pay your transit fare and buy bikeshare passes directly in the app in over 75 cities.

Make me miss my connection. | Very well done | Difficult to see arrival times for buses. Difficult to navigate. Difficult to differentiate decipher the interface. Displays the Wwrong times for buses. Doesn't accurately track buses location. Ordered an Uber instead. | Excellent app. very helpful. so glad belleville transit uses it. | It's just what I needed to do what I need to do | It never opens!!!!! Wth | trying to make it hook up to token transit app. for payment. | Not intuitive enough yet. Takes time to figure out necessary features. | Pretty Decent 🤤 | manipulation | Not liking the fact that they collect our personal info outside of location and no option to select that they do not do this 🙄😡 | This app has been screwing me over for weeks and I'm getting really tired of it. I'll leave 10 mins before Transit tells me to head out for a route, and when I check again a few mins later, it tells me I should have left 10 mins earlier than that for the same route. This app is singlehandedly threatening me keeping my job because it's constantly making me late by showing inaccurate route info. This app is almost pointless like this, I might as well just wing it. Please do something about this. | Tells me the bus coming in real time, Honolulu, Hawaii,stay blessed. | App unreliable when you select more than 60mins of future trip. The timer freezes. Thanks for making me miss my bus. | Great app.. | Easily, hands down, the best app for navigating urban transit systems. Recently used it in Christchurch, Auckland in New Zealand and Paris. Very accurate and clear! | good | This app is a must if you take the bus or train in any major city. I live in las vegas and its a life saver for finding which buses are running | bus was exactly where marked. Blew by bus stop without slowing? | Half the appeal is gone, since you can't see the bus icon until you get on the bus, which at that point I don't need to know where it is. I do like that it has user input, but I doubt anyone actually looks at our responses. also arrival times can differ drastically from what the app lists | this was a pleasant ride also the train was extremely clean | God bless you for allowing me the free Royale subscription! Thank you so much it's great! | Works okay, but won't let me look for other locations if I'm not near that location. | 👍 | Good app | Great bus schedule app! | Awesome | It seems (at least on Android 13) you have to grant access to your location in order for the app to be usable. When it asks for location and I tap ""Maybe later"" (on the app itself, not a pop-up) it then crashes when I try to search for anything. But if I grant imprecise location and then revoke this permission in Android settings, the app works just fine. I have emailed Transit with more details so hopefully they can fix this. | kinda confusing at first but you can get the hang of it. | Love the experience | outdated LAX shuttle to Aviation. shuttle between C-Aviation and K- Winchester. graphic good, can improve | Very efficient and accurate app. | JOSEPHREYESRIVERA | Transit is my number 1 mass transit everything app! This app does it all for my trip planning, bus and light rail line riding and does an outstanding job of letting me know when the next bus will arrive; it will even show approximately how full that bus is. But, if I need to walk instead of use a bus or train it can help with that. While I don't use it for bicycles or scooters because I am severely visually impaired, this app can handle those options too. THANK YOU, TRANSIT! | I was gifted a free sub thanks so much | It's supposed to do one thing and it can't even do that. Busses just disappear from the list, meaning you can't find the info that this is supposed to provide. Pin a bus? Still doesn't show up. But you can see all types of busses that you'll never remotely be interested in. Completely useless. | the gps accuracy was on point good app so far so good | one of the best apps | Always on Time 😉 | App worked great until this week. It now shows no busses or times for my area. Setting a destination shows only 1 route which doesnt even offer the bus I actually take. Whatever changes were recently made has rendered this app useless. | Very convenient to use in California. | The best app, very accurate bus times, never miss your bus | Pretty good for navigation, the ticket purchasing EZfare thing is rough though. Doesn't allow one letter names, doesn't accept Discover credit. I've also had to restart the app to get it to work at all. Considering ticket purchasing might be done in a rush that's pretty bad. Also what's the deal with offering more routes for a fee? Edit: This has been steadily improving I think. Payment seems better. Royale is included for everyone in my city now, but I guess it made sense as a funding source. | needs improvement | good | The best! | love it. The only thing needed is a tutorial on how to use it. I love how you can pay and keep your ticket online instead of having to keep up with a paper app. | It's so off. It is an accurate Google Maps is more accurate. | ,rGreat app always with reliable Info | this app is great if you ride a bus 🚌 | is so nice | It sucks so bad. It's not user friendly at all and the info doesn't match up with the website half the time. It is difficult to use and navigate and I hate it with a burning passion | I only downloaded this app because I was told I could buy tickets on here (for UTA Salt Lake). For the life of me I can't find where to do that in the app. I've been looking for 20 minutes. Either I was misinformed or the UI is just that bad | great service and even connected me with uber for free | I hate apps that ask for ratings. if you are good I'll tell everyone | It's a shame how this app blocked critical information about transport lines behind a pay wall. It used to be a really good app. | I would give 5 star ratings but the app won't let me add money to my transit account. The app is literally only good for looking up the bus. I would like to continue using my transit account but won't let me add money. All it keeps saying is something went wrong sorry about that try again in a sec. Please fix bug⚠️ | Very efficient app. | Tracking is never correct, several times it has told me my bus already passed the stop only for the bus to arrive minutes later. Horrible experiences. | Evertime I try to provide access to my account it keeps saying wait one second and doesn't let me sign in | need to not be excluding functions and lack cyber security | best bus service | was good until they started monetizing everything and now any app is better than this if you dont pay | Good app | nice app | Great app mostly accurate but it has its bugs | best transit app there is | Silver spring | App opens, I click on destination such as work, app closes. No other functions exist. | I've got to the bus stop on Franklin and 38th Street going to Julia Clarkson Transit center and there was no bus until I got on the other side of 465 going west from the 38th Street | Not only was my bus ride today free, nos. 20 and 11, but the very kind driver on the 11 this evening dropped me right at a stop by my airport hotel, saving me a roundabout shuttle trip. Wonderful service, very gracious people, both customers and staff. | Horrible app, times are not accurate, and they decided to change to all black text instead of white, thanks for thinking of the visually impaired your morons. | Helps me alot | Not sure why my new review is gone. This app is behaving weirdly. It's plotting routes that is far from me and eventually makes me late. | never have problems with it | Mostly buses late | I've always gives you correct information on bus or train arrival great app to have | The go Raleigh call center is very rude and unprofessional they keep hanging up on us I'm trying to get my kids to school now they're gonna miss today because I was tryna get the time the number 18 comes and this lady hangs up on me TWICE!!!!! NOW IM PISSED 😡😡😡😡😡 they need to pay attention and monitor they're workers | perfection! | usually pretty accurate | This app is the best way to find your way through any city in the country. | Never accurate | better than the other apps and more useful | I really appreciate that the app works for all the bus lines in metro Detroit with a 99% accuracy... I've been unemployed for sometime now and it was very easy to get upgraded to Royale. Thanks to the team at transit app! I applaud you for all of your help and generosity in making commuting easier for all... | Takes too long to load I'm on the bus 15 minutes | I can't even put my email info in to make a account. It keep saying sorry wait one second | Accurate time. | I want Trasit App. in my new phone. | Very accurate most of the time. | the app is outstanding 😃 | Pretty Cool 😎 | great app. really helpful and easy to use 😄 | This is a great app if you make connections en route on Minneapolis busses. It shows real-time tracking of the route options related to your GPS position. It gives timing and shows GPS position of routes that cross your path. It does only show you the immediate surrounding route info for free. A workaround is to drag your map position to the desired connection point for info at that location. | Nice app | It just crashes when searching anything | hard to get what u want to see | 7 st Laurent which passed at 11.06 pm he didn't even stop the bus at the stop very bad experience | Haven't had many issues with this app however I really really wish you could change the language as English is not my native language... | good luck app | It just told me there was no route from w95th and Lorain to w117th and Lorain. It seems to have lost 22 route in Cleveland. Also, frequently yells at me for having weak GPS.

It wouldn't let me book anything and i couldnt proceed without logging in but your app is very quick and easy to use. Thank you | Great tours. Free cancellation has helped alot in the past. Easy to use | I've used GetYourGuide in Spain, Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Scotland, Norway, Svalbard, Japan, Korea, across the US, Mexico, the Caribbean, and more. Super easy to use, super easy to book, and I've never had an issue. | My guide did not show and they refused to refund my money. | Great app for all your vacation needs | Adequate at best. Arbitrary, capricious, even deceptive in the descriptions. Read every, last, word, in, every, section. Or you end up with a worthless product. for example audio tour for a museum you cannot enter because you thought you were getting museum access. spoke to customer service 5 mins after purchase and no luck. paid over 500 euro to them I just the last few days and they cannot figure out how to refund 23 euro? silly, tonedeaf, incompetent. Spoke to Romel. | Dali Museum, guide exceptional | So easy to use and so much variety. | Great deals, fantastic app To show us around Venice 😺 | Great app with detailed information. | Very helpful in planning last-minute activities on a solo trip | Bucks due to very slow response to issues | Some tours are complete SCAMS! No tour guide ever showed up. We waited for over 30 minutes. Roso Travel activity provider is a SCAMMER. I improved the raiting from 1 to 5 stars for GetYourGuide. The sum of more than 500 Eur for the fake Roso Travel activity has been refunded. Thank you, GetYourGuide! | Great app, very useful | Very easy to use app | Anywhere, anytime always getyourguide. | Love it! | Great app, very useful! No ads. | Am new here just trying as a supplier | used twice, Granada and Tangier, great experiences | Great guide at the Coliseum. Thank you Teddie | Dreadful and you can't download your tickets | App is terrible, bought a great offer but the app constantly asks me to sign in, when I do it often just takes me back to the sign in page with no messages why. Scrolled through the app, requested to sign, I did but I don't think it was successful, then tried to add a favourite activity, had to sign in, was asked to make a list, went to create a list, app say opps can't do that now try again later, try again, asked to sign. Quick note I did sign in each time it asked but it never seemed to work | Constantly asks to re-login, never succeeds | Impossible to stay logged in. Logs in and shows my account for a millisecond before asking me to log in again. Tried multiple devices, apps, accounts, everything. Customer support said they didn't have the resources to troubleshoot it and the promo code only works on the app. Excellent way to get every email I own signed up to your service, I suppose. Easier to book directly with the tour operator. | They have more choices than others. | Reserved tickets to Colosseum in Rome. It was very pleasant experience | Very easy to use and explains and advise you on what's there to see. Excellent. | Great for finding and planning in one place. | Easy to use and all tickets in one place | Best experience | Works well.

Visiting Lisbon for the first time. They have a wide variety of options, well categorized and described. | Really useful for planning excursions last minute | Great app for buying tickets for attraction. | Nice to be able to book tours, museums and transfers all in one place | Easy to use | Discovering New Orleans just got a whole lot easier! This amazing app was our ultimate guide on our first trip to the Big Easy, serving up a wealth of expert suggestions and insider tips. With so many amazing experiences to choose from, we were spoiled for choice! What really made our trip unforgettable was the seamless booking process, detailed activity descriptions, turn-by-turn directions, and timely reminders, all at our fingertips.

Like the terms as well. | Easy to find and book tours. | Perfect ap | Easy Peasy | The activity provider/trader mislead using pictures and description that scams you. so please check what your activity provider does. and they blame the app for not giving them an option. | We should be able to edit our review after submiting it. I started a review, than stopped for doing something else and then i wasn't able to finish it. | Had to cancel and rebook my reservation because I didn't choose accommodations. The customer service was excellent. Great job and thank you. | All is easy to pick, to reserve, to pay | Awesome | was never able to complete a single purchase, error code 100 whatever before making payments... costumer service is useless and asked personal information like last for digits of credit card, date of birth etc... and 3 days later never heard from them it seems like a big personal information collector scheme or a scam. beware | I have used get your guide in 4 cities in the past 2 weeks, the app is great for keeping all the info I need close at hand. | Lots of options, easy to book | Love the app, makes it so easy make tour bookings | Great app when looking for adventures traveling alone, or in group! | Easy booking and very detailed descriptions that live up to in reality. | Booked two great guided tours through this all 1 Vesuvio and Pompei . 2. Napoli sotto terra EASY !!!!! PEASY!!!! | Value for money on all your travel needs | Gives lots of info and easy to use. | solid and secure | So user friendly 👍 | Everything works. | Easy and excellent | Pointless app. Extremely fed up of companies thinking they need an app when a simple email will suffice. After booking my tour I received an email saying I would need the app to access the activity. So I had to download and install the app. But all the information was already in the email. I didn't need or use the app at all, and the tour company never once looked at it. Have now uninstalled on return home. | So fast! | A great choice of trips and things to do,very easy to use | I was told that the app was required for the trip. Using the directions took me to the wrong location, and I almost missed the boat. When I tried to board the boat using the QR code in the app, I was turned away and forced to go get a paper ticket. | Quick and easy to use | So far, so good.

Just getting together remaining shots before we print our book. | So far, so good! Folk want to visit my blog but don't want to sign up to FP to read it. | I'm not sure if it is a bug, but for me, its ""optimised"" tracker consumes way too much battery. To be more specific for Samsung S23U on recent trip just over the course of an hour or two it consumed 7% when it wasn't opened a single time (tracker in the beginning of the trip was set to balanced). For the perspective, it is a similar amount to whatsapp consumption, except whatsapp was actively used to make video calls this time. Can't put a positive mark if it is like that. | An excellent app! My neighbor turned me on to it and the travel book He showed us was both beautiful and reasonable in price! | It is very good and helps to remember the memories and order of the trip. I wish I could upload more videos | Great guys ! Hoping to follow their adventures | Love using this app when traveling. More secure than FB. | Great App to Create, Safe, and share your most exciting experiences with friends and family. I love this app! User-friendly and not intrusive. | Difficult to use. No clear instructions. | Love this app! We primarily use it as a diary of our trips and travels, and if people want to follow us, that's all good. | Love this app. Its so easy and fun. | Still new to the app hence only 4 stars 😊 | great travel tool | awesome travel app! | really like how this app tracked my travels and made a great chronological path of where I went. it's a brilliant way remember a holiday. and best of all it's free! please don't change this app | Used for the first time and it is great do far. | There is no list of countries u can simply select from, and ""complete your places"" is not accurate. Florence, Munich, and many other cities are showing up is something else. | very good app. the uploads can be frustratingly slow and it would be even better if it offered in-app editing of pics | Awesome app to blog your travels. Looking forward to using this going forward | Very nice | This is a great app for a travel diary. One of the original and still right top of the hea. Being able to order a book is a bonus. | I really love this app. Easy to use, great for travelling (i like it a lot more than polarsteps!) I'm using it to track my world travel (premium account). It has everything i need. There is a limitation of 20 pictures per entry and sometimes i'm struggling to choose from all the photos i'll take but actually it's better to have a limit so the entry is not overloaded! Big plus: you can do captions! | Absolute rubbish. Couldn't locate the countries or cities I was recording as visited.. Came up as totally different places. | love this app like that you can add another person to the trip! only wish you could 👍🏻❤️ peoples comments on your picture! | Brilliant way to travelogue. So easy to push a photo into the journal and update later. | This app is great. So far, so good. I am really curious to see the manner in which the photo album is assembled and its quality. If this process is comparable to the the initial creation, it will be very good! | Really easy to use - as someone who doesn't use much social media, this was a really nice way for family and friends to follow our trip across Asia | The family loves it. Great for extended family to follow what we're up to. | Very easy to use and stores all the info that I need. | really like this app for a mixture of tracking, photos and story telling | It is easy to handle | It has potential. Multi traveler experience isnt that great. Had a traver delete my footprint and found no recyle bin. Not the easiest to navigate period. Concept is pretty good though | It's only day 3 using this, but I am struggling with it. Want to add more photos to day 1, but can't insert. Would like to add a screenshot to location. | Placed order over a week ago, no update, sent follow-up, no response. | Great app - kept a record of all our good memories. | Very nice app, I could post together with my boyfriend all infos and pictures of our travel. An upgrade I would really like: The possibility to upload the footprint as draft so that also other people that are taking part to the trip are able to modify the footprint draft, before actually posting it. A small bug I noticed: When you have 2 consequent videos in your footprint the first one cannot be played normally. | This program is so useful for keeping track of your travels and the photo books are beautiful . | We love being able to record our trips & add photos. The bonus is getting a book printed! | A great travellers app. shows a map and a time line and where photos were taken. | Good app, similar and perhaos improved over Polarsteps. I like that you can embed a part of your trip in your website. Also the facility to attach documents. I would like to be able to export all of my data and photos, basically as insurance - the one important feature Polarsteps has over this app. | Displays ads in your notifications (e.g. ""10% photo book discount""). Much worse, they are in the same notification category as new posts from your friends, so you can't disable them unless you also disable new posts notifications... This is really invasive. | enjoying it a lot | Super well done and easy to use. I would recommend adding an intermediate pricing between free (too cheap) and 30 USD per year (too much for the extra features). | I loved this app, works amazingly to share stories with families and friends. But now they've changed it so you have to pay to post anything of substance and it's quite expensive too. Will continue to use it for my current trip but not in future | Love this travel app! | Enjoying the app so far. | Really nice app, should add a parks/heritage sights/ unesco places chart | Nice | Early days, but so far, so good, easy to understand, and upload photos. | Great app. Stable and user friendly. If you don't do social media and want to keep your family updated while travelling this is the app for you. The book is great quality and effortless to make. | Lovely app for sharing travel adventures with family and friends. I especially liked that they didn't have to download the app or create an account, so even my mum could work it out and follow where I'd been and show the Footprints to her friends. The app itself is easy and quick to use, convenient to use offline until internet is available again and I liked only being able to upload 20 photos (and 2 videos) for each Footprint - it really made me focus on what I wanted to share. Thanks guys! | Inspiring | Fancy and well designed! But how do you communicate sustainability awareness while encouraging to travel the whole world (by plane)? Saving our habitat earth together should be a considerable collective focus as well these days, otherwise we can't really travel anymore at all soon enough 🌱✌️💙 | This app works well, even for an old guy like me! We are using it for travel and keeping track of our friends walking the Camino. | Fantastic app - and easy to make photo books. Actually very useful to catalogue pictures not only for traveling. | Great app for tracking journey and adding pics. | awesome app for tracking holiday pictures and places | Buggy buggy. Can't add followers. Sister had same issue. | My only issue is the narrow window to type in. Although it might be me. | Very good and easy to use. | LOVE LOVE LOVE the book I had made with FindPenguins after using their app on my last trip!! | Tracking and loading pictures is good, but it won't let me download Ebook despite paying Premium. Update. Thanks for your reply. Yes, 1 star was far too low. I'll try again but having spent a long time trying to get an Ebook without success it was frustrating. Further update. You have to switch on in app purchase to get your Premium membership even though you pay online. Not sure why it doesn't just update. ALL GOOD NOW. | Excellent and fun way to share an adventure | Great idea - a couple of improvements maybe. Need to be able to access all shared photos in shared Google photo albums and GPS tracking seems a bit flakey | App LOOKS very useful and exciting but does not work. I would pay for this app if the errors were fixed. | Does what it says it does really well, although prefer another app myself. But the exporting of videos does not offer a map view showing the steps and (EDIT: an animated) route between photos, so just not what I wanted unfortunately. | love it!!!! | Solid program, Great Book- high quality. The usability within a group, specifically connecting them to me was pain...and not well thought out. | Terrible, this app did not help me find even one penguin. I have never been more disappointed in an app | I found the app easy to use immediately. As I use it I discover more features that make it even better, such as being able to re-order the photos on a footprint. | Just started our trip yesterday...so far, so good! Looking forward to seeing it work for the entire trip! So excited! | This app was the best! It allowed me to keep my family and friends updated on my long trip overseas and also give me a chance to look back at my own trip once I was home. Would highly recommend. | Great app and you don't need data or wifi | Great app to cover your trips short or long. It tracks all places you go to thru location on your phone. You can add photos and comments aswell. You can also share what you put in the app. | Great app once you understand the procedure | Works great, so easy to use. Easy to change posts, add locations and pics. | Nonsense | Great | The app has been crashing when I click on countries. Other than that, fantastic way for me to track my own travels | good | I love this app!! I can keep all my trips here and share with my friends and family, also with other people arround the world | It is fantastic app I have seen. The print the trip is very cool and More loveable. I have one suggestion that the footprint connection is straight line can you make the line into travel root (like google map Show the way). | found it hard to invite people to follow us | generally good ap. I've been happy with it. The only thing it does poorly is find pictures in shared albums from google photos. If you are getting pictures from others, and want to put them in your feed, you basically have to make a local copy. | This app is a Fantastic and easy way to log your adventures and share with family and friends | Does not track penguins. | As a first time user, I don't encountered any problem currently but will review later when I get use to it. | A great tool for a travel blog. | As someone who is not on social media, I found this app to be very intuitive and easy to use. I'm loving it so far. I'd like to be able to put captions on the pictures though. Is there a way to do that? | Very easy to use. Good presentation. | amazing app for travelers | Really like this app. | Outstanding app. | tolle App um Reisen festzuhalten und mit anderen zu teilen. speziell die Kartenfunktion, mit Strecke und Footprints, finde ich super.
