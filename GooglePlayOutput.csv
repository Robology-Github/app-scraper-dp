Decent for checking out nearby restaurants and tourists attractions. | Best App for travel tips | Good | Good | I've used this app for years and it works great. It's an invaluable tool for finding nearby attractions and places to eat. | The app is easy to use. It helped me found hidden jems during my travels, amazing places to stay which sometimes aren't available on popular booking sites. I mainly use to search accomodations in specific areas, highly rated by other travellers. | Good handy app, but there should be a translate button so we can read all the reviews | this is very nice for fashionistas and models searching for places | Experiencia recomendable | Trust the reviews listed and i find it is good to read previous guests views as not everyone will like the same place. | So difficult to do things. TripAdvisor stupidly opened a new Google-linked account (without asking me) when I wrote a review and won't let me (1) revise or update the review or (2) merge the new account with my other account that I've had for 14 years (since the promised merge email that supposedly expires in an hour never arrives). So I'll have to delete my review and start again in the correct account. It's not possible to simply move a review. I've wasted so much time. | Very beneficial!! | Try it and you will surely find it the best for planning trips. | This is one of my favorite travel apps | Very bad it doesn't give business people an opportunity to talk about them regarding on other clients taking advantage in making a reputation for hard working like us a bad name for our even if we complain | So many places and so, so much information. We use it to get information and understand where we will visit. The information is invaluable. Thank you for the service and Thank you Contributors. | Always use the app to look at reviews before I book a holiday | Very professional | Most of the time it is spot on. Other travellers can be Muppets though | Used this app for a number of years and have always loved it but a recent update has changed the whole layout and I'm afraid it is unlikely I will continue to use it! | I recommend this app, cause it is very useful and easy to use. | I find that this app really fills the void of others. I like it because I can find tours, hotel transfers, accurate foodie reviews plus, wait for it, bloggers who will meet you and take you on a particular tour. And there are people in every country who do this. They may be pricier than ""Hop on- hop off"" buses, but you will see unique parts of whatever city you are in! | Would give this a higher rating but you can't edit reviews if you want to tweak them or see an error. You have to delete the entire review and do it over again. C'mon, in this age of technology, make it easy to edit a review. | I am Local tour guide in Tanzania and the App is incredibly amazing... i can share my reviews with pictures from different places i visited and help travellers make the good choices. | It is impossible to cancel a booking. The text they send you is a no reply and we only have WiFi at the hotel. I cancelled 3 days before the tour but they still sent me the ticket and charged me. | Very easy to use and love looking at other's reviews. | Easy handlimg, reliable source for finding nice places to eat, drink or stay! | The tours are amazing! | Easy to use | It's a great resource. I use Trip Advisor to find points of interest wherever I visit. Because the reviews are from fellow travelers, the information stays from that point of view not necessarily travel agents or venue owners. There's more practical information here. | This is amazing mobile app | very helpful wth everything 🙂 | Suoer | Easy to use | Took a break for sometimes as it wasn't user friendly for a while. Glad to check in again and it's nice to be back. Bravo. | It was working well, but now the save function is a bit broken. Keeps asking me to create a new trip when I just want to save to an existing trip | Bloatware | If we are going anywhere we always check Trip Advisor | Absolutely love it makes planning g and you will be using g this for everything you plan atrip | Para tener idea del lugar donde vas es bueno | This site is very important if you are the who like to travel and also if you want to be come business man cause TripAdvisor connect you to the world of joyfully | Very good | Reliable | this is very good and usefull apps. y | Great all-round app that helps you plan your social life! | Very trustworthy and reliable information | Good | Tripadvisor helps me plan my holidays. | My favorite review app. #teamTripAdvisor | Ok but reviews don't seem to be published initially | Amazing world travel expenses | Easy and informative | Excellent | I always use TripAdvisor to find a nice shop or restaurant, where ever I am. And I make sure to always write a fair and detailed review after most all of my visits. Good service and products deserve recognition. While poor service and products deserve to be criticised. | Nobody uses this anymore, everyone is using Google maps for reviews. It is a pleasure to witness TA demise. TA just wants to sell you hotels and trips now. Nothing in their reviews is to be trusted, most users are dumb as a rock and review hotels instead of the app itself. A dead app, good. Updated, no improvements. Fk tripadvisor and his board. | Excellent travel app! | Love trip adviser | Amazing | That's very well apps... and I believe in this app my earnings | Sangat mudah dioperasikan | Very usefull app. Thank you | Awesome and very helpful | I've been using Tripadvisor I must say, it's truly outstanding. The performance is flawless – it's fast, responsive, and incredibly reliable. I've never experienced any crashes or slowdowns, even when multitasking or using it for extended periods. The user interface is intuitive and well-designed, making navigation a breeze. Whether I'm accessing features or customizing settings, everything is neatly organized and easy to find. Plus, the app's sleek design adds to the | Good | Great place to find and compare everything for your travel's | I am new on this app it's look helpful for local guide. | Love Trip advisor... My go to app before trying somewhere new!! | Trip advisor is getting too strict about any one adding truth about businesses. I want to know all the bad and good about a hotel i need to stay at. I want to know the bad and good about a restaurant i want to eat at. | Very easy and reliable app. Good customer service and peace of mind for potential cancellations. | My photo session with ""Two Crafty Cats"" was fantastic, she I'd such a fantastic job, I would definitely recommend! | Excellent | We usually use this app if in an unfamiliar location. | Wonderful for an Old Man Trying To Keep Up | Good app | TripAdvisor is all we used when we travel because it helps us to understand in depth what are we booking and what do we need to have the best experience! 😜 | Booked 4 tours in PVR and all were a very smooth experience | Very useful tool | USALS couldn't even find the pub | Using for several years, Awesome, we traveled many may places, always had the inside scoop with TripAdvisor. Very often we felt like tour guides instead of tourists Everything App | Good and helpful | Easy to use | very good apps | Easy to use nd good for hotel | Tripadvisor makes the world small in your hands. It helped me a lot to achieve what I want with the best results. | My go-to app when traveling | Great app for checking reviews from other people and leaving my own. | Easy app to use, very informative | Helpful application to check before you travel | Remains a good app | The best to find a good place.. | It is overall useful but not today. I put in dates for a hotel and I'm finding that their availability is not accurate so I want to search without any dates but the app won't let me. So I'll have to try the web... | Have attempted 5x now to post my review about a dodgy hotel (Mantra Pandanus Darwin) and even after making the adjustments requested by TA it remains unposted. Trip Adviser is now like all the rest, protected sketchy hotels and heavily moderating reviews. Shame. Here's 1 star for wasting my time. | I have always loved Trip Advisor and trust it. | It fun to commened U guys that why i pick five star | awsome | No matter what I do it adds an entire month of extra days to my trip and randomly assigns what I want to do to the dates I'm not there | Βοηθά με την εμπειρία των συνδρομητών για μια άριστη επιλογή του κατάλληλου χώρου | Really useful app. I use this regularly and try and leave a constructive review whenever possible | Used it when we went to Italy. Went to Naples, Rome, Florence, and Venice and was able to book tours, restaurants, and museums all from the app. Easy to navigate, got confirmation quickly Everytime. I also got some really awesome coupons just for writing a few reviews!!! Will definitely use again for trips and highly recommend | Excellent app. Very useful to refer to. Accurate aswell as relative and full of maps histories facts directions and routes | Best place to get info about place and hotels. | ""تجربه غير قابله للنسيان | A must have apps to help you decide on what to do and to have in certain places | Wonderfull | Trip advisors is a wonderful app that I enjoy. It keeps me up to date on the latest, best hotels for my needs. The restaurant's reviewed are always spot on. When I travel I always use this for hotels, Restaurants, and attractions. | I don't think places should be able to take their bad reviews, down! Allison at the Old White Hart pub, in Hook, does that ane lures people in by getting fake reviews from her husband, wow, disgusting. | So satisfying!! Delicious!! | nearly always reliable for the right choices | I like being able to see what other travelers report about their own experiences! | Fab app! | This apps looks very well | Very good | prices in the app are shown vastly below what the websites actually charge. | Fantastic, relaxed, stay with great food and attentive staff . Accommodation spotless | I enjoy using the app as I get an idea of places I plan to visit and I can share my experience as well. | Great for ideas | LUV TripAdvisor! | This is the best app. I always check out what other ppl think about a place before I decide to go anywhere. | Good | sincere information | Good reviews. | We had 4 fabulous weeks at this hotel and was really looked after especially by the waiters chef 👨‍🍳 and the pool attendant | Awesome room..clean.. good breakfast options | Nice | Tripadvisor is really helpful for all the travelers to look for a great tour service around the world. | Like it. It works well and features almost every place that I know | Amazing | I want to see all the presidential museums it's on my bucket list pray for me to get help from my efforts in seeking for help from the presidents U.S. | It's not always current but still great | Awesome app. Very helpful | I love being able to leave reviews and be able to read them too!!! | It's very nice | People are abusing this apps policy. The app is good, the TripAdvisor policy not so much. You may have 20 people at your restaurant. They don't like your restaurants service fee! They love the food, they eat everything. They than can all give you a 1 star review, food, service, atmosphere all 1 ⭐ | Handy app to use while traveling, it helps you discern between the good, the bad, and the ugly | Love this app for all the info and reviews. Very helpful. | Pleasant, user-friendly experience | Always current and up to date with relevant options. | Frightening Shocked this is Allowed on a Regulated Website. First we Noticed our Pictures on different Google Sites The latest has been these Foreign Chinese or Koran Writing on our Photos When we put up the profile It didn`t exist Strange How a Profile with nothing can go on to rate your pictures We had to delete our Reviews to over Ten of our Pictures So we took the decision to close our account immediately The site cannot be safe We closed it | Read them but makeup your own mind. | Great | This is my go to app for recommendations hotels and what to do and all my tours are booked thru trip advisor | The most useful app on the planet PERIOD. | Aviator | Excellent | Нет возможности рассортировать выбранные для поездки объекты по времени работы, цене, рейтингу и т.д. Это бы сильно упростило задачу планирования. Есть похожие функции при просмотре ВСЕХ доступных достопримечательностей, но они скудные и применимы только ко ВСЕМ объектам, а это очень большая куча. Нужен мощный инструмент сортировки уже отобранных объектов. Также на карте нет фото-иконок объектов, всё тупо одинаково синее, что где - с одного взгляда не поймёшь и всё время путаешься. | Fácil de usar y muy amigable | You make it very easy to leave reviews | Always use TripAdvisor when planning holidays for advice on what to see and where to eat. | Good | Good to access and navigate | Whenever I visit a new place, I rely on Trip Advisor to find recommendations of Things to Do, Restaurants and sometimes, Places to Stay. I like the information, descriptions, pricing info, reviews, and ability to make a reservation. | Best travel review app! | I've just come back to the app after a few years break. Useful. | Good app and easy to use | How much can you trust an app that requires extra steps when you post a negative review? Whenever a negative review is posted, they follow up with an email asking to confirm it. A bunch of these have filtered to spam so I have to wonder how many people don't click that extra button? Negative reviews should be as easy to make as the positive. Majority of mine are positive but if I'm saying something negative, it was a really bad experience and the business needs to make corrections | I enjoyed my stay at the hotel And the Staff Was Awesome ✨️ Everyone. I didn't want to leave. Thank You to the Fantastic Bartenders, Dave and Franklin. I hope I have his name right. And my Breakfast Crew They made my Day. And also Thanks 😊 for letting me join the staff party 🥳 It was also my Birthday 🎂. See 👀 you soon 🇺🇸✨️ | Love trip advisor. Very helpful and have used it a lot, especially on our recent trip to various destinations across the world | Great for reviewing before booking. | Great app!!!! | Love using the app | Great app that helps me find the best experiences when I visit different places around the world. 5***** | Have booked 3 tours through trip advisor so far this world trip. 2 have cancelled last minute overnight after accepting payment and confirming. Good for ideas of what to do, don't recommend using to book, Very unreliable. | Great app, for information and reviews. | My happy place. Authentic Ocean front Mexican Villa. Awesome beach with lounge chairs and palapas. Spacious lanias/ patios with spectacular ocean view. Friendly, attentive and kind staff. Highly recommended. | A great resource for travel | Useful | I think TripAdvisor is pretty easy to use. I don't use it too often. But I probably should. | Good experience | Great!!! Helpful information. | Great to check out real opinions | I'm in India it's shows amount in dollars | best app for travelers | Definitely Helpful on holiday finding somewhere decent to eat. | Fantastic | Works perfect one of the best apps to use and easy for beginners to navigate around | If you like to travel, this app is for you. You can find main things to travel in every country | Very informative | Keeps crashing after update, totally unusable. Doesn't remember searches. | Good|🌃 👋 | Best app for find best hotel | A great app to spread the facts | Update: Why add the AI option for trip planning if it doesn't work?? Just an empty five day itinerary to ONP. 2015 review I am a regular user of TA online, but this app couldn't locate the city I currently live in - Boise Idaho. I know there are hundreds of reviews for places in Boise, but according to the app there is no such place! Uninstalled! | Hard to Navigate | It is nice to find information about new places, see pictures and get opinions from various visitors. Most of the times you can get an impression of a place or Hotel or restaurant from the reviews of other visitors. | Very informative | Thanks very nice app | We stayed in hotel The Fern Habitat Candolim Goa from 27th Feb to 5th March 2024. Newly built state of art. Reservation desk excellently handled by Miss Sainali D, Souza. Well neat and clean rooms taken care off by House Keeping. Breakfast and Dinner very yummy. Service by Miss Dipti excellent. No match for her. She is a real asset of the property. Above all General Manager Sh. Sandeep is so courteous. Homely atmosphere provided and celebrate your occasion with great enthusiasm. Lovely stay. | Good 😊 | Love the itinerary planning feature | Wish i knew how the he'll tp use this app | This app is still our go-to for finding everything food and entertainment in our vacation adventure. Great place to share and help others find great opportunities for their adventure. | Good reviews... Always worth checking | One thing you need to do right is to book sh$$t and even that you can't do right wasting my time three times. FIRE YOUR DEVELOPERS they are clearly useless. | Easy to use.

When referred to Booking dot com they did nothing and they allowed previous negative reviews of the property to be deleted my the supplier. Utterly appalled at the lack of transparency, honesty and customer care. Do not use their service or this app. | Good and easy to book | Will never use them again. They left us stranded, agent promised to make it right and then they backed out of any responsibility. Also, the support number leads to a trunk that's only in the local language. Whomever thought that was a good plan has clearly never been left stranded somewhere they don't speak the language! | It's a good site | No Privacy If You Review About Hotel The Hotel Manager Calls You And Ask You To Remove Review Because It's not good for our hotel and keep calling you until you delete the reviews | Always to the level of customer's expectations | My account got hacked and they were able to change the mail address easily and booked a flight with the credits.

Useless customer service as well. Never trying this again. | The best app for price, loyalty and safety | I always find great deals on booking. I like it very much! | Perfectly satisfied, always get what I need | Easy and quick booking 👌🏾 | Huge scam, the holiday was cancelled, initially no interest in giving a refund then endless phone calls just to discover that the support phone number will charge you hundreds of pounds A scam of this size by such a big company is scary This should be illegal | Amazing and easy | Amazing | Great Apps recommendations | Great travel app! | Easy and great | Very good app for all tourist and all | Nice app!!! | Great | Awesome as usual | Great!! | Away overpriced rates compared to other apps like agoda.

Needs immediate attention and there is no way I can find to report a fault with the app Update: they fixed the messages in their app. The app is great. Would benefit from a ""report a bug"" feature | Always use the app when booking as I'm on the move all the time . Very easy quick and convenient | It is useful, but unfortunately, there are no contact numbers | The most incompetent App I have ever seen. I can't even log in without a huge process of password resets. Why not use a timer if enter a wrong password? Industry standarts? Nope. They can't even get the messages to work. I'm shocked. | Best bookings everytime | Easy to use, step by step, even for me | I use this app for the 3rd summer in a row.

I like it a lot less for that. | Excellent | Reliable, useful | Good | Awesome 👌 👏 | Lovely staff friendly and the room is great 😃 | Good | Good 😊 | Good | I really appreciate the updates about our flights. The app notified us of the airline changing the departure gate, so we had plenty of time to get to it and board on time. | VERY EASY TO USE | 🥂Booking made easy😍 | Amazing ..very straightforward,will book again for sure | I get to speak to an actual human.

I tried contacting Customers Service but they are ghosted, no where to contact them. The owner of property overbooks his place every single day, then tells the customers to leave or cancel.

This is a fun, very easy and useful app to use. I'm still testing and am planning our itinerary for an upcoming vacation. Wish list: 1. Add a search function so that I can find things in my overview, itinerary and notes. 2. Add export function to calendar, spreadsheet, Word and PDF. 3. The expense sharing function does not handle changes in currency. | It can't find any cities to Start | This is a wonderful, full featured travel planning app. It is making an extended trip so much easier for my whole family to keep track of. Thank you so much for creating this indispensable tool! I didn't need to pay for the subscription to make great use of this app, but I did (after finding the app so helpful while planning) for my own benefit, yes, but also in thanks to support the developers. I highly recommend this app. | Always a Pop-up window open, can't use it | I'm so glad this app exists. It's better than just writing down a list of places you want to go. However, sometimes when you type stuff in, the screen lags for a second. It's not terrible, but it's still pretty annoying | it was good for planning my trip and make a lists of places | Great concept and tells the user how long it takes to get to their next destination, but the app keeps crashing. I've lost a couple of places I've saved too. Good to start with but best to keep a personal copy with an excel sheet or something | it's very neat! perfect for planning any range of trips | this app is so helpful! everything is in one place. Flights, car rentals, hotels, and your itinerary! | Good concept and has some nice features. However, the UI is SO overcrowded with elements and information I actually got stressed at some point. Maybe squash the bottom side buttons into an expandable/collapsible menu? Hide the summary description for places to visit unless expanded? Shrink the date under the itinerary tab, why must it take 20% of an almost 7"" screen?? Overall nice app, but the UX does need some work to make it a bit more simplified. Too much information in too little space. | My initial review was regarding the frequent pop ups, however a member of the team has reached out and reassured me that things are still a work in progress. I really enjoy using the app, and it has saved me a lot of time compared to planning simply on Google maps. I can confidently say that I'll be replacing Google maps for Wanderlog as my trip planning app. | Not working, can't even specifically any country literally taking a lifetime to load. | ok this app is the best. I can travel smarter, cheaper, and have a better time. this is genius how designed and presented!! | *** I remember why I cancelled and deleted this app. Your FREE trial cost $60.00. In my book that ain't free. I realize that you need to get paid for your hard work, but FREE should be FREE! After the trial period, YOU could disable the account if I don't send you the $60.*** UPDATE- After figuring out I had a bad case intercranial rectumitis (I had my head up my a$$), Wanderlog probably is a very good app, it just wasn't what I need. And their customer service is really top-notch. Thanks | Such an amazing app. I'm usually the trip planner and it is so nice not to have it all in my head, email, written down and then I have to verbally tell others. It's so easy because it is all in 1 place and people can easily be on trips and see info. Like seeing flight info of other travelers is so helpful. It imports it all for everyone to see and you can easily plan out your entire days. The map feature is so nice too. I really can't compliment this app enough. | Little harder to use than the browser. GREAT trip planning app. Already got coworkers hooked on it! | This is a great app for organizing and planning a trip. | This is a really useful and well-done app. But the constant forced tutorials get really overbearing. You can't dismiss them or opt out, and even after using the app for a week I'm still getting them. I really like the app, but this is way too much. | Love the app! | Good but overpriced. I've planned several trips with it an even had a subscription. It's a really good tool, though at times laggy, but the price is just way too high for what you get out of it. | This app was a god send ... It's super easy to use. Planning an upcoming trip and this have mde organizing easy day a breeze and the ability to let others edit the agenda is great as well... The only downside is the Pro upgrade... I would love to access features in the Pro level but currently it's only an annual plan ... I don't need it for a year but would definitely get it for a month or 2. | Great app! | Nice app helps me see my vision in place | The tips are really effing annoying. Allow us to turn them off. | The app is great however, need a monthly subscription choice. I would happily pay for the couple if months I need it for, but not billed annually | well designed comparison of multiple review sites | super easy to navigate | The app worked fine till I signed up for the PRO and now everything is in French although it says English on the sign in. | I have just downloaded this app and so far it has been amazing. I love planning holidays and this just makes it so easy, when I see something online, a place or recommendation I just quickly add it to the app and it's there. I get directions, I get picture and what else is near. I can't give a review of how it works when I'm actually in Italy, but for now I'm finding it really really helpful to sort out where I'm going and the direction that my holiday is going to take. so far it's exciting | Is not actually free | used it for 5 vacations so far over the last 3 years. Love the money splitting capability and distance calculations. I forward all my booking emails and the app does the rest. Best way to collaborate with travel mates on vacation planning. | I used this app for a family trip with two teenagers. We were trying to get our teenagers to engage and help us plan some things to do on our vacation. It worked great! Love the shared functionality, the explore features, the map view, and the ease of adding links from Google. | I really enjoyed planning my trip to Lisbon. I found other tips from other travellers. It was easy to plan, I liked the fact I could see which sightseeing I should do in what order. I wish I could have the option to add t staurants as a separate tab. This might be added as plus option. Otherwise I look forward to planning my next trip | App is good with lots of organizational features, but is incredibly laggy and slow even with good internet connection. | The app is convenient & it includes many functions that are really helpful. Recommend to add in a function that helps us to record the travel fare (like by Grab/Taxi or Public Transport). | very helpful in planning stops and good suggestions | No access to app without paying first. | Good app but cost doesn't seem feasible. I only travel once a year -- two at most. There should be an option to choose payment per trip or per month. | amazing trip planner, we travel alot with family and I don't know what I would do without this app! | love it! makes it so easy to see my plans on the go and make changes to my itinerary as new things pop up | great wee app | Still takes lot of time to load the trip details even in the offline mode (with Pro subscription) Auto-fill day is a good feature but it should take the flight arrival and hotel check-in time into consideration while giving suggestions. There should be an option to choose the start and end time for siteseeing and auto-fill should suggest places based on the available time Budget tracking should have an option to add tripmates locally and not by email. Giving 3 stars as this has huge potential | Great info and options. | Super, super helpful app!! I have been googling sites & using separate apps looking for hotels to plan my family's multiday sight-seeing road trip. But nothing I found prior to Wanderlog had a map that helped track my noted locations, along with daily itenerary categories, places for my notations, and lits more. All of which really helps to organize & simplify the planning of our trip to/in each state & our traveling direction each day. Planning out an itinerary is SO much easier with Wanderlog | This app provides a convenient way to plan the itinerary. It provides a good overview of all the places of interest. | Claims to be a free app, but then insists on a credit card which will be charged after a 1 week trial. If it was worth the $70, I would pay it, but I'm not setting up an automatic charge before trying it. | I've used this app in the past and had nothing but a great experience. Definitely something I would recommend. If you're not the brightest crayon in the box, you might leave a negative review 🫡😉 | Wanderlog allows a comprehensive scheduling experience. I'm able to add places to multiple lists then add each item to different days in the itinerary. I can invite my friends to the plan- & choose who can make changes. Also, when I add a place I can add the cost in any currency I desire, split that payment between whoever I need to, & the total is tallied in my native currency. I also like the ""explore"" option to get ideas for more activities in the area I'm visiting. | This app is great for travel and sharing your trip with those who are traveling with you. I love that the app links to youtube and tiktok, so I can watch videos of the place I am going to visit! | We started using Wanderlog this year, using the free version to plan a trip. We like having multiple users and the map option, which allows us to see how close all destinations are to each other. Today, I accidentally deleted our trip plan. I went to the help section and found that I could email support and they might be able to restore it. As it is Sunday, I didn't expect to hear from anyone, but got an email within hours from one of the app creators, and my trip was back! A++ service and app! | Terrible app. Tried to login on both web browser and mobile app and both FAILED. Website gave me an 503 error while loading the login screen, application doesnt even login. Ditch this app and choose another planner instead. | Just downloaded app to start planning after good reviews. Has uploaded hotel details from email forwarded but doesn't take flight details from same email. Won't let me tap on an airline or flight code when I try to input manually. Frustrated already! | This app makes it easier to plan and share live itinerary with family and friends. I use it to plan nearby activities which showed the distance which help to also plan our transport. And it syncs to Google Map so it is helpful to make last min changes and yet travel safely. Highly recommended travel planning app! | the best planner | great app for planning trips. I will use it for a long time. | This is a great travel planner app! Can't recommend it enough. | The versality of the app was fairly easy to maneuver. Activity suggestions were very helpful in planning the day events. | I'm enjoying all the tips on what to expect and where to visit. this app makes it easier to plan and you can get directions to each place within the app. very convenient . thank you! | I just got this app and I'm already frustrated. I can't add transport between places (like Uber from airport to hotel) I can't add an activity without adding a place but when you add a place it shows all sorts of other information I don't want to see. I don't want recommendations. I don't want pictures. I don't need the web description showing. When I'm done adding places to the itinerary, I want the ""add a place"" field to go away. It could be great but UI is not efficient or customizable | Can't even try without card first no thanks | I found this to be a very useful app for itinerary planning. One feature I would tweak is to have the ability to numerically place a new item into the itinerary rather than having it added to the end and then have to reorder it. Other than that minor issue, it is a great app! | I was able to plan and map out my entire trip. It was a great resource to have! | I am a frequent traveler and travel with big groups 2-3 times a year. This app is EVERYTHING! Makes planning so easy with other people as well. I love it 😀 | lots of tools but still east to use. | Amazing app to plan any trip | Not what I was looking for. This app is too busy | I used the free version for my trip and would say that it reduced alot of unnecessary stress for me to navigate around. The best thing is that it shows the distance and travelling time making it easier to plan our routes without dropping pins on Google map. There's also recommendations of places to visit. Will continue to use this app for more upcoming trips. | wonderful app. it meets all my needs. | great app! | No description on how to use | very helpful app so far. its helped organize my trip, personal and business. good job! | I love how organised this app makes your trip! it keeps all together, from your flight dates and booking nos to where to go next with accommodation reservation nos and addresses. Well worth the money!! | fantastic | absolutely not worth the money. | update sugggestion : great app as always! can you add widget for quick add for expense and quick check in to the current location if possible? **************************** after so long i finally found an app that is how i would want it to be, tho alot of feature r still tba but the core feature are there, thank you for making this! | As a first time user of this app, I can honestly say, that it was super easy-to-use. I've already started spreading the word. It took me a bit to find this app, and so happy that I did. I used to use another app, that is no longer available, a few years back. It's especially helpful with the budgeting feature, when you are splitting costs with others, and knowing who owes $$ to who. I will be using the app for all my trips and will probably upgrade to the Pro version. | Best way to plan a self guided tour! My sister and I took a trip to Ireland, rented a car, and planned the whole adventure with this app. Great suggestions, loads of photos, map features, route optimizing. Excellent! | I'm really enjoying the visual organization offered, I have such a difficult time planning huge trips like this. thanks again because I'm enjoying the process this time. | Enjoyed this app, I was able to invite my travel friend to it and we could plan at the same time. The pre-populated packing lists gave helpful reminders! | Most efficient travel app. Worth the money | By far the best trip planner app I've come across. However, there might be a memory leak issue as the app gets slower and slower with more time spent on the itinerary. The app has been lagging a lot lately. Especially in the map mode. Been using this app for a year, still hasn't been fixed. | This is wonderful apps. It help to plan by yourself or collaborate with others. It also can book through hotel and entrance ticket from the apps. Is one stop solution for travellers... It also record our budget and expenses. It can share to people also. | awesome app. I love it. it connects to emails maps and many more. perfect. | Tried the trial pro version, it couldn't do the first most basic thing what I wanted (import an image of a map...!) - it suggested I save it to a cloud based storage then save the link to that in Wanderlog - seems counter intuitive to me. I have gone back to just using drive and saving all my info in a folder there. Wanderlog not so wonderful after all. | Nice try but WAY too cluttered and complicated, I might as well keep to my current workflow, Google Docs and Google Maps.... no time to spend learning such an information overload. | I loved using this app in planning a recent trip to Italy. I was easily able to import all my reservations and bookings, move itinerary items around, track expenses, and share my plans with co-travelers and family. I really loved the little tips and suggestions, and the option to have the app map my day for travel efficiency. I used to do all this on a spreadsheet and will be using wanderlog going forward | usefull | Great app to keep everything in one place and collaborate with trip-mates | Very helpful in planning our Tokyo trip. | love it!! | It's an excellent tool for travellers, even better from the ones who are not traveling alone. You can share everything with your travel partner (S) and plan together. I really love this app. | Perfect for planning an overseas trip with friends! I love that multiple travelers can collaborate and add to the trip planning. | helpful for our first trip!! the app isneasy to use and navigate | Everything in one app (car rentals, hotels, maps, even AI), you may like it or not. For me it's too difficult to digest (I tried a few times). But when I saw ""your trip is too long"" I finally gave up... | I took a family trip to Portugal, spending 3 days in Porto and 3 in Lisbon (actually here now). The Wanderlog app helped us map out and time our plan so we were able to maximize the sights we saw and work in stops for food and shopping. Highly recommend using this app for all vacations! | The app made traveling around Taipei via public transport a breeze. Won't hesitate to use it again on my next trip. Planning for the trip was also a fun and easy experience. Would not mind paying for per use instead of monthly subscription since I only travel 1-2 times a year. | Works exactly how you expect it to | Wanderlog helped the three of us collaboratively plan our trip and it kept track of our budgeting. It was a great resource to allow groups to track what they are doing each day of the trip. We used it constantly. | feel good to use. will be better if it is easier to edit. | I have planned many trips with Wanderlog. Love it :) | Great app. Easy to use, informative, is a great planner overly. the free version still has a ton of functions to make it perfectly usable. | Very useful app | AMAZING App. This organizes all your travel needs in 1 place, no more looking through multiple apps to find hotel info, flight info, notes. I have the free version and Love it! | I'm using the free version and love it! It's a really easy to use app. Very customisable for each trip with different folders, daily itinerary, and recommendation blogs. You can see all saved places on a map to allow for itinerary planning. Can't recommend enough. | Misleading cost of pro version - I was charged for a full year instead of the monthly cost shown. Not cool. I just wanted to try the pro version for a month before deciding wether or not this would be helpful for my trip. | I like how easy it is to use as it syncs the places I want to go directly into the app! :) hoping to have a timetable tab where I could see everything I've planned though. | This is a great way to sync up your travel party! | This app really makes it easy to plan out a trip, find options for activities or places to visit, select a restaurant, etc. And it's really amazing that the free version will allow you to email your hotel, car rental, and flight reservations to your trip and then automatically fill in the details. It's also nice to be able to share the trip plan with others (either trip mates, or just family and friends so that they know where you'll be). | Must pay | Amazing travel planning app. Super easy to navigate and collaborate with fellow travelers. Win-win for both type A and go with the flow travelers. Thanks! 🙌🏽 | Great for planning trips | Really easy to use, and has plenty ways and spaces to keep your itinerary organized! since there is so much information, the screen can be a bit cluttered at times. Still the best trip planning app I have used. | Do not sign up for free trial!! It's not free. They will charge you anyway! And Google play won't refund or intervene to force them to abide by the ""free"" trial. | Great app, I love the map feature in particular and how easily it can pull information about booking from emails. | Very helpful for getting around places you don't know if you're willing to put in the effort ahead of time. Used it for NYC and just checked what map pins I was close to for what I needed. Had a food list, a picture spot list, and so on. How the itenrary is set up needs a little work but it's still pretty good. | The best travel itenerary builder I've ever used, hands down | Amazing app!! We're using the free version so far, and we're very pleased! The map and the explorer sections are super helpful!! | great trip planning app!!! | There's way too much going on in this app. Tripit is much more user friendly and clean | The app is amazing and has a lot of options go plan your trip. The only that I have noticed so far is it is extremely slow when adding much locations, reservations, etc, even for the Galaxy S22+ which is a high end phone. I am willing to pay the pro version but I need an optimized app, otherwise it is not worth it. | How to search word within our plan/itinerary?? & Oso can pls at least tell yall will add this feature asap? & The driving time needed between places is totally inaccurate mostly. Very disappointed . | Absolutely Fanstastic! My wife and I planned an amazing 8 day trip thanks to this app. Consolidating all information in one place makes trip planning a breeze and saves a lot of hassle and frustration. | Great app for planning and using while on trips. 5 stars | Very easy to use and intuitive. I tested out 3 different apps before settling on this one. It goes beyond expectations and even gives helpful tips. (Turns out our trip falls on a local holiday!) | Really easy to use, a great way to collate the trip details | easy to streamline trips. I wish there was more color option or if we can choose colors because it tends to mesh in if youre in one area for multiple days as the colors look very similar | wanderlog is the best | Excellent free travel app, great for planning trips and sharing with fellow travellers. | So far it's super easy to navigate & put my entire itinerary in one spot. My biggest concern is if it's going to do what I want while I'm on the road to my destination. I want to make stops along the way, but am unsure how to even find places with this app that are along the way. | We don't want a free trial because ITS A SCAM. WE..... yes WE, should decide if we want to PAY after we try your app out. HAVING TO CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION ON OUR OWN IS SCAMMY. Your approach is dishonest and underhanded. Tripit got my $$$ because your process is greedy. Congrats. | Really appreciate the UI and the fact that I can still use the app functionality despite only utilizing the free version. Will definitely upgrade to Pro version when I am able. | I just want to find way home | Kalo mau traveling tertata dengan baik, wajib pake aplikasi ini. | I like the map that is beside the program and that it has numbers. You can create lists. I like that you can add the expenses at each place. It has suggestions. I like that you can keep notes. I like that everybody can see it and edit. I like that you can add your photos at each place. I like that you can add the distance from each place to the other. Overall, I like that it has all these in one place and it is a nice way to keep record of your trips. Every little detail is much appreciated! | Absolutely love this app! As a Type A planner myself, this is the best app to use when planning a vacation! | The best tool for trip planning. Not perfect but the managers are listening and improving constantly | almost perfect! but good enough to warrant 5 stars from me | Amazing, this is very helpful! | absolutely wonderful. love this app. genius idea. | Very useful for long road trips. Lots of great features in the free version. Would love to pay for the full version, but a pity that it has to be a full year commitment straight away. | so easy to use! | Edit: Places I've added have stopped disappearing for now. I'd still recommend not relying on this app alone to plan your itinerary. Definitely have a spreadsheet and/or Google maps as a backup. Original: A lot of the places I add keep disappearing. It's also not allowing me to access feedback/support. Other maps apps are more reliable. | Really useful. Would like some features like: Ferry tickets. Tour reservations, Icons for an emergency list: (Police, hospital, consulate) | Love it thus far! | Despite saying it is free the app tries straight away to charge. Immediately deleted it. | I really like this app as everything is in one place and easy to finf | Too expensive for what it does | When I was signing up I was offered the annual subscription for 49.99.... 15 mins later I'm liking what I see, and get hit with the ""20% off limited time special"" except the cost for the year is now 63.99...what?? Make it make sense. | super helpful | My favorite trip planning app! Aesthetic, intuitive and user friendly. Gets me pumped for my trips and keeps me organized! | A wonderful app that makes the trip planning a lot more easier. It's a pure joy who loves planning trip. | Fabulous well thought out app, planned and kept us on track when travelling to New York. Will definitely continue to use. | Amazing travel planner! I wish this app existed years ago 👏 | I am loving this app! I am using it to plan my Tour of Italy trip, which prior to the app I had spent countless hours organizing! this app has been amazing! It even notified me that one of my lodgings had closed permanently! huge Saver! the app saved me a 3hr. drive and lots of aggravation! | Absolutely loved this travel app to prepare for my 7-day trip to Paris. I found it so helpful to plan each day intubation Itinerary and fit in all of things I wanted to do while optimizing our time. We were able to do most everything we planned and then some! Loved the AI feature and checklists, too! | it helped us pull together our travel plans, and gave us lots of travel flexibility. I don't know how we could have pulled together four different people's preferences into a cohesive plan | Able to back-dated trips is an excellent feature, now that I can keep records of my travels. TQ | It's a no brainer!! One place for everything. !From your flight plans, accommodation, places to see or eat. Create your own list and personalise your trip. I love the interactive map that gives you website details at your fingertips. Can't wait to see how well it works once I am on my getaway | Very helpful in planning out trips. | Good | Easy and fun to use. Map you itinerary beforehand and spend more time enjoying the sights. | This would be perfect if I had a way to do group texting with the people I'm sharing the itinerary with. | Going to make it so much easier when walking the Camino Frances | Extremely happy with this app. Super easy to use to plan activities but also get extra information on the fly about what we are visiting with the links to Google and TripAdvisor. Also gives an estimation of the transport time between 2 activities and you can vary the mode of transportation between during the day. Cannot recommend it enough for trip planners! | I told my daughter and my friends. | very helpful during the planning of my trip | Found the app really useful, helpful and would definitely use again. I would also recommend to others needing help to plan and structure their trips, especially for areas they are not overly familiar with, with regards to locations. | App is very laggy and has sync issues. | This is a great app, and I like being able to forward my reservation email to a unique address to import the details of the trip. Lots of helpful planning tools, etc. even with the free version. Using the free version allows you to get an understanding of the app without making a commitment. | I tried a few commonly suggested itinerary apps before landing on Wanderlog. They have just about every feature you could want; I often found myself hoping a feature existed before checking & it would turn out to be already implemented! Understandably, a few are locked behind a subscription. I'm considering upgrading to Pro to support the team, but it's hard to justify because I only take such trips once a year. If there were monthly subscriptions, I'd seriously consider it! You guys rock!! | Very helpful in organizing everything I needed for a trip in one location! | intuitive layout for quick on the fly trip planning. map and routes make it time saving | I love this app. use it to plan all my trips. | Love this app | Would totally recommend to anyone it is easy to use | Very good apps for travel planner. | Fantastic app, helped us put our plans in order, create packing lists with ai and push the directions to Google Maps on our phone while on the go. Recommend it to anyone who is the planner for family holidays - much better than the old excel sheet and printed out addresses! | Got me through my first family trip as the planner and I can tell my family enjoyed every stop I took them to. I didn't have anyone to coplan with, but I've seen the itineraries my friend has made with her coplanners and it sounds very easy according to her. The only annoying UX thing was how the rearrange menu would go to the beginning of the itinerary, even when I try to rearrange day plans for days after that. I hope this feature will be added in the future. | I have been using this to help me plan a trip to NZ, Fiji and SE Asia. I love that you can search for a location and there are recommended things to do there. This is much easier than generally searching the internet as you can then quickly add it to a list for the future! You can also add your bookings to this by simply forwarding an email, so simple! | awesome way to organize a roadtrip | maps r good for now. Interface is best | so far so good | It is constantly trying to get you to upgrade. To the point you can't use it. | Welp. I thought this would be cool But only 1 of the 5 Airbnb's I stayed at, were added to my trip. It says to email confirmation. It worked for one stop and that's it. If you can't add where I'm staying then everything else is pointless. You guys get that figured out, 3 stars. Also in Northern Cali, this app ""doesn't have full coverage of the surrounding area"". Have state parks and destinations you want to add to your trip? Too bad, not this app.After getting that notification..I uninstalled | I don't use the pro version. I've managed to plan and set an itinerary for my 3 week trip through Japan. very useful and easy to use. | The app is really nice, helps you get done a lot in terms of organising, is very well thought and the flows are intuitive. Also, performance wise is very nice. I really recommend it, it's one of the best if not the best. | used this for a trip to l.a, really helpful for keeping everything straight when it came to planning!!! | I rarely leave reviews, but so far, I'm very impressed. This is a really good app that consolidates all my travel reservations in one place. Airline, rental car, hotel, agenda, itinerary, activities, etc. It is so easy to import all of these loose ends by simply forwarding the confirmation emails to my profile. I did have to QC the details and make a correction, but it was all entered into my trip data, so even that was pretty simple. Great job with this. I plan to use it for all my trips. | Doesn't plot short trips or search by business names. Using it requires the person to search with awkwardly formal addresses that may or may not register. Probably good for city to city but not for around town trips. | Used Wanderlog for the first time while planning a trip with a friend to Mexico. It was great to have a place to share information during the planning stage, and we often referred to our Wanderlog during the trip. Used the app on both mobile and on a laptop. It was easy to seamlessly add all of our reservations in one place and build a collection of things to see and do and places to eat. Would definitely use Wanderlog again! | love the simplicity and the intricacy of the app | Absolutely love it. It's the best for planning. | No thanks. Glitchy amd popup heavy. Needy. | So far so good. What I love even on the free version is the ability to see all the POIs on one map. Then I can see where the logical place to stay... | I believe I enjoyed more of my last trip by using it, by optimizing time and not losing visits because of opening hours. Listing everything you want to do before or while going on a trip is really helpful. I was looking for just a ""map with a checklist"" then I found a better trip planner for myself :) | easy to use! loved it for my trip to Spain | Might have some uses, but just directed me to Google maps and kayak. I could do this myself. | keeps all your documents in the one place. love it | I found this app a couple month's ago and love it. I've been a planner for as long as I can remember. I have 5 trips I'm activity planning with this app. It's nice to have hotels, resturants, activities, and budgeting all in one app. It's very user friendly.

I went back to amend my review because customer service is almost non existent. I had an issue due to kayaks error and have not received any help. Yes I understand they link you to a site, which was the error incorrect hotel city. No help from the non existent customer service, i am using hopper more and more thanks to kayak | it's a very good application. | great app saves you lots of money | Good deals | good but I thought could do better with finding cheaper flights | Favourite travel app... Super grateful. Can't say how many times I run to kayak. | عالي | So far very helpful | One stop shop. | Incredably helpful!!! ...always has been. | Keeps starting as based in UK. What so good about the Brits?? Then when i input sgp, it returns as flying off from jb.... Worst thing is keep showing as flying off from boston.. total rubbish, ur app team ought to be sacked | was easy to use. | a great site to investigate prices and make comparisons. | Higher price reflects as compared to other platforms | General good usability, but I accidentally booked a flight a month too late | So reliable and correct information especially pricing! uptodate prices available easily. | excellent | This app just because the worst app when ever u hit search to look for flight the app closes | good service | app is broken after update, fares not available message pops up, unusable if you want to see the current deal you're viewing | good | Easy to use, useful, great feature to find and customize travel plans. A dear favorite so far. | very nice. | Awesome travel prices! | best travel app out there easy to use | The rates are always better somewhere else. The car rental insurance is not helpful, as the rental company said they won't accept it. | log in is now very difficult | Price alerts don't fit screen on galaxy s3 | Love the trip tracking! | great app highly recommend it. enjoy | This is my go-to app but it just stopped working on my Pixel 6a. Whenever I click Search it closes the app. Please fix this bug. | the best of the best apk | today I tried to search for hotels in Bermuda and the app told me it couldn't find a location with that name 😂💩 I then searched for Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Seattle with the same result 👎 | Newest version crashes when I hit search. | good | Very helpful to finding affordable plane tickets | very good | In Website, service good. | When I go to book it takes me to a blank grey page! | Trying out prices is great love it | Expensive site | it's great Appe to find a cheapest ticket | very good site for international travel | Everything is going to go well with you're arrangements made by the application!!!!!! | great app | Very Good App | Show the type of aircraft which will be used for the flights shown in search results. | I like it little better than Experian. I was able to find a good cheap flight pretty easily and the price notification is also a handy feature. The ""scientific algorithm to buy tickets at a cheaper price"" isn't always correct so just feel out for it and analyze yourself as it does give you a chart and a chart of probability. All in all I like more than Experian so this app is quite nice for finding good priced flights! | Kayak, my go to powerhouse flight search engine. Incredibly comprehensive and useful. Highly recommend | Don't trust this app. | Found great price for trip to Italy | I find better deals on the actual web sites | Great app with cheap prices!!! | nice 😍 | excellent 👌 | i love it | Best deals! | Prices are not as advertised!! I get results with cheap flights, but as soon as you click on the link to get redirected, prices jump at least a few hundred percent. Went from 149 with United to 780 once on the site. What is the point in using this app? Also won't save my CAD preference, keeps reverting to USD which is an unpleasant surprise | We aren't able to filter out specific airplane models when searching for a flight? I'd rather not risk my life flying on a Boeing. | Worst travel app ever for booking hotels , every time you click a hotel the price changes by an insane amount or half the time it says the rooms no longer available... like how stupid is this app. I won't be using any company associated with booking holdings Inc because of their bad practices . | love this site! we travel a lot and always use this site! | the app gets stuck on tap the heart for just browsing. I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry. I generally check multiple sites including the individual airlines and I never find a cheaper fare than Kayak. | The Best | I would say it's the best well put app made. | V good | Constantly showing false prices. Click on flight and nothing shows. Uninstalled. | love the many options and especially how kayak manages my trips! | convenient and reasonable | good 👍 👍👍👍 | good | They should call it Kayad, as all it is is ads now. And it's not one and done. They don't cover Southwest. Price notifications are useless | Reliable site | More convenient | hard to book a flight | Easy to use. | Me encarta esta aplicación para mi es la mejor que hay | The app is okay. But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selección). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change. I will absolutely never book through kayak again. | My go to travel app | Just updated to newer version... now useless. Can't do searches at all.. | If the app worked maybe I could give a more positive review | good service to have | great comparison site | Minghella Me..myomyomon | I cannot even get this to download. | Uninstalled .. After so many years of loyalty. I had to uninstall with heavy heart. Kayak used to be user oriented search engine and now its another corporate machine which works only for the best deals which suit their sponsors ! Bye Kayak | Won't accept payments. I tried several different cards. | Pire application. Affiche des prix qui ne sont même pas bons. On clique dessus on fait toute la manipulation pour réserver et au dernier moment ça t'annonce que le prix a augmenté. Tu retournes sur l'application c'est toujours l'ancien prix. Mettez vous d'accord | Some filters simply don't work correctly which is very annoying. Similar apps momondo do work as they should | I've used this app for years and recommend it to everyone that tells me they are looking to travel! | was such a great app but it appears ryanair is no long on it so lost all interest in the flight section | Good app | Doesn't recognise my city as somewhere to search for flights from | whenever I click on search flights...it says pls change the date or location nd search again....every single time | Nice | Amazing | Kayak is my first stop for finding a flight. I usually cross-check directly with the airlines - especially with overseas travel. | saves money! great app | Comprehensive and easy to use. | boca raton | made for usa customers. Not Good for the World community | Still my favorite travel site, but it seems not to have the number of specials from years past. Good people's when contacted, which is exactly what I've always liked about they're site! | great App | I tried this app once to book car rental and for some reasons the pick-up and drop-off time were pre-set to 12nn and can't be changed, we decided to book anyway. It turned out that the car rental shop closed at 12nn and we were not able to get our car but still got charged for the rental plus insurance. We also learned that Kayak outsources rental to yet another 3rd party/middleman company and getting a refund is next to impossible. Just book directly, don't use this app. | kayak is the best.. more places to choose from.. | okay for flight simulations | Rental car is scam | this app used to be better before the pandemic but now it's not the same. | Great app. it offers the best and cheapest flights | really good | Lowest price hotel was triple other sites, also would only allow up to 4 guests in a room where others have allowed 6 as we required. | Cool concept, but when it told me $1800 for a ticket I can buy directly from United for $900 for the exact same flight, I lost all confidence that I'm getting the best price when using the app. | The app deceives people, you can buy tickets cheaper on other websites. I was looking at tickets from London to Istanbul. They sell a ticket for £192, but Pegasus sells it for £113 for the same days and times. Same airport and airlines 😁 | I Love It.Donna Spinner | Since I have installed your app, I have used only one time. And the reason is, because when I try to find more affordable tickets your green date are often more expansive then orange and red one's. I wander why.. | Now that Expedia and Booking have bought every competitor all of these great old sites / apps like Kayak are worthless. Too bad the FTC never blocked any of these takeovers. | good | Best travel app. | Is perfect | There is no boeing filter, false advertising. That was the only reason I considered the app. | it keeps crashing | best app in the w. | Fast and easy to use. | not recommended. | works great | Very uselful | Very good indeed | Garbage no prices are correct | great | works well | Great little handy app having all your travel info in one place. Would be nice to attach a photo to your trip as the cover photo to help identify it from the others. | using kayak for years. | I really only use kayak for tracking my flights. I've never booked any flights or hotels so I can't say how good that aspect of the app is. However I've had no issues with the flight tracker, and more often than not, kayak updates any delays before the actual airport. Puts my mind at ease when I'm travelling | I rented a car and if course my car vauture was refused and its not possible to have customer service with kayak. Gotrental com was the 2nd company and the actually renter is called Alizes . avoid all those company if you can | best for finding rooms and flights | Not easy to navigate | I used this website as per my friend recommendation to get the lowest international rate.I chose justfly to book 2 tickets.I noticed a discrepancy on my phone number, so right away, I tried to correct the number. I was told that it could take 2 weeks to process the changes. I haven't received anything til now. I tried sending messages again at #justfly chat,and this time,I was told to wait 2 hours for a reply via chat?!(WOW). This company employs some of the rudest customer service ever. | Good Search Engine for booking flights | Easy to make arrangements and planning. | Works as advertised, thanks! | It seems like not all airlines are included, e.g., Southwest, but most of them are included. | the best | Best price for your assistance and high quality!!!!Thank you so much,KAYAK service!!!! | Nice app | very good pricing with good options | Convenient and up to date withany options great price search for flights, easy to use very intuitive, many features , definitely worth installing the app. | Great with the exception that every single time I wanted to use the app it would ask me if I wanted to sign in. NO, I don't want to sign in! Stop asking!!

The problem is the search error issue still hasn't been fixed after all these years. Sometimes when I search flights it will only pull about 10 to 20% of the results. Instead of kayak saying \""search error\"" it just displays the results with the majority of the flights missing. There's no easy way to get it to search again either, once it thinks it has all the results it just keeps showing the same."",""I find Kayak to have the most customizable flight alerts. It's still the only service I know of to offer flexible dates on searches. However, functionality is not great. For ex when i get push notifications for a low price, it doesn't bring me to the alert. I have to manually navigate to the saved search and sometimes i can't even find the low price i was alerted to. Plus there doesn't seem to be a way to opt out of email alerts."",""In the past the app has been pretty accurate with prices. But there's a huge bug in the saved trips right now, where most of the prices in those lists are not refreshing. I have to click on the flight (if it even lets me, doesn't always) to go see what the actual price is, but even then I see the old price when I return to the saved trip. This started after this last update."",""Does as well as any other app and better than any I've tried, including the over-advertised Trivago. Love the ability to track any flight (even see where it is enroute) and the ability to view all departures and arrivals for ALL flights at any airport. I also like the fly to anywhere feature that will show current best rates all over the country, displayed on a map. It also keeps track of all past trips and total miles travelled. I can't think of any negatives.""]",false,false,false,"com.kayak.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kayak.android&hl=en&gl=us"

A situation arose with escalating warnings from the United States State Department against traceling to my destination, resulting in me canceling my trip at least 5 weeks before my departure. Despite buying trip insurance with Expedia and AIG during booking, the hotel refused to refund my money, as did AIG. Once paid, say goodbye to your money!

This update contains some bug fixes and performance improvements to make your digital experience as smooth as possible. Bon voyage, traveler!","[""I have used Expedia for years. I eventually got the App and appreciated its ease and particularly the notifications on trips, fares, and reservations. My absolute best part. For the last month or so it's been 'buggy'. Pretty much since it went to a 2 step verification I cannot log in to the app. Deleted and reloaded. Hopefully, that will do it. Otherwise, that will be a wrap for me. Update: the delete and reinstall worked for me. Don't know what the issue was."",""The app since they changed to OneKey points will not let me sign in. I've tried so many times and it always tells me it's something on their end and to try again. Well I do try again, and same thing with the same result. Edit 03/24: the above was fixed on their app but the app is still not functioning 100%. I just booked a car rental that I cannot change or cancel. The app at some point switched my drop off time while I was searching and booking the rental. Frustrating!!! Please fix your app :("",""I only use Expedia for hotels. it's easy, quick and they have a great selection. once we had trouble with a hotel that had suddenly closed, all amenities including the pool. The hotel is in Costa Rica and Expedia took care of it and moved us to another hotel. I can't recommend them enough. I also have gotten many free hotel rooms by using my rewards which are easy to build up."",""I will never use Expedia again. I booked a hotel 2 months before my trip and on the app it said nothing about a minimum age requirement. I drove 9 hours to get to my hotel and they would not give me the room because of my age. Then I had to drive another 1 hour to another hotel that, thankfully, had one more room left. I tried calling Expedia to get reimbursed for the second room that I had to pay for, for the inconvenience and they said no. They did not even try to help me in anyway."",""Trying to merely email, redirects back to settings, made me download app because the website couldn't change. the app had the same problem, chat function kept requiring confirmation number and authentication and never worked either. Repeatedly gave feedback without luck, no way of sending support request. Wasting time losing sleep and giving up at this point. Not impressed with the app. I will watch for further developer comments after they look into the problem and adjust rating.""]",false,false,false,"com.expedia.bookings","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.expedia.bookings&hl=en&gl=us"

The flight and hotel reservations are easy to make and has great prices. | Easy to use and money saver | Easy to use! | This booking service causes so many problems. Dishonest and shady ad tactics. Promises of things never received. I have exclusively used hopper for a year. Hoping to see things that never come. I will be looking for another provider for this service. I'm tired of the problems I deal with almost every weekend. | Great prices alert you as soon as the price change something you should consider using often | This App rules, saved me some time and money | Haven't booked yet so I'll report back! | Do not trust this site fake promotions and they will take your money without giving you a confirmation number. | I've found some amazing deals on Hopper. I used to plan my trips and then try to find cheap fairs. Now I find cheap fairs and plan my trips around that lol thanks Hopper. | Everytime I try to book a room it's says something went wrong. So I refresh the app and do it again and now the room went up $10 and still says something went wrong, did it a third time and the same room went up another $7 and still says something went wrong. I'll just stick to Priceline and the other apps. | The discount | very affordable and quick way to get flights and rooms | Easy to use | I love it | Hopper was supposed to watch a flight and notify me of price changes. When I go to book the flight i'm notified last minute that the flight was now $420 more and if I'd like to continue. I choose not to and go directly to American Airlines to check on the same flight which the price had not gone up. Today I go on hopper and look at flights and the same flight price was shown as the one I was going to book. I go through to book it and AGAIN the price ""just changed"" Customer service was clueless. | Good offers | Love it | Totally satisfied every time I use it | I have been waiting for my refunds for couple weeks now and still haven't received it. This app is a joke | Best app ever since I have it I'm very happy with the service | Love Hopper because they have great deals. | Excellent | First timer | Awesome can beat the prices and the easy steps. Good job | always great experience with hopper | I love it | Easy to use and find a good deal on flights! | It's pretty straight forward and efficient! I've found great flight deals here especially | Awesome rates | this company is questionable, I was advised I would get a refund so I paid cancellation fees then I never got a refund. I fought them for months, will not use again, going directly through the airline is safer. | The best app to get the best price | Always the best deals... Have never had an issue using this app. | Great app. Reasonable prices. | A very useful, helpful, and great App. | I personally love it, great deals | I love hopper always get great deals and love the flexibility hopper is a great app. | Savings savings savings | Works as advertised | I been finding the best deals but lately they have been higher than other sites like Priceline. | Easy to use, good prices. | I got the least inexpensive flights from all the other sites , and wasn't charged any thing extra. My first choice in booking my flights | Hopper has been amazing, every time I need to go somewhere this is my first stop and it's always the least expensive! Great app | The hopper app is great for saving money on fairs. It has not steered me wrong once and I have always saved money whether booking through Hopper or directly with the carrier after finding the best rate on Hopper | great | Very helpful app | Awesome 😎 | Love | Nice hotel services | Easy to use. Highly recommend. | Great | Great app for comparing flights, I find Hopper is cheaper than the other ones. | Thank you | Fantastic | App Is very simple and useful, recomend 100% | All good! | Awsome app. | Wonderful | Fast, accurate, reliable. | great | This app has never let me down. But you don't get to keep Hilton points | I'm just trying Hopper, hopefully I can leave some good reviews in the near future! | Great app. | I've been using this app for years, it's easy to use, and saved me a lot of money! Even used it to go to Italy! | All your deposits are non refundable and they don't communicate with the hotel, they don't have the proper information for bookings and whenever a problem comes up they always push it onto the hotel. I downloaded this app for a trip and showed up and they had put me and my friend in for a single bed instead of the 2 I reserved so now I have $200 gone that could've been used for anything else. AVOID THIS APP. ITS A RIPOFF! | A very good app | gave me three different prices for the same hotel/ room size.. when I added my discount the price went UP. when I contact customer support the rep told me I was wrong and that it cannot be possible when I was looking at the screen, when I offered screenshots I couldn't get an email. | I rated it one star because the bad service cost me $200+ because of the advice of one of the customer service reps based abroad, to cancel and rebook my hotel with promise of a refund within 3-5 business days. It's been 2 months now and when I try to call the automated system says I don't qualify for VIP service, my case has been flagged in their system so I get the run around and not speak to anyone. Even the email reply is automated. Curse you Hopper! I want my money back! | A bit confusing booking flights | It's very effective in tracking flight fee to get the best deal. | Finally a hotel website that lets you see the REAL price for a room A++ | Hopper comes thru for me every time! | Loved | It's always given me great hotels and wonderful suggestions! | The app doesn't allow me to input my passport info for airline bookings; therefore, I went on another app to make my bookings, and I git a better price there. | I love it it's bringing down the price of my trip to Florida it's giving me alerts just by | Fast way to hotel rooms | Nice | Frustrating but I figured it out. | I will NEVER USE THIS AGAIN. I bought tickets for me and my sister. And I wanted to get another ticket FOR THE SAME FLIGHT for my other sister, who is a minor. It won't let me. Saying she is an unaccompanied minor. She ISN'T. it's THE SAME FLIGHT THAT I'M ON. I just wasn't sure she was going with us until later. I tried calling. It won't connect me to a person. It repeats the same message over and over to find a hopper ID to get help. IT'S NOT THERE. IT WANTS ME TO PAY $5 TO GET HELP. M-37ZC71 | Awesome | Pathetic | Love this app | Customer service is awesome 👌🏽 | Love love. My go to for plane tickets!!! | Best flight price | Very cheap and a easy app to use thanks alot hopper | I have used the app to compair and see what is availablr | Would rate 0 this app is known for being super shady. I had booked a room through them over a week in advance. They took the money off of my card but surprise they never actually sent it to the hotel. When I called about this and asked for a refund I was denied it saying it was past my check in time but since the money was never sent I couldn't check in anyways. I suggest sending any disputes with them to your bank I have already done so and am awaiting results. Will not be interacting with them | Very bad service.....not option to call Customer care... | Impressed. As a travel agent for over a decade, now a UX design/CX experience consultant, I'm extremely critical of digital platforms. However, Hopper offers excellent pricing/price protection, ux navigation, & customer support functionality. It is evident that the team behind the app seek, take, & implement user feedback to consistently improve the platform. Recommend the app to my entire personal, professional, and digital network consistently. Will continue to be a highly satisfied user! | Garbage. Unnecessary fees everywhere; they try to make it so you can't cancel without paying extra, even when the hotel itself has lenient cancelation policies. This ""service"" saved neither money nor time. It just made it a messy nightmare. | Awesome rates and updates | Amazing cheap | Easy to use and I've found flights on this app that aren't on the airline website | Love this app gives you all the options | I put a freeze on a hotel and a week later checked a few other companies. I found it cheaper on a different website and when I called hopper to see if they would price match. All the guy wanted to know is if I wanted to get a refund. When I explained I would like to get a price match I got I'm sorry we can't refund the fees and I have to cancel the freeze. Besides I could barely understand the customer service guy. Will never deal with them again. Worse customer service ever. | I have always founded the best deals. This app is just awesome! | I missed my connection flight and since I brought the insurance my next flight was much cheaper. | Great way to find cheap tix | Keeps me informed | there is no done button to take you back to the previous screen after selecting an airport. | Awesome. Great deals | very handy | However it shows me the best price, it doesn't let me buy the ticket. This app is simply waste of time... | My family and I traveled to Atlanta via Jet Blue then Savannah by way of a rental car..Hopper provided us with a great discount.The trip was great. | It is helpful a lot to find the best flights ✈️ 👌 | great | Best app for travel | Found a great ticket last minute... way cheaper than booking directly through the airlines! | Good app | I have a tour agency in Costa Rica and we suggest Hopper to all of our potential clients. | So far I love it. I like that it updates you on flights/trips you're interested in! | The fact that this app can predict when to expect fluctuations in prices is awesome. Not giving 5 stars yet because I have yet to purchase tickets. | Easy and functional | It's been a great way to get the best price for a quick flight or even longer international ones! Highly recommended | This app is a great way to find savings without all of the hassles of other sites. Simple to use and it allows you to set a watch for price adjustments on flights. | Hopper does not honor their return policy. I have to fight tooth and nail for a refund. | I love this app also recommend to everyone | I Love this App. | Very good | Very helpful. | I'd still rather speak to a person, customer service. Only because of my vision issues. | I love Hopper! | genial 👍🏾 | Very convenient keeps an eye on flights for you! | Good app | Awesome app | Best deals | Wao | Amazing 😍 | I hadn't traveled since 2007. This app, recommended by my cousin, helped me and my father through our trip from Czech Republic to Barcelona and back to Puerto Rico. | Love Hopper great rates on so many things. Often beat the competition. | Its been great !!!! Perfect way to reserve a place no hassles | The best hotel discount app ever! | Dope | If I could leave 0 stars I would. i booked a car rental the other day SPECIFICALLY asking for a car rental place AT the airport.

TURO said they would fix and didnt, HOPPER is REFUSING to fix it and the last few agents I spoke with couldn't even understand basic questions.","{""1"":23189,""2"":3423,""3"":4367,""4"":12992,""5"":87616}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"9","9","VARY","Hopper Inc.","Hopper+Inc.","help@hopper.com","https://www.hopper.com",,"https://hopper.com/legal/privacy-notice","Hopper+Inc.","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wlYIPXC8F0EFUPAqP0FdjveY0BoEoa4y3hVAM5pwRtmzp1AXiWZpMCvklouZgvurLtw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LqhKi_WgZ-j8lBS9aZeCGsfXN1_JjFB9HaCz40cJ99FvRGNSYLhF089NBQP0yrJxrbI","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RuKlzt6yt6O41sxih1jRGR4rS_4C8hvqIhKlGqhg5V9VSzxVf-xMXMpki3qRFqqRZg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SwYwjWBDBZcIwx6MTMVNXYch7LzzuQxPobRBEXsnBtY9WB8K3gdy4nGy-kmcn1WxAces"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qLBbn2ujvPOLZhlT1saBod4vc3ooxm6jE2f4aHh6V1onsmLgaHZzZ44r_Fwt5MXdiCs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/H6tDU7x4zbwI6rulpdBT2gfVgGDSKP2r4iA0qrYMcJkjifw5_tDD6mIzXhzqFlVoKQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KQa6is5Z8bLsPu0txseOv1IVqgxgkAT8ZEyxI-y08-jYUEkfkd3UZ_ARwgsUjyYk2Vw9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X-GIe6oJ1j-Ax3a--23zuvY5q_XiC2gDvIkmGYp1vF9tVmcs7XTgGyO13QY7wRTqd9k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b3RMD6jhmhnu8oUd3S0_zi-iveg_WKiue2Wjr5qIGPmSXg9H47NdJrVgg51I_YxASfo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Le15I1oFZWqvnCY3Siu5A1UxIOKyDjcG2rQ2HVdwJwr6cF7uOLnh_9AjPnX93-RfgjgN""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Aug 30, 2015",1711389602000,"5.56.0","Bug fixes and UI improvements<br>","[""All your deposits are non refundable and they don't communicate with the hotel, they don't have the proper information for bookings and whenever a problem comes up they always push it onto the hotel.

Lot of frauds, and Airbnb does nothing despite evidence. | Used to be useful, but prices have gone up a lot and they are not transparent. Entirely useless for booking for a touring holiday, I've just had a booking cancelled and now need to find new accommodation and re plan routed for two days. | They're really picky when it comes to getting verified. Airbnb - you're not a bank, you're just a hotel service. Relax. | Always the best homes in the city where we book! Never a bad experience! | Easy navigation and great explanations of property. | Good | Tortuous | Awzm...... | The service charges and cleaning fees are ridiculous. I got charged a $30 cleaning fee for a 1 night stay of 1 adult. I'm in town for a wedding and will only be using the room to sleep. Tack on $15 ""service fee"" and 15 dollars of taxes and my fees are the same costs as my room. | As a host, it was stressful just renting out a room, thought that's how Airbnb started now everyone expects a hotel, some guests are amazing some are just stupid and inconsiderate, Airbnb as a whole customer service was amazing, no bugs for me, only thing annoyed me was how a guest can 1 Star you get you suspended so you can't get more people in, when if they just read the description they could of avoided it or find something different, overall it was alright just some people are stressful | I don't appreciate when rents are confirmed and all plans have been organized, that bookings can be canceled without any penalty to the rental unit owner. This has happened more than once, so Airbnb is not a reliable reservation platform. | It's a good app, BUT the cleaning fee is unjustified. It could be from $200 to even $500 for a cleaning fee. The owners of the house complain over the floor, not being dusted because there were crumbs in the kitchen. These owners need to understand that the cleaning fee is not a bonus for them. It's to hire a cleaning crew. Airbnb needs to start getting verified payment for cleaning crews . Because the home owners are messing up ratings for costumers | When hosting the list/unlist option, it is not available anymore in the app it might be because of the update of the app | The app is fine, the pricing is disappointing...I can find great places at good prices, but now every place has ""cleaning fees"" that double the price many times when you check out. Really disappointing and I just end up getting hotels. Other than that, I would definitely have gotten many places for a night. | Awful app experience. Constant log-in crashes and issues. | It is waste of time and money | Good so far | Very affordable places and Very nice | The support of AirBnB is not at all a guest centric, they finally put the ball in hosts court for him to make decision even though if host has been non responsive at all. How can a murder be a jury to decide fate of the situation! | I was a host with airbnb and my payouts are blocked since 10th November 2023. Every time I contact their support team, they make me go round in circles and I end up where I started. They still haven't paid me what's owed to me. This is the worst app for running your hotel business. Their customer support is the worst. Call their helpline and you can feel how hostile they are when you blame them for their mistakes | Good...just add address so that when we search we can see how fat the place is from where we are | Airbnb is very easy platform to use | Very helpful and responsive! | Good | Easy to use | Love the communication and how safe | Love it | Good,but it's very important to add app language choice view in settings | Easy to book. Good selection | the only thing I don't like is that the price keeps going up everytime you go back to it. | We've enjoyed every trip! | easy | it won't let me confirm my number, my boyfriend is in hospice with stage 4 cancer.i. hundreds of kms away from. home and support to be here with him. I reached out for helps with support for them to tell me to get a new cell phone, new number and new email. no. I cannot do that. support is a joke and isn't helpful.dont use this app unless you want to be told to spend more money to be able to use this. let's cause more stress and pain instead of helping | Airbnb is slowly but surely worsening over time. I used to LOVE airbnb, but now not only is it overpriced, they are basically allowing host crooks and scammers onto the site with greater frequency. Me and my wife are trying to plan a trip and on two occasions within half an hour, we had someone ask us to cancel a reservation and rent from them off site and another try to get us to pay more after a reservation with a $0 refund policy. Edit Airbnb gave a refund, but only after pushing hard for it. | Easy to use | Great job | False info, wrong info & missing details. Then the fees...outrageous cleaning and airbnb fee, which is like adding 2-4 more days. On top of that, there are terms like ""Prior to your departure, please tidy up the condo by doing the following: Remove all perishable items and leave trash in trash room. Load & start dishwasher. Leave used towels and bed sheets on kitchen island. Additional fees will be imposed if condo is in unsatisfactory condition."" What is cleaning fee for? 😕👎 | Haven't completed yet. | Very easy to find a holiday home, share it with members 9f my family and book. | Great and helpful with resolvingvreservations | No offers | ""Update your trip details to get accurate pricing and more"" I tried to book a month in Sacramento and now no listings are able to be booked. I need to book ASAP. PLEASE FIX THIS | Very trustable and useful details | Excellent experience. | ::. ? | Always a pleasure to use the Airbnb app. Payment options are great and easy to use as well as reviews are right there. Only wish Airbnb fees would decrease. ❤️😊 | User friendly | My family and I had a horrible experience, support wasn't helpful at all, we asked for a refund due misleading info on a ""duplex"" considered as a house we wanted a full house but the filter on the app doesn't work properly and gave us this apartment/unit, plus the host didn't replied our messages when they offered 24/7 help/communication. Trying to get support help thru the app was such a nightmare, several calls, messages, closed cases, we didn't get refunded at alI, I don't recommend it. | So far I m waiting for I r a response but the prices so far are much better then a hotel | The airbnb cancelled my reservation making my family stay in the cold in Canada. If you are unsure of some certainty you should make contact with the host if there is any violation not just giving unnecessary heartache to their customers. Imagine letting a 1 year old twin spend the night in the cold and knowing fully that even they make a refund the bank will always take their charges which make things work . This is the worst experience of my life . There should be live verifications to see . | They allow inadequate descriptions of listings and additionally continually close support tickets if you are not the primary guest affected. Beware if you are a disabled individual- you'll probably be left to sort this out on your own. | Drama bgt utk verifikasi akun | The actual charge to maybank sg credit card is 1 percent higher than airbnb receipt price. Host asked me to check with airbnb. Airbnb asked me to check with bank. Its probably treated as foreign charge though receipt was made out in sgd. Just factor that in your costs. | great app | Excellent | Straight forward. | UX on zero level. Works very slow. You have to wait ages to see photos. You can't zoom in any photo. Weird filter, I still don't understand type of accommodation I should choose. There is endless list of such things. It seems that developers don't use it by themselves at all. | Booking got canceled taking long time to receive refund | VERY HELPFULL IN FINDING A SUITABLE VACATION TRIP | Thats its so easy to use | Your fee should be a simple flat rate not an alternating rate due to the price it's completely ridiculous where it jumping from 40 to 140+ because some charge little more for "" rent"" and you don't do anything different from property to property its all the same this makes hotels more appealing again | Too much unnecessary steps | Total fraud | Exceptional | They stole $400 from me | Great prices and availability | Never been disappointed | Love planning my trips with Airbnb! Convenient and easy and I can usually find very affordable places to stay. I also love it because I always meet wonderful people/hosts during my stay. | Works fine for me with no issues. | Easy to use but, the calender needs addressing when we have to put on our date of birth. I was born in Feb 1955 and I have to constantly click back to get to that day, month and year. | Good app | So easy to use and details are really clear | Cool app | I was looking for the perfect rental house in Charleston, SC. It is so easy to use and find homes. In less than five minutes after booking, I already received a link for restaurants and shopping experiences. Thanks for making my reservation so easy! | Great | I've stayed here several times. Excellent accommodations and top notch service. I will definitely be returning for multiple visits. | Ridiculous service fees | Another quick, easy booking, thanks | The app is amazing. I've met some great people and find the best places to stay. | Hooray! They finally fixed the problem with the (in)ability to mark messages as read. Whatever issues you may have with Airbnb (the service), the app is very functional for both hosts and travelers. | Great room | Clear and fast booking | Not a good website to book on | Very easy and fast to find a place and reserve a place for an upcoming family trip to Portugal | Easy look ups and love the comfort of knowing Airbnb has everyone's back during the rental process. | Stupid app that can't verify my phone number. Need to try again in 24 hours. Then how am I supposed to book a room if I urgent?? | Airbnb is my 1st choice! | I have met some of the coolest people on this platform! My favorite way to stay! | Airbnb is very easy to use, and such a good alternative to expensive and impersonal hotels worldwide. Their staff seems very helpful. | Found a great place at a great price. Thank you! It's all the added fees that hike up your bill. | Easy booking process. Transparent fees. I love the many options Airbnb offers ranging from rooms within homes to entire properties. | Very good security checks when paying for accommodation | Never use Airbnb, they allow a host to charge for fraudulent damages and then remove negative reviews to keep host ratings high. Stay at a hotel at all costs as opposed to using Airbnb. | Horrible experience, I took the time to pay for the stay, but had some unforseen circumstances limit me from actually being able to stay there, but since it was my first to using the service, I did not see the fact that I wasn't able to be refunded the amount I paid (17 of 316 was refunded to me😐) I did not enter the premises and I also contacted them IN advance to let them know I would not be staying there. I hate this app for lack of consideration/apathetic consideration. NEVER AGAIN! | It won't finish updating | Great app | Great acco.modation and easy booking | My favorite place to book | Always a great experience! | very easy to use and contact the owner in advance. | Deberian pedirle a los host que sean mas honestos en cuanto a los alrededores de sus rentals. | easy way | Love this app!! Love airbnb. Please use this thing u wouldn't regret it guys promise | Won't let me log in with correct code and mobile number. Providing the code it's sending to my mobile and its not accepting the code saying something went wrong, not I'm locked out, can't contact anyone as if wants me to sign in. Absolute garbage. | I am unable to get loggedin. It always shows that your session has expired. I uninstalled and installed it again, but the same issue. | Always a good experience. | Airbnb support ambassador Greg, in my case, was a phenomenal person, helped me through a cancelation (from the host), and getting the new reservation. | Won't download at all | Dope | Always great | I am a patient costumer. The list of problems endless. Even 3 guys from costumer service give up. Unbelievable but they didn't answer. Language change not possible. Messages after answering no more visible available. Until they reply. Details on the Inserat can not be changed. No access to the Inserat. Second Inserat vanished. Not possible add important therm by creating a Inserat. Such as minimum days staying or check in out times. Afterwards not possible do changes. Service didn't respond | Much much better than VRBO | Thank God 💗 | It's just simply fantastic! :) :) we travel quite a lot and we use it EVERYWHERE in the world we go 👍🙂 can't imagine booking a hotel/hostel since we've discovered Airbnb (which was actually quite a while ago anyways, probably 8-9 years..). | Great experience | Great app | Excellent app! My only suggestion for hosting would be to add an option where you can have a variable availability option. For example, my normal availability is every day, but for a week I will be out of town and still want to rent the place so I make just that week a 1 week minimum. | Intuitive, easy to use UI! | Good. Easy to use. | Lately has been buggy, I don't get any sort of notifications when I get inquiries which I hope is going to be sorted out before the tourist season arrives. Edit: Can't enter sum over 3 digits as a special offer for guests. Keeps getting worse and worse | EXCELLENT | This is my first time ever trying to use Airbnb and I will never in my life use them again. I cannot believe I have had the experience that I've had in the last week we rented a house that said it had a hot tub they refunded us but then my Airbnb app would not work to reserve anything else so we decided to let my mom make her an Airbnb account and she rented this beautiful place that we were so excited to get here we are 4 days later and her account is now locked Airbnb is canceled.💔💔💔💔 | Bunch of clowns 🤡 | Good | Absolute love booking with Airbnb. I have comfort in knowing that my vacation is in good hands with them. I've been using them for over 15 years. They have never disappointed me. | Absolutely love air bnbs it's like a real great option for families..I always suggest when booking to select a superhost their hospitality is always great and the amenities as well | Used to love Airbnb, but the fees are out of control like our $400 booking jumping to $800 after service fees, cleaning fees, etc. | Very good, very easy to book | Calculation of distance could be an option. | Hassel free app. awesome | Love that I can split my payments up. Great website | My wife and I used the app to book a place a week ago she registered her account. I did not. It was a great experience. So I wanted to show a co-worker the place we stay. Now it's my turn to register. When I had to enter my Birthday the app wanted me to swipe through 46 years of calanders to selected my Birthday. Lol unless I'm just to old to figure out to enter the numeric values of my birthday via keyboard. But I'm not going to scroll through every monthly calanders for the last 46 years. | I made account last year for trip to go on my birthday, as soon as I booked 1 place, they took my money and banned my account. This app is scam. I didn't even went on a trip because they did banned me for no reason and costumer services won't help either. I couldn't even use this app from the beginning with and they took my $700+ and banned my account. | The management takes the word of the host over the customer. However i have proven my reviews and my reports by screen shots , videos & photos . They still took the host side who falsely reported an issue against me as he requested extra money than what was stated in the App . The app management doesnt recheck after the hosts and the service level were completely dishonest | Very user friendly app. | Habe kaution und miete überwiesen jetzt ist mein geld weg absolut unseriös | Only 2 people can travel. Take me off list. | Very difficult to use the search function. Cannot get precise location. Always give me suggestions from other country. Map function also difficult to see the street names | Very Professional and Supportive, Need to be fascinating for Customers to the vendors | Easy to use | Its all good until its time to pay the hosts thats when stories come up ...of different excuses with verification that takes forever....yet customer is already checked in... remember like a hotel customer is supposed to pay before using your facilities but here u have to wait for over a week before your money come yet customer is already using the service..not fair for small time hosts...never a conclusive answer..why wait to verify when host has a customer...why was it not done before | Easy to use, only had good hosts All sweet as. | Exceptional | Such an easy app to use and hosts reply quickly when needed 10/10 | Very easy to use..It's my first time using it hope will have a great experience when we there🙏😊 | Good , easy to use | You can't see what you're typing when you're chatting on the app, It's extremely frustrating! | Great experience, however all those hosting their properties need to be compulsorily rated by guests to give a true picture | After our last experience we will never go arbnb again The company didn't seem to care but did refund us an 84 dollar cleaning charge. So big of them. | I absolutely love airbnb it so useful for travelers very good prices and places | Awesome, easy to use this app. 😮 | Nice and easy, price clear. | Always the best experience in here❤️ | I'm loving the whole Airbnb experience it's been very helpful and productive for me! I recommend this app and service to Future guests and hosts | Easy to navigate. | Still good!!! | So far so Good | A little disappointed with the first individual. Let's see how it goes with Armando | Amazing application, well made and maintained. | Works well for me | I love this App | They took my money before they decided they didn't want to do business with me, and then refused to refund my money in a timely fashion. Now they are telling me 15 days for a refund. That was all the money i had for a stay. So now, I don't get a vacation. Thanks AirBnB. | Required note to host isn't a good idea. | Very poor customer service | Good | Great way to book a stay as well help other book a stay at my place. | Very good set-up | User friendly app | The ID verification is the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced. It does not matter how many times I do this, it never seems to go through. I don't even look that different from the ID picture, but even if, there doesn't seem to be a solution, I've seen posts with a similar situation... From 4 years ago! Is there ever going to be a solution? I would never recommend using airbnb for that reason | Loved this app | Cant see location of plac your booking allowing hosts to put up misleading pictures | Easy to use, for searches and booking. | 👍 | No option to turn off split stays. Split stays significantly increases costs because it is actually two separate reservations. That means you have to pay all fees, including cleaning fees, twice! You have to check out of one reservation at 10:00 a.m. and then wait somewhere and check into the second reservation after 4:00 p.m. so now you have wasted a precious day of vacation. | Ease of use | La atención al cliente es pésima. Y si el apartamento no existe y es una estafa se lavan las manos. | Easy & quick | They put me and my partner in a apartment from hell from leaking washing machine, lizards,smell of garbage, dirty apartment, violence in hall way,bugs etc Airbnb won't do nothing about it don't be fooled from the pictures of Description my partner was all cut up but thank goodness she didn't break her leg worst have never experienced this before the money I paid ought get far better. Airbnb won't help advise you be careful with Airbnb and where you stay . | Easy to use | Easy to use | Have trouble downloading the posters | I enjoy using the Airbnb app, through this app I can find places/stays that are affordable and safe. | Download it for the first time then made a reservation and it asked me to verify my identity then got stuck on the same page for 10 minutes with the ""checking"" symbol looping | SENSATIONAL | Easy to use. All information clearly shown and pictures were great. | App has too many checks to go through without using already approved Google app approvals. | Easy and fast right in your on home.

Android 14. The optional theme on the phone is dark, as I understand the app tries to set itself, but it's really messed up (partly dark, the text impossible to read). To get the light theme I have to reset the phone. This is irritating. Everything else is fine. I use Airbnb everytime I need to find a comfortable stay-in for a trip."",""This app could be a whole lot better. When you search on the map, if you don't have the right kind house/rental selected in that area it won't show you what airbnb is there. But if you change the kind in that area the map goes to a different place. I love STAYING at airbnbs but to find them is very frustrating because of the un-userfreindliness of the app."",""I spend a good portion of each year living out of short term rentals and Airbnb has the largest selection of quality options. However, finding those options is exceptionally difficult. The lack of useful search filters and inability to sort search results is incredibly frustrating. The categories are ridiculous and useless. With every update we lose more filters. It's as if the designers of this app go out of their way to make searching for listings as difficult as possible."",""This app has gone downhill in the last few months. On the conversation screen, the keyboard overlaps the text box so you can't check what you're typing. Some text boxes don't auto capitalize text. I'm getting a pop-up to set up my home as a host. I don't own a home... Notification indicators also sometimes don't update in the app. Message notifications are not dismissed when a message is read inside the app. Definitely needs a strong bug fixing push."",""There are full screen pop up ads asking me, I think, to list my house on Airbnb. I don't own a house. There is no reason to show me this ad multiple times when I'm just trying to use your app, and this is completely unacceptable. On top of that there are many other issues making the app near unusable.

There is strategy in what generator you choose to spend your energy on. Ads while present aren't required viewing to progress | I'm beginning to be obsessed with this game | Nice | Don't like the new updated art supplies. Only get painting supplies and not the others unfortunately | Rather socially interactive, and well laid out. | Pretty fun freemium game. It has the standard formula, make things happen, which costs energy, run out of energy, wait for energy to refill, repeat. You can pay to top up your energy. I'm sure the higher will take FOREVER to get done. The game plays well and looks good. It's easy to play and get into the meat of it. Minus 2 stars for not having any music. No music in a time-killer game is a huge quality issue. Games like this always have good music. | I had it installed on my old phone and wanted to try playing it again but it doesn't load and keeps saying contact support?? I've tried troubleshooting and uninstall and reinstalling and nothing works. Very disappointed | Ok for a merger game not really into them though | Fun | Keeps quitting a lot can't play I have upgraded WiFi should not be having any problems. | Awesome game | Nice relaxinf game. Not a bunch of stupid ads, not bothered constantly with sales. Can upgrade and do in-game purchases if you want but also get free tries after a certain period of time (throttled). I like it. | If you want to limit your screen time/ game addiction this is the game. Like all the other comments say you have to wait 2m for each energy. And one energy is one move. It let's you watch ads only 3Xs for 25 energy or so. After that you have to wait 2m for the next move. 100 is the max energy. And you can't do much with that. I'm only tolerating this because of the Fetch app. I'm not the type to waste cash on phone games either. | Nice game. | It's not fun after the last updates.(( | The game is addictive but there's too many item to merge but the energy is too less. Hard to finish an order as not enough energy. Should increase it | Not sure why games that encourage you to spend less time on them are becoming the norm, but this is one of them. You get maybe 5 minutes of game play before you have to either wait 2 hours to play again or give them money. Just a money grab. Don't waste your time. | 😍🥰🥰😍 | The game was great until the upgrade twice now I have reached combining the king with top fishing rod and each time no fairground ticket it just disappeared off the board !! | It's so boring game | Love it | Awesome | Why would you make an update that makes the game harder to play? i hate the new Art Supply. Fix it. | Sicc | Looks like it would be fun to play. Til you realize it's total ""pay to play""! You need energy to play, gems to buy energy, real cash to buy gems. No way to earn gems or coins in-game with the option to purchase. It's straight up you wanna play you gotta pay. Don't waste your time or money it's not that great. | Was fun for a while. Too many high rarity items as orders. Take days to fulfill one order now without paying for energy. Takes too long to complete an order now and the reward for the lower rarity items are not worth the energy. | Fun | عااااااالی | Thank you | I'm having trouble starting my new game. I have no coin or gameplay, even though I paid for gems. I've played this before and know how it's played. I would look Iike some help please. | The problem is it is addictive and 10 diamonds is high enough for 100 energy, why does it have to change from 10, 20, 40 you are ripping people off. | Very very nice game 🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍❤️ | Graphics are bright and colorful. STORYLINE is funny. There are lots of things to merge! My beach stay cation. | Terrible experience . Doesn't even deserve the star . Why is it even on Playstore ...Uninstalled | The game keeps crashing. If I open my cards, the game immediately crashes and even when normally playing, it'll sometimes hang and then crash. So far, no adjustments has been made, I can't trade my cards anymore as the game won't stay open for 2 minutes | Great game but I don't like the long chats between upgrades | Very addictive and fun 😁 | 👞💀😪👞💀💀 | It is very fun and addictive. I also love how it helps me unwind and feel relaxed. | Challenging | Love this game! I like that you match two instead of 3. I like that you get a decent amount of energy to complete orders, and it refills quickly compared to some. Nice job! | I like this game so far .just started playing it a few hours ago | Good | I don't like this update, and how it's changed things with no explanation. | Nice | It's just way too difficult... It has sadly the same problem every merge game has, it just unplayable if you are ahead in the story. It's nearly impossible to get the right stuff because of limited energy, reloading of the generators. | Good Game | Not a big big fan of waiting for my energy, fell up, | Fun | Very engaging! | Easy | I don't know why this game is not loading. It goes to 100% and again 99% It keeps on doing this and the game never starts I hate this game (if anyone of you is having the same technical issue please tell me) | Great 😊😂 fun | I think I'm on level 14....so far, so good! Fun and challenging. | Enjoying the game so far expensive fire trying to talk my wife and my kids into playing at 2 | Fun | Great | I love this game it is so fun | So much fun when playing | Love playing this game!!!! | Horrible | Good game | I can't play it at all it will not go to 100 percent for me to play it what's going on | Fun | If the number of energies increased with the levels passed it would help . But as the levels go up its harder to get things done unless you spend money. | Deadly awesome great game | Good ok | Great | Fun Good graphics | Quite challenging just that the part that requires you buy energy if fully exhausted is frustrating. Aside that, it's great! | A nice little time waster. | This game is uselee, its stuck right at the start . What a waste ... please sort it out now!!!!! | Download the game because of Monopoly go. Supposed to get a reward if you complete the level nine I completed level 9 and not get reward they say I have to redownload and do it all over again. And the game is not that very interesting. | I have never played a game that didn't work! I'm probably going to delete. | I felt you were fussing to play a game or to download one | It's glitches so much I can't even complete move then 10 moves before it boots me out. I love playing this game but the technical issues sucks they need to be fix before I change my rating of the game | Lot's of fun! Apart from driving me crazy trying to complete my collection's this keeps you occupied and interested for ages. Lot's to do and lot's to think about. | Great | Cool | Was good, but now, not so much. After level 50, it's impossible to complete daily tasks as the items required use so many lives to create Even if you do buy additional lives they're used up within a few minutes and you still require more. Always getting cards I already have too, rarely any new ones. Will delete the game if things don't change soon. | Love this game. | It free good good game thank you | The game is good, you didn't have to Wait allot to get life to keep playing. Nice | Cool 8 | Absolutely love it | Love this game | Very simple | Fun | Constantly crashes. I literally have only been able to play once | Im obsessed | Fun game | Fun and challenging. Give it a try. | Works great good for the youngens | There are to many adds I don't like this | Great game | Lots of fun. Keep your mind going. Good brain exercise | Loaded today.. LOVE I just made almost 5.00 in less 20min! HOWEVER haven't cashed out yet.. hoping more selections of game's, not into these ""Farmville"" types.. I'll update later | Love the merging games fun and enjoyable | I didn't download this app | Good story love the merge and selling | I love the game it's quite addictive actually, But it's cruel that we can't trade Golden cards, that needs to change. AND THE FACT THAT YOU CANT PLAY OFFLINE IS A DOWN SIDE. | Super entertaining | Love it | Very fun | Very addicting game! What I like the most is that there are no ads! (as far as I can remember) | A fun ,relaxing game do recomend | It's great! The merging properties and all the stuff is great! I just wish that the more you upgrade things the better luck you'll have. Great game though!! | I enjoy playing this game. | It's fun and I'm really enjoying myself. | Regular merge system. Energy cap and regen ok but quests items are too high level, which makes you starve for energy anyway. You get ads thrown at you until you say stop. | Fantastic! | Edited: The items which are rare, their rewards should be much more compared to how they are now. Please fix it. Also rewards should be proportional to the amount of time and energy that are required for production. Also the energy should be 2000 as it's becoming tougher to clear the levels & the rewards are lesser compared to before. So I don't know what is that you all are thinking? | Very fun with surprise rewards 😊 | Cool | I liked the game in the beginning but then it really sucked when you only get 100 to make things I think you should get 200 or more because 100 is gone in a few clicks so I deleted it | Fun game, wish it reloaded coins faster | Ads include inappropriate apps recommended for MA 17 and up | It's a good game just run out of energy quick | Just Fun! A great little game that does what it says on the tin. Great fun, great graphics and clear instructions too. | Really enjoying this game | Very relaxing,a great way to pass time. love it! | This is a pretty good challenging game | Startastic!!!🌟⭐🌟⭐🌟⭐🤩🤩🤩 | Cool game | It was super fun at first, then it got tedious, and today when I updated the app, it no longer works. Nothing is loading or populating or responding to me. So, I guess it's time to uninstall. | Love the game but my purchased energy and ""diamonds"" keep disappearing while the game is off. The progress is saved but not the energy needed to play. Can't get ahold of developers to get answers as their contact email won't go through, can't delete the game without jumping through a million hoops. Don't recommend this app/game. | The recharging system is so dumb | Great | This is a great game, lots of great people who play but they're unfair with side games you get to watch on in misery as others are having fun while you feel left out it really let's the game down and its making alot of my friends i made want to quit 😔 | I love this game especially the card albums and the great people I've met because of it, if it wasn't for the fact that not everyone gets the side games which I think is really unfair and makes alot of people sad watching others get to play and they can't it would of got a higher rating. | Great game | This game is awesome and the best ever. I love it | Graphics and design or great | Great but there's a glitch where items are turning invisible..not game breaking but annoying | Is a great game I really like it | It is very addictive and simple to understand | The game is good. I am enjoying this game while I get bored I loved to play this game | A fun casual merge game that lets you build up a town with each level you clear. | It takes time to complete all the item, maybe we can shorten the time so that many can enjoy the game, make it easy and less spending | Good game , fun | It's challenging, I love it! | Plz give more ads for energy and merge items😊. Too much tasks but less energy levels how can possible for next levels | Love this game!!! | I only downloaded this game to get the reward incentive on a survey site. 2 weeks later, and I am now addicted to it!! | Brilliant and addictive | I love this game because it is tricky but helpful. | I love this game however on th le latest update I did the game will not open now? I've been trying for two days. | You can enjoy it without actually spending cash. It's about time we had a game like that. | lov this app | Addictive game, fun concept Changes of the items could use a little more explanation, Like the toolbox when you get those I didn't realize that it was a thing that gives important stuff! | Can't put it down | A fun game | Love the game | Takes a lot of steps to merge items. I've been trying to get to a bruschetta for over a month! It makes the game hard to enjoy because it takes so long, and there are some items you can't get unless you use gems to get them. The daily rewards are hard to get as well so you struggle to replace what you use. | I love it it has a little ads barely any and it is just so satisfying. Hope I have great advice on why you should download this game it will be fun and you will play it all day long. 😂... Please download it it's a great and fun masterpiece. | Great game | Really fun! You merge things to fulfill orders, to get coins, to build your land up! Love it so far! | Super fun ga | Fun with lots of surprises | The most boring and annoying app ever | I like this game so far, but hard to advance as it takes along time to aquire coins | Goid stress relief and helps me relax, their should be more games like this. 🥰🥰🥰 Updates and bugs fixes | Love it | It's fun, didn't really think I would like it but I do | Fun roll playing game | 👌 | It was a fun game.I was addicted to this game. Now it takes lots and lots of energy to complete one order.. If we complete that order , the same order repeats for many times..and it's gets boring. Now I just waste my energy at sometimes.....too disappointed...but thanks to that , I can play other games .. | It's the best game | Easy | Can't put it down! | علی | Sometimes I will watch an ad to gain an item. I watch it all the way through but the game never grants me my item. Sometimes I'll come back to the game and stuff is missing from the board. | Nice merging game! | Very enjoyable | Lots of different parts of the game to keep it interesting and goal driven. Love it | Travel Town is a fun merging game and the concept is very entertaining but it is very costly to play and which makes it frustrating waiting for energy or buying some.... Wish there was a way to get energy without paying for it ..... | ❤️❤️❤️👍🏼😊 | Please play this game it is so fun it was a bit boring at first but then it was fun I recommend this game for you PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE BORED!!!!!!!!!! | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ATTN!!!! This is my 2nd rating for this game. This is my new favorite game my absolute favorite!!!!! It's challenging, there are a lot of rewards, the graphics are pretty and it's very relaxing. I don't spend a lot of money on the game because I haven't found a need to. With patience and strategy has managed to get pretty far in the game. If you're looking for fun and excitement and a relaxing game download this game today you won't be disappointed. YOU'LL LOVE IT TOO 😃 | Loved it. Until I realized I can't get ahead. It's one that's stacked against you. Too much time waiting for energy. Daily tasks are basically unattainable so you can't get any bonuses. I found this game through Fetch Play. I'm gonna Max out my points and delete. Sucks too because the concept of this game I could literally play all day. I wouldn't complain about more free plays with ads. | Very fun | 4Madison 2015 | لعبة ممتعة أقترح امكانية التبادل للبطاقة الذهبية بأن تكون مقابل شخصين بما ان بإمكانا ارسال مرتين في اليوم او زيادة عدد الاشخاص الذين نستطيع الارسال لهم اقترح أيضاً جعل جوائز للطاقة لا نهائية لمدة نصف ساعة او ساعة كما في بعض الألعاب عندما نحصل على قلوب لا نهائية لبعض الوقت كجوائز نفوز بها ببعض المهام | 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 love this gameee..sooo addictive | Nice game | Fun | FUN GAME! | Please, I've been unable to login to the app all through yesterday, please fix the issue.. | I enjoy these games. I wish it were easier to get more energy, though.

What I find disrespectful is that they have an algorithm where if you spend money they increase the cost of everything until you go about a week without purchases, then they offer low prices. They need to offer better rewards for people that spend cash. There's also an issue where they seem to always give you more items that you never need. Not a coincidence, burns energy fast."",""Travel Town started as a fun matching game, then became challenging, then a waste of time. Minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 6-10 matching items before it recharges again. Over time,more matching items are needed to complete your order. You end up more waiting than playing. Of course, you can use gems to speed process, but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Power maximum is 100 and disappears quickly. Get rid of recharging. Thx"",""It's a fun game on the surface, but is the least giving when it comes to energy of any merge game I've played. Daily tasks are borderline extremely difficult if you're not setting timers for when your energy recharges or something. I'm lucky to complete one big item in a full day. It's an issue many merge games have and a few things have been added to combat that grind, but not nearly enough. It was fun for a few weeks or so."",""Don't download unless you have a lot of time. It's very addictive! Ads are well spaced. Every now and then an ad will not load right but when you exit the game and go back in you are right where you left off. All in all it's one of my favorite games. Refreshing to get a good one after so many fakes and duds. Challenging yet simple. After level 35 be ready for major $ and mega hours to complete a level. Took too long and I lost interest trying to move levels. Honestly guys you had IT for a while."",""The game is very responsive and fun to play. There is no lag when merging and the graphics and colors are pleasing to look at. My biggest issue with this game, and the reason it's getting 2 stars is simply that there appears to be a disconnect between the developers and their customer base. The good packs for energy and gems are locked behind a pricey pay wall. $17.99 if I run out of energy is a huge amount to pay for a merge game and the rewards spend too fast to be worth it. I'd rather see ads""]",false,false,false,"io.randomco.travel","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.randomco.travel&hl=en&gl=us"

I've used this app since 2012/13, no more."",""The New View is Terrible! Primarily for esthetics and functionality, please return to the previous format. Feels like an MS-DOS search. This was the best app for finding destinations. Part of the selection process involved seeing pictures of the destinations/prices and plugging in timeframes based on that. Now you dont see any of those things. Takes you straight to a calender??? The whole purpose of the app is to not HAVE to choose a date for your vacation."",""Years ago, I found great flights on this app. I travel US to Europe. Now, all the cheapest providers that pop up are some BS companies nobody has ever heard of, with lots of negative reviews. No thank you. This app is now nothing but a waste of time. Uninstalling. Here's a tip: Every time I have flown for the last twenty years or so, Expedia has had the best deals and I booked through them. (For me, it's regular flights, no hotel or car, no last minute or standby.) Always a great experience."",""Out dated App. I used to use this as my go to flight search for booking overseas. I would promote it with my family and friends for years. Then this past year- year n half it's gone downhill. It claims I can get a flight for X amount when I click to book suddenly doubles or triples in price. Never did that before. I don't trust it anymore and honestly have just been using other mainstream apps since those work. Gave up after the mainstream ones gave better deals.

After you reservation fails, you'll have to jump through multiple hoops to get a refund of you paid in advance. Avoid for last minute bookings."",""The app works well, but the discounts suck. Also, they only give discounts while you're already vacationing, and by the time you're off vacation the discounts are no longer valid.

Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred...

He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential. If you could export to a cvs or cvv for spreadsheet that would be amazing | New version won't let me sign in. | Very helpful while travelling , and you have a busy schedule | ever since giogle stopped trips, I have been lost. trip-it saved me | Lets have an app scan your entire mailbox for 'just your travel data' aha ... Because that's bound to end well, with the inevitable data breach... | Works well. Easy to use. | excellent | ❤️ | Doesn't work at all anymore. Can't even login, keeps giving me an error | great | Must improved since last I rated it two stars in 2017. It however has slipped again. My properly imported rental car plans always randomly change between filed and unfiled. This makes things difficult when using the widgets | Too many bugs | Great for documenting your confirmations for airline, car rentals, dinner reservations, but not for planning a trip. I was hoping this app would replace Roadtrippers for me. | used it once before and found it again. worth the money for the pro version | Love the fact that you can make a very detailed itinarary with a visual timeline that makes it easy to keep track of everything. | THE BEST travel organiser app. | Best app 👌 | Everything I book or event attended is added to Tripit for future reference. | Very helpful in keeping track of everything on a trip in terms of flight status and hotel confirmation. I've been using it for years and never had any problems. | Impressive but not perfect. Need to add feature of more than one email address because not all my travel info goes to the same email address. | The app has been great but just stopped working. When I try to log in it just says access denied | great product keeping all travel details together | No search function (iOS has it). Flighty level details would be nice. They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world 🌎 and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers. | Hello. I can't invite participants via email. A message appears that the requested email cannot be attached at this time. The point is that there are emails with which there is no problem and there are those that do. I did a few tries and it seems to be completely random. There was an attempt with two emails that managed to connect and the second time, with the same two emails, I couldn't. How can it be fixed? | Excellent! | make my travel easier | The pro version is a must for frequent travelers - it makes your travel logistics much smoother! Basic things like letting you know gates changes to baggage pickup carousel numbers before airlines / FIDs can. Subscription cost paid for it self for me when it alerted me when a cheaper rate rate on same flight came up, with clear instructions on how to secure. It worked and saved me hundreds for our family vacation! Update: now saved my thousands over the years with the Fare Tracket! | Good yahha | Great . | it's very easy to use and links easily to trips. but I can't seem to set custom picture for trips which isn't great. I tried following their directions but it still doesn't work. | Keeps on signing me out and then having to reset my password and won't let me sign in on more than one device which is a pity as the app looks good | love it!! | Extremely helpful | The application is excellent, but unfortunately, I have encountered a technical issue where it repeatedly crashes. | The app will not let me log in. I Created a password but the app freezes when I tap the submit button. | App was recently updated and google login no longer works in app (does in website). | cool travel 🧳 app | Useless | such a great app. we travel a lot and it's indispensible | My flight on American Airlines was delayed twice and AA rebooked me on a different connection, but TripIt Pro never updated my itinerary, even many hours later. | Live & die by this app for travel, domestic & international. I've been using the app for over a decade. | does has list of all the cities and station in India | Very useful for trip planning!!! | Could be better | Love this app, mad glitchy though. Only thing is, when you share the itinerary with someone's email some details are left out. And they can only get an updated list of plans if you resend it via email or download the app. | Upgraded to the newest version and my past & future trips that were in the system have all disappeared. Have had multiple issues logging in from the mobile app, it opens the login into a browser then doesn't connect after entering all login info. | Crashes and does not save the IT I was trying to add. | Verry bad | 1-2024, keep getting denied access from phone and laptop. 11-2022 Not saving any itineraries correctly and supper buggy; keeps crashing. When it works it's great 👍 | I have two long trips coming up, each involving a couple of train journeys and a couple of ferries. It got the dates right for one of them, and was off by a year for the other. It didn't pick the ferries up at all, and only found one of the train journeys. I'll stick with paper printouts. | For some reason, the app does not open and does not load once I enter my username and password; I can only use it on the website not on the app ; I have a Xiaomi 12 Pro. | App crahsing | I'm unable to sign into the app. I can sign into the desktop version. however, when I try signing in via the app it says ""an unexpected error has occured"". | Super helpful. | Horrible customer service!!! (or lack of) have deleted it after three emails with tech issues and no one getting back | Very handy app, the import function via email works well. Would be good if you could show a trip as cancelled status but leave it in the list so you can keep the details for future reference. | a great way to organize your trips. super easy to use and convenient | excellent app for keeping itineraries, tickets, bookings ect. | I love how easy it is to find all my travel info. Trip it not only automatically pulls the relevant info, but it also organizes my trip into an itinerary. My husband and I both use the app, and since he travels for work a lot, he can just forward info, and it gets organized by TripIt, and I can access it if necessary. | Don't waste your time with this one. It's a pay yearly at a very high price. Save the the money for your trip, there are better apps out there. | best travel app ever | very convenient aop! | Lousy app | Can't install nor update in Japan | Keeps crushing on a galaxy s22 ultra. On Huawei 30 pro works and I like it | This app has been very helpful in keeping track of my travel plans. I've only used the free version so far but will probably upgrade in the future | going to be using it on upcoming family vacation. Used it for a mini vacation and I never lost track of our plans and tickets or even confirmation numbers.

I thought that almost everything would be free,atleast let us watch an ad to get the airport free for twenty-four hours; it’s better than not having the airport there for you to not use it.

Seriously, it's closed UNTIL 2026. That's part of the reason I was looking for an app with suggestions. The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City™ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan. Even after deleting the whole itenary it doesnt refresh the updated itenary. Very bad app experience. Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Job👍 | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing 😍 | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | tốt | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for. | This app/company will add your email address to spam lists with no authorization, so don't use any of the SSO options when you launch it! How trashy. Don't start emailing me your newsletter just because I opened your app one time. | good experience in yelanaka oon bikes the feedback related vehicle are good, the way of approch towards the costumer was brilliant , the vehicle are well maintained with proper fueling in the bike that I have took overall experience was good | Creating new plans and editing existing ones could be easier, but it offers a wonderful service | Really great app for planning a visit somewhere. So many options!!! I just wish I could connect my trip accounts (hotels, flights, etc) for points and discounts. Also, it would be nice to see AAA or military discounts. Excellent app and I'm excited for this application's future! | was this a joke | I can not use the app, appear google notifc. Of loc. And I cant use | Love the website. But the App is not working. Android 12. Just white screen when I open it. | Deeply unimpressed. I had already put together my itinerary of Amsterdam and very few of the places were listed and some were in the wrong place. | ok so far | Happy so far even the app looks like iOS. Probably Flutter tech. I will do 5 stars if I can manage to mark as visited the attractions. | Permission hogger. If I say no to the location permission, it means no. Spamming it, will not change my mind. | Nice app, very easy to create an itinerary and to find great places to visit. Needs some improvement when changing the day within an itinerary. | All the app can give you is paid places tours. Nothing like real travel plans. | For your day tours, couldn't you include (or at least have it as option) a STOP FOR LUNCH??!!....then resuming the tour in the afternoon?? | nice app to use when planning a trip. They show a diverse assortment of activities in each city. I especially like that they have trip planning by day and desired level of activity. 1, 2 or 3 days plans. | Doesn't even work on my new tablet but good on PC or phone! | Great trip planner for international travelers. | Such an amazing tool, don't leave home without it! | Excellent tool for travel | I've used in 10+ cities and it's great for planning day-to-day activities and staying organized, and also finding things to do on the fly. It's really helpful that you can add other plans, like visiting friends, theatre tickets, etc. and find things to do based on your location so they're easy to walk to. My only complaint is when creating plans from a wishlist, it prioritizes location over operating hours - what's the point of getting somewhere efficiently if it's closed when you get there? | perfect app to plan your own tour or get private tours. Very helpful. | Location permission Pop up never goes away. That's so enoying. | All my plans disappeared after opening on the web | Not impressed by this app at all. I was expecting to be able to add sites in the cities I am visiting so I could plan the best route to see everything. Unfortunately, everything in this app was geared toward booking tours. I understand that they need to make money and, if you are looking to book a bunch of tours I'm sure this is great, but this is not what I was looking for. Huge disappointment. | Nice | Formerly useful app. This app allows you to plan a multi-day itinerary in some detail. You can take one of their plans and move attractions around to suit. Just a few small improvements would help: 1) Ten day trip maximum is too short 2) Should allow a fixed time for reservations 3) Should be able to change hotels to allow a multi-city trip UPDATE 2022-08 Sorry to say app and Web now useless as some recent reviews have noted. Zero stars | very helpful app for making effective use of your time in a city | Very helpful app, but a number of glitches and needed features make it a 3 star rating. | Just an app selling overpriced tours. Better to do a little research by your self. | Great app | Great idea - shockingly poor execution It's like first draft. Changes times & days in my plan. Unable to move them back. Can't add ANYTHING that's not on their list. Forced to have events one after another, as if I'm not allowed a break. Very frustrating & unnecessary | Music tour | Great idea, really helpful but UI is not intuitive at all! It's frustrating to use as I can quite add 1 day guides per day, but then it's over writing them. Just really confusing! | it's a good app | Keeps freezing | Exceptional. I downloaded map and managed to use it in offline mode. No need to ask others how to reach places. | I was really enjoying the app, I'm going on a trip in 2 weeks and it really helped me to organise things, I paid for tickets through the app and the money has left my bank and now the app has crashed. What do I do? | the app won't open... otherwise I love the app. please fix it | not working, exactly when i need it, with locally dowloaded data, every page is an error page | Please check after new update..the app is not working...I tried reinstalling many times but no luck...could you help me with that.. | Worthless now that it only works for booking tours | top app, incredibly useful. highly recommended | design your itinerary like a pro | Nice apps | brilliant app. | I used this app all over Italy. it's great! | Great idea! | Expensive and limited activities. Sometimes there are only 6 activities even though the place has more to offer. Other apps are better. | Excellent travel tool! | Tried using the app to plan a trip to Malta. The only plans it comes up with is for Valetta. Pretty disappointed. | nice app | Well organized and friendly app | My guide wherever I go. Use it to plan in advance for my trips and get the best deals | Excellent app. A must use when visiting a city that you don't know. Great descriptions of attractions and sites to visit. I love that it breaks out places to visit in itineraries. I highly recommend using it. | Super useful | A Nice idea: needs work especially coding? app struggles, however its a nice effort with potential. Would like to edit wishlist to make notes on selections? Website doesn't let you login with G suspect more programming issues. | Amazing! | Good app with lots of fun stuff to explore. Lovely to just browse info about different cities | Fantastic app for making city visiting plans. You can make your planning consistently, based on abundante information from the app itself, and then use it later in a real life travel situation. | perfect app","{""1"":373,""2"":149,""3"":448,""4"":1720,""5"":14942}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$4.99 - $49.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Visit A City","Visit+A+City","team@visitacity.com","http://www.visitacity.com",,"https://www.visitacity.com/privacy","Visit+A+City","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2RPjnl2F36udTYWeutrdLcu67q8_OjyC4akOyHaN2RVrY2dY2L_gtt04EPP7UL9Npw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vtnEcCq94fAWcilxpK0K5ZADfDqJn7OGC_egYCh_5lT9pJb7x2bViFY9kdT8J-DXjE9m","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D2_XgwZ1SQkYV6Xq3Fm3gxcwF87A2N8z9dOdQtOG6SGEU2pkMksKBBt5QydcF2KRUz0v"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2SENJd17-wP8uZPVhg7eEpLr-4gBct3zFJmzAi-h2mk25lSEWKCowjbS5zvEwfFXkQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a0x2IJJbqjqGuAVFJL8sIqKHhjHMO4Xn6og_GxS5Yp0wEK6VShpwoa1tbdBHt1RZuNQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PhyVZRZI-4yBnVVU2-L1Ql8CI9qeAdimYek9WKDbNrSmv7vcshiUn8ijVtfSoxfDrxU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L9ZEr3UsxS-cDPdHAp4hy3a51y2YjIw9XRlZJIrKFZ8_e0spYDYPEylDA8AprTX6XW8q""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Apr 23, 2015",1705430569000,"4.1.59","Visit A City, the ultimate travel companion, just got even better!

Our original room on 3rd floor had a view of hwy and was noisy. The hotel staff moved us to a quiet room with a nice view on top floor. Both rooms were very nice and spacious. The hotel staff is very nice, professional, and accommodating. The area around the hotel is quiet at night, but lively area is only a 10 minute walk away. Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again. | The app was once wonderful, but has turned pathetic since few months.

To call this app Garbage would be insulting to garbage. Why the heck can't you fix the app? It's a massive pain to have to jump through all the hoops to sign in. I hope they start firing all your programmers | super helpful | App works well, isn't glitchy, does what it is supposed to do. | Can't wait to go | This is an easy way to get hotels.

Great Discounts | Limited hotels and their system for rewards sucks. 2 times ive lost stamps for my bookings because they claim that i wasnt logged in, but the trips are actually on my app and account. Im cancelling this app. They are not the best in prices either. | Easy to search and book hotels. The rewards program is wonderful as well (OneKey). | very convenient to see all our trip in one sight. very nice to go to each and check out about the area etc. | Easy to use, appreciate the service. | Love | Awesome Always!!! | Very easy | It was I booked free cancellation,but they are charging £70 ,it's liar about free cancellation, don't use this app anymore , don't trust with this app,and robots answer 😡 | I book 90+ hotels a year. New one key rewards are awful, and where I used to get a free night after 10 stays, it now will take around 30 nights for a free stay. Had to change to another app. If you went back to your old rewards program I would return. | Excellent service, convenient to use, quality and value | easy and quick | love all the deals, ive never had any issues when booking , and stay. | Log in won't work.

That means that you can't trust app at all. | affordable price | I want to book a hotel not spend 10 mins playing stupid games | good reliable site that appreciates it's customers. | easy booking | easy to use | The app sucks.

And causes many issues for people trying to organize a trip. | I didn't download this app | great | easy to read and accurate with the correct details | Love the ease of using this app. It's making the 'renting of hotels' process more streamlined. | easy to use, point system is good, pay when you get there is nice | Great | This site is so easy to navigate and to book reservations!

I love the rewards program. The app is very easy to use. | Always easy to get a place to stay at a decent price. | Many glitches.

I am unable to access my trips. | lots of options!! | Easy to book, a variety of options, and mixed reviews. Very hit and miss at times. The customer service is horrible, they have chat services from 3rd world counties to save a buck. Good luck getting customer service from a real agent or someone from the US. | That's its a good ideal I'm looking into it | its a good app | Great for searches, private owner rentals & member discounts are okay. Technical errors advancing to next screen for rental car payment information. | I had to cancel my account after 35+ year's. May it be AI or any other reasons but since last year the company no longer credits the reward automatically to your account. Watch out and be careful, don't believe all you read. | I am going to see your house for me today togetherness I have survived everything these bastard are welcome back home today togetherness and I'm going back to my account now I am just checking on Monday and tomorrow morning to you sir thank God bless God and bless you for rent near the airport and my mom is still waiting to see you later today and you are always happy to see your family in Jesus Will | Great app. Use it everytime. | pathetic slow app | Worst experience, sometimes we make a wrong booking, but this business will worsen your holiday because they will not cancel in time and pay you 25% more for simple mistake...please stay away from this.... | Great options to choose from and easy to use. | Nice app. easy to use and you can be confident in best rates. | I like the variety of hotel choices and reasonable discounts | very useful and easy to navigate | Just Awesome 💯 | Great prices, no problem with checking in | I am unable to fix a mistake on my email. The app says to get a code from the email ...but I can't because the email is off by one digit...and they cannot help at all. The customer service said I would have to wait until all my bookings are finished and then make a new account....thus losing any key or points etc I have earned. Ridiculous. All places have ways of fixing emails and profiles. The was great before...it is awful now. | so far this is amazing | Great deals on all kinds of hotels. Used every day on 10-day trip from Boston to West Coast. Earn points to get extra discounts. | Always there when i need them and very convenient! | I had a fraudulent charge from this company. A Google search shows that it's widespread. They need to improve their security and store less sensitive data. | Easy to use! | The options and prices are fabulous 🤩 | It's so hard to contact you | lots of hotel options, easy booking | Stupid app keeps sending me to log in screen when I request password reset Dopes | Good deals, no issues. | Up until now was a good experience. Then I accidentally cancelled a booking and they wouldn't refund or rebook the room I needed it and paid for the same room twice now I'm thinking about looking for a lawyer because it's not the amount it's the principal of it. | the platform is easily navigated . able to switch travel sites effortlessly. I continue to enjoy the proces since at the moment me with my little family of three waiting on. pottential lodging for permanent residency | I really enjoy using this app for hotel booking. I will definitely recommend this to family and friends. | easy to use | was a nice room bed was tall n comfotable. just wish we couldve gotten a room accessable room. if i go back that way ill stay again | lovely hotel, revamped there rooms, meals were good, our 2 waitresses Makutu and Nkotabonga excellent. keep it up makutu | Cannot sign in. The buttons don't work in the app | I booked cheap at a cleN morel. App was easy to use. | love the deals and options this site offers. | Terrible service. | love | Since they've changed the rewards program, there is no incentive to use this site at all. You CAN'T use the awards as you should (lots of restrictions and zero availability, etc) so, I went from using it and booking a LOT of hotel nights per year (at least 30 stays a year) to almost none... Its been I think over a year since they've changed this and I still have not been able to use the hundreds of dollars in rewards that I had accumulated. normally, I would have used them within a few weeks. | Very easy to use and accurate. Great prices | the best insight | rubbish website always glitchy | get the best deals always | Not working well | I can't sign into my account on the app | Made one booking but can't access it. Every time I try I get a message that something has gone wrong on their end. | Love the way of use, decent prices, and options. | very easy to browse. | Horrible experience with this company. I would give it a zero stars if I could. Booked way in advance, but they couldn't make changes to the reservation without canceling and booking a new one. Of course I couldn't get that accommodation or rate. Far better off to call the hotel with their offered rate. The hotel will usually reserve you at that rate as they are happy not to have to pay the 3rd party. This ""app"" made my travels far more difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson. Never again. | it was so easy to get everything I need | wish we earn better key cash and be able to use if we pay with PayPal. | Used to be great. These days just gives error messages. Or worse, let's you book and spend money, then stops letting you manage your booking. | La compra se puso a 36 coutas sin far opcion a elegir | This app constantly gives me error notifications when I try to view bookings | Great service but Crashes a lot..it's become worse for last few weeks. | great | a lot of options ,rewards | always got what was promised | super unstable app | Great app | booked a room that doesn't even take online bookings. Haven't seen the money hit my account yet and that was 3 weeks ago | It has a fundamental booking flaw | my go to app for booking hotels | I really like the option to compare and that it's the Best price | love this app | I love the easy booking and savings | I can't look at my bookings data. I keep getting: ""Sorry, something went wrong on our end"" Has been like this for days and my trip is coming up soon. Edit: I tried updating the country but issue is still happening, already contacted support, I'll update the review if it gets fixed | Complete a mess. I used to book more than 30 nights / year on this app, but for the last two years, it has became unusable, you can't search, it's not even available in French for Switzerland. | App is ok, people who assist are useless. Issue with reward nights, took 5 contacts. They are either lazy or inept or both. Maybe with them being swallowed by the other companies. Book your motel but do not expect any assistance. | In 2016 I ADORED this app. Now, 3/18/24-I am never able to use the app now. It constantly spins, doesn't connect to internet, and if I am able to get on it's super slow. I tried the app again being hopeful, but I am seeing the same issues from 2021 and 2022. Also I would love if the deposits required at the hotel were included or noted somewhere so we as customers are prepared. I've gotten into the habit of calling ahead now. | great! | Love it more than green tea | never ever works when you need it. Constantly signs you out, and when you try to sign back in, the login button simply doesn't work. Nowadays, can't even sign in at all.

Ended up having to purchase two more tickets so we could enjoy our day. I thought all tickets would be on the app but basically it's just a calendar reminder and not much use to me. | So easy to book and use | Awesome | Get your guides have great tours when you are going to cities you never been | Great tours and activities.Malta or Paris | very convenient, easy to use! Best travel experiences app | I was unable to make a payment through debit card so I did with Google pay at last | Great app! Great tours and tour guides!

I called them and they told me that the meeting point was changed. We went there and they did not wait for us. They just send an email with our cancellation without explanation. They lied to me with the cancellation reason of overbooking. Unbelievable, unprofessional and rude. I feel disappointed with your app and the company which organised this trip. 0 stars. | Fab! | Lots of choice easy website to navigate | With the best tour options and easy to sue service, you'll be sure to have the best trip! Thanks for an amazing Seoul and Busan experience ! | Easy fast secured | Booked 3 tours to Vatican & each canceled. Last one canceled bc they said GetYourGuide overbooked. Contacted customer service & they weren't able to find anything else to replace at time needed. I asked if discount can be provided on any of the upcoming 3 tours. They said discounts are for new customers only, they don't have anything for existing/loyal customers. I've gone on 4 tours in the last few days & it means nothing. Won't be using again. | The app is not needed to attend your tour despite the badly worded email. Just take your printed ticket.

I would highly recommend. | I don't even want to give this a 1 star. I used this app for a dinner cruise for me and my daughter in Czeck Republic and it was the worst experience of my life. I left an hour early from the hotel for a15 min drive to the boat but got lost and arrived just as the boat pulled away from the dock. I asked for a refund and was denied. So don't waste your time with this app/boat company. They're not understand and the ticket last was rude. They are the worst with foreigners. Will never go back. | A very pleasant day with guide Takanari. Very informative and enjoyable. Taka is very knowledgeable and proud of his heritage. I strongly recommend him to ALL toursits wishing to know more about this beautiful and exciting city. I wish many success for all the guides in this app and I admire their positivity and professionalism. Keep it up! | Easy to book | Great tours | Good | Very good | Wherever I travel if I want to do some activities I always use this app. Always everything is simply perfect. Last year in Dubai I booked like 6 activities for 2 pax using the app. I had to reschedule only one due to unexpected health issues and I was brought to a hospital. And we did our activity the next day. love the app and the people behind it. Big thanks 😊 🙏 😘 | Thank you! | I used while in Europe and the bus tour was excellent. | Easy to use and quick response | Promptly | Easy checkout. Prices are lower than on viator | Very reliable guide service, gave us a private tour of Pompeii as we were only 3 that booked. | Many interesting and scam free guides, providing opportunities for many tourists to utilise this app and see what various countries hold to offer! | Booked for tours in Berlin,Malta, Gdansk. So far very pleased. | Excellent services. | Great :) | Made things easier for sure | Very easy to use. Show great options to take in activities and surroundings site tours. | Professional communication & good instruction | So far so good with bookings | Good | Amazing experience with the most knowledgeable tour guide Andy | We booked to see The Barber of Seville opera in a Venetian palazzo and had an incredible evening | I love all the options and ease of scheduling/ booking | Such a great app,easy to use | Easy to use & book tours | Very useful source for a lot of travel requirements | Very convenient app | Me and my partner went today for an excursion with Mohamed Baakena. Everything was perfect he proper took care of us and we had a beautiful evening. Sometimes, here we had find difficult to organise with timing and understanding the schedule, this was the only website that everything was explained and with time, we also find this very helpful. Thanks again Mohamed to share a bit of Marrakesh with us it was much appreciated. Anna & Chris | Used it just a couple of times, but so far working very well. | Really easy to use with every activity in one place | Great activities all over the globe | We have booked Airport transfers and 2 trips using this app. | Awesome | Simple and straightforward. | Very useful app, always helping. | Easy to access different experiences and book them | Very good app and very good offers | Great app | Amazingly good, cheap tours. We found this while we were in Colombia, booked all our tours through Get your guide. Very satisfied, would definitely recommend | Very handy for booking activities | My sister recommended this to me. Had good deals than Agoda. | Amazing and I couldn't ask for more during my international travel. | Usability before average. Changing from dollar to euro: error. Changing date of birth: the input box does not work. Changing from filter to lists and back and your filter had been reset. Saving filters not possible. Adding a keyword to your filter: not possible. Not able to select some very important highlights. In a favorite list, open an activity, press back: you are not in your list anymore. | Very convenient and thanks to the public reviews the tours are always good quality. | Very good | Easy to navigate | The best website for a guide | Easy to use | Cheap prices and can reserve and pay closer the time 👍 | We used app for our trip to St. Augustine. Absolutely loved it. User friendly and loads of info and activities. Would recommend to anyone. | Every possible tour imaginable. | Easy !!! | Easy to use | Easy of use and user friendly. | Very easy to navigate and use | This app has made it so easy to book tours in other countries where they primarily speak different languages that I do. You can also search based on a guide that speaks your language. | Great app and easy to use | Easy to use , great options ! | Very convenient and often gives 24 hour cancellation flexibility, one does not get with buying tickets directly. | Easy to use. Very user friendly. | Good experience | Its pretty bad and cheap move that we need to install a 35mb app to get the QR code(lesser than a kb)after the booking. Email sent load of information but the simple QR code. Pure waste!!! | Great app, easy to plan different activities. | I love GET your Guide!, I have used it since it first came out, and have booked countless activities from Mont St Michelle to Pompeii to Windsor Castle, abd the Eiffel Tower. Multiple times. I want my bookings to stay in my profile, so I can use the tour I liked again. When we upgrade app, they seem to disappear. This would make it better. Thanks! | Get your gide ❤️ thank you for making our turkey holidays awesome ❤️❤️❤️ & please guys always do with Get your gide Thanks and regards Renjith &uma | Loved it. | Used this bags of times, fabulous. | App is good functionality works fine. But whatever trip or activity provider some are not good. | Useless app more then expensive i didn't have good experience you can buy tickets there 1-2 hours before less cost | Impossible to get the tickets without installing the mobile app. | Easy, functional, suppose it's alright. | Good | GetYourGuide is amazing - I have enjoyed excellent excursions using the App. | So far, I have enjoyed everything that GYG has to offer, and it has been really fun and informative . | Easy to use, brilliant user interface | Always a great service. I have used this app all over the world & have never been disappointed. The descriptions are always accurate. I just booked a helicopter over the Las Vegas strip. | Really great value tours and very knowledgable guides | Absolutely bombarded by pop ups and advertising the moment I signed up. | Easy to use and very detailed information. Highly recommended | BEWARE! This is the worst app and very false advertising when it comes to its 24 hour cancellation policy. If I could give negative stars, I would. I purchased 2 tickets today for an aquarium and within 1 hour I tried cancelling but they said my 24 hour period ended yesterday, when I didn't even have tickets! Not only this app but the place lead you in false advertising. I wouldn't use this app again even if it is the only way to purchase tickets. SUCKS! | I've used get your guide in multiple situations on multiple continents. You can find a lot of really great deals and I'm not really had any problems. | Horrible HORRIBLE PLEASE DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THEM, NOTHING THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY NEVER PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR TICKETS AND THEN 14 DAYS TO REFUND YOUR MONEY AND IF YOU LIKE ME SPEND OVER 180 DOLLARS IN TICKETS YOU WIll be missing out on that money. | Very helpful and trustable | Booked hop on bus and river cruise in Prague. Excellent value | All good | Great adventure great prices if you need a clue or to save on your trip get your guide | So convenient to have my trips in one app. | Great service iv had trips in Dubai and Thailand and everyone has gone perfect | Quick and easy booking | A very unsatisfactory service provider i asked to cancel the reservation, cuase of my mother's illness, they asked to provide the medical certificate. Dont recommend to any one | What's this all about | NEVER use this app and use their service! We joined the tour under this app as it was recommended by Google. As I needed to use my wife's iphone to connect to the car, I needed to type in the Meeting Point Address instead of pushing the Show Direction Button below. The Meeting Point Address is wrong! We ended up in a remote village through a dangerous road. The worst thing is that GetYourGuide blamed us for notshowing up at meeting point while it is obviously their problem. No APOLOGY! | Easy to use | Experiences booked with Get Your Guide have always been great. We have never had a problem, and we have used them about a dozen times. The app is also very easy to use. | If in Rome buy direct from tourist attraction. I bought a tour on number 10 bus,l from GYG and it took me over 2 hours to get it validated.... Absolute nightmare, definitely buy direct and you can't go wrong. | Excellent App | Very helpful can book all in one place love it | Good it is | Fantastic app , works really well , can't fault it , well done 👏 👍 😀","{""1"":10245,""2"":851,""3"":1460,""4"":5609,""5"":90419}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","GetYourGuide","GetYourGuide","apps@getyourguide.com","http://www.getyourguide.com","GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH

Contacted customer service & they weren't able to find anything else to replace at time needed. I asked if discount can be provided on any of the upcoming 3 tours. They said discounts are for new customers only, they don't have anything for existing/loyal customers. I've gone on 4 tours in the last few days & it means nothing. Won't be using again."",""I've used this app for several trips now. Had some excellent tours, and a few marginal ones. But my biggest issue is from our recent trip to Spain. I had booked a number of tours in 3 cities. All were booked in March for the Oct trip. And even though my credit card was the same as when booked, their system decided I was a risk because of booking too many activities. It didn't decide this until it was time for activites. As a result, we missed two planned activities."",""My experience was very bad. The booking went smooth, but I booked 2 events and I did need to cancel one of them. From the application I tried to cancel the booking and got a message saying something went wrong and then contacted the support who took very long time then said they can't refund and cancel. I wouldn't recommend this app or their system."",""Avoid GetYourGuide! Double-charged due to app glitch when booking. Spent three frustrating hours trying to get a refund, customer service refused. Two bookings missing initially, so I rebooked. Days after contacting them it was added to my profile (scammy), but no refund issued despite obvious proof. Screenshots are crucial of EVERY step of the booking process! Customer service may request more details here, but it is a deceptive tactic to give YOU a false sense of security that they care.""]",false,false,false,"com.getyourguide.android","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getyourguide.android&hl=en&gl=us"

Is good. Like it! | no chat option | Unsupportive customer support that just ignores you | Klook is a cheat app. They will take your money and when you try to reserve a slot you find tickets are not available for the date you choose. Worst they will not refund your money even if you are departing the place and tickets are not available before your departure date. Customer service is terrible. | cheaper than others app | Excellent Service! | excellent app for travelers!!!! | Great app, easy to use | Easy to use and the discount is veey useful | Online booking was easy with instant confirmation | awesome app! | very convenient to pay. | Bad | very convenient | I've been using this app for a year and I only review it now.

Bad app. Inflexible compared to direct website. | My go to app when traveling...one stop shopping. Plus it's user friendly | Useful and safe app to use! | non-existent help desk, continues to allow booking to take place when vendor's reservation is full. glad that you asked: the booking confirmation is YJG168714. i provided an email screenshot of reply from the vendor that my reservation is full and will be cancelled. in spite of that, i was asked to wait for another 3 days thru the help desk that 'i have to wait 3 more days ' for response from vendor. what in the world. and as of now, the 'full booking' date is still available for booking | Bought 2 tickets for Osaka Amazing pass intended for my mom and sister for their Japan Holiday but I forgot to put in their names instead of mine while making the booking. Only after payment did I see the policy that the passport of person's name in the booking is needed to claim the tickets. Since I won't be going with them, they won't be able to claim it because original passport is needed. I reached out to customer service to ask how I can change the names but did not get any help from them | Haven't have any problem redeeming the tickets. Used the app for different places in different countries. | ONE OF THE WORSE BOOKING APP EVER! They won't help you change dates or amend bookings done a few minutes ago, what a load of BS.

Able to purchase tickets in my home country currency (Canada) and at better prices and rates direct from Universal Studios Hollywood and Disneyland California.

The headling of their services can be some how confusing. | very good | Very easy to search and purchase tickets for interesting places to go. | always use Klook for advance tickets. | Booked ferry tickets in Vietnam via the app two days before the departure. I never received the boarding tickets. After repeatedly urging, they just cancelled my booking ten hours before the departure. Didn't get any notification, nothing - just couldn't find my booking anymore. Now I'm stuck at the port and can't leave, because all the other ferries on the route sold out meanwhile. The money have not been refunded yet. Would never book again over this app, and wouldn't recommend to anyone. | fast transaction | is easy to use and very helpful | I did not know Klook but thought I would give it a try. Fantastic service. will definitely use Klook more often! | lots of deal options and easy to use. | Good travel application. | It was difficult at first then after.. Everything goes smoothly...

My halong bay cruise booking got cancelled even after full payment with reason as out of stock. although it shows availability again on the same days. Didn't expect this from klook. If its out of stock what's the point in availability, ridiculous. What's more funny is sill the same cruise shows availability on the day our tickets got cancelled with reason saying out of stock. I didn't received my refund yet. | Useful and helpful especially for those travelling on a budget | it is cheaper and very convenient | awesome app | Got ticket for Osaka tickets while there without wait on line | no easy access to a person !! | great | order with klook breaks the language barrier and avoid local scam. definite tour description and delivered as it is. | Great app to help get around Japan | An app that has made my travel arrangements so much more comfortable.

Stated 48hr for the confirmation, now 1 week pass still not yet get the reply. And already charge me on full amount. Scam! | very convenient and easy to book. make my trip happy and relax. | Klook is a great middle person for travellers and attractions. It helps to streamline everything into 1 common app. Now, sometimes it is better to just buy it from the attraction's official site itself but majority of times, it's actually cheaper here. In terms of user experience, it's easy to use so far. Never had to cancel any booking myself so I can't comment on those experience. And I hope I don't need to. | Clean room | great! | This app is very easy to use!!! excellent job! | Please adjust the screen to fit honor pad x9. | confuse to use code. | quick booking... excited for our first flight as a family | It's great to know this app that has many discounts.

Always find the best deals when booking airfare and hotel together. Love Travelocity!!!! | thank you for the fair price on a one way ticket 🥰 | fantastic | always getting locked out | I use Travelocity all the time. Easy to use and quite often cheaper prices than the hotel site. | fake prices, as soon as you pick return flight, price doubled. Better off using airline app | Perfect! | very easy site to use. | easy to book everything for your trip. | good prices | Best travel app for sure!!! I've been using this app for over 10 years | better than Priceline! | so far so good | easy to use | kindness goes a long way | great to work with. | I downloaded the app and went to sign in but when I type the first letter the keyboard disappears and I can't log in. | Travelocity's support representatives have always given me very good support. Recently the representative contacted the hotel and was able to get me a cancelation and refund on a non-refundable hotel reservation. | it would not let me log in | Tried to use my flight credit. It wasn't worth the hassle!! I am done with Travelocity!! | easy to use | won't allow me to sign in | Garbage, half works, customer service is a joke, can't update passport information, it's not a good app at all! | i need to change a booking My itinerary number is not recognised, so I am not able to speak to an agent. travelocity say the airline can make the change. the airline says travelocith has to change the booking. I have been going back and forth for over an hour. I am outraged. | I can't log in | love the site | Poor customer services held my refund for 7 to 10 days and couldn't accommodate my stay for myself and children. I greatly do not recommend. | always find what I am looking for with Travelocity. | Hard to use | You can't sign into the app. My keyboard disappears after I type in the first letter. So if you can't sign in the what's the point of the app? | Do not use Travelocity! The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I thought I had booked a room for one night on the same day. I got to the Motel and it had booked me on another day that the app chose for the best price! The clerk spent like 40 minutes speaking to Travelocity. So I decided to go through my app and got everything straight or so I thought.. finally the clerk said it will still be a while. I had enough. I had to be somewhere in a hour. Tried to get a refund and they refused. No humanity at all! | The gentleman at check in was very nice, friendly and professional. Unfortunately, while the room was very clean, it was also very austere. no attempt at any ambiance. No closet, only one night stand, and absolutely nothing on the walls. Also, a one inch gap at the bottom of the entry door which allowed a cold draft until we stuck a towel along the gap. Will not stay there again. | great | Very Good experience and always the best offers and prices. | What's New in each version of your app?.......? The generic, unchanged text is useless. | Great App | They are the best ever overall travel company | I think they can get you good prices in places you want to be | Great App! Makes it super easy to plan a trip | excellent app for look a airplane tickets | user friendly | Stuck forever on searching for return flight | I've saved so much money with Travelocity. I've planned 2 package trips to Vegas with them. flight for 2 and hotel both times and have had 0 issues. got the top floor at the strat for an absolute steal. | Travel is freedom! | Quick and easy to navigate | Good app | AWESOME SERVICE. HAD ISSUES WITH A HOTEL BOOKED THRU TRAVELOCITY. AFTER TRYING TO TALK TO HOTEL DIRECTLY TO DEAL WITH ISSUES WITH NO RESOLVE, WE DECIDED TO TALK TO TRAVELOCITY. THEY DEALT WITH THE HOTEL THEMSELVES AND REASSURED US THAT EVEN IF THE HOTEL WAS NOT REFUNDING MONEY, THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE THEY EXPECT MORE HIGHER STANDARDS OUT OF HOTELS THEY BOOK FOR. WE WERE SO SATISFIED, WORDS JUST CANNOT EXPRESS HOW FOND WE ARE OF THE SERVICE. | I've used Travelocity for 20years, I get the best rates, and they have the top of the line staff to assist you. I highly recommend Travelocity! | The bundle option is great. Searching low to high listing first some times sucks because they aren't always lowest isn't always first.resorts and hotels must be paying to get on the list higher up | It is pretty run down and costs a lot. Half of the light bulbs were not working, paint was chipped off the walls, and the door lock was broken. It didn't feel clean or that safe. Not a good deal. I would recommend finding a different hotel | Do not book with Travelocity. If there is an issue with the airline, it's a nightmare trying to get anything done with these guys. | thanks Travelocity 💕 | it was easy. a great hotel. | so far so good. it's been useful to find travel needs last min. fairly good prices usually. especially if you dig a bit. | smooth as always!! | nice work | Hacked | i spent all dsy trying to book a flight, no luck | good app | I like the business, and customer support people are nice. But app & site doesn't recognize my yahoo email that I used, and now I can't keep track if anything changes. No one from customer support has been able to help with this so far. | Always easy to use app! Good info and choices offered for my travel needs. | excelent facilities. clean and friendly people. | can't log in | So far my booking is going as planned with no issues ! | I love Travelocity for travel advice and looking up flights. I no longer book my flights on any discount service after United changed my flight times 4 times before a trip. I'll look up flight options and times, then book my flight directly with the airline that is my choice found on Travelocity. otherwise, it's a great app. | This travel app has gone down the tubes. They're playing games with the prices. If you don't book the first flight you check, when you go back to it again the price has gone up! They don't show you all the flights either. I'm done with it after all these years. You're better off going directly to the airlines website. | Love will use this again | Works okay mostly on my phone for the wife to use | great website to book any hotels or flights | It is useless. i created an account solely to have the ability to check and assure safe flights of family members, and this app or website can not even deliver that. How does one manage to check one's own flight under these circumstances. Booooo👎👎👎 | Exelente via de encontrar lo necesario | trying to login with my email and it will not let me type my email address | It's almost impossible to navigate or go back one screen. | easy to use & helpful agents if you run into any issues | They have been great with all my travels | couldn't get my eticket. not users' friendly | iwantagreatdeal,donewithgreatskill .whodoicall? | This app sucks. I just created a profile, and I know what password and email I used, but it does not recognize it. I also made a reservation, and it can't find my reservation even after giving the reservation number that was given to me | I always use Travelocity, they do a great job, and if there's anything wrong they are quick to make it right. | great comparison | have been a Travelocity for years. never have i had a problem gracias | Very hard to get around the site. I wouldn't waste my time downloading this one folks. I spent hours trying to book a simple flight That Travelocity kept putting whatever they wanted in my choices and half of the things you click on do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Try putting your area code in. I couldn't I just type it in with my number.????? I ended up calling united airlines and they gave me a better deal than Travelocity. | Booked a flight and paid for seat selection but was not given a way to pick our seats. Went through HELL with the airline to get 2 seats together. If your site is going to offer seat selection at an increased price then it should allow us to pick our seats while on your site. | the app was easy to use and the member discount was a big help. | Simple and convenient | Great app and service. Thanks! | GET A TRAVEL AGENT INSTEAD. I booked a flight and hotel for my parents for their 50th anniversary. Plans change and half the money paid was not returned. Called agent to cancel and was told policy gives them permission to keep any and all charges for any flights. Any subsequent reply by travelocity will just be to excuse themselves and justify their actions. BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU ARE 1000000% SURE YOU YOURSELF ARE GOING.

It was the worst experience ever! 3 days later, the money still isn't back in my account and the rooms are sold out ! | Great prices! | good service | Despite being the little brother company of Expedia, I find the site to be better and customer service better. | Horrible app | service was exceptional | this app won't let me pick what airport I want to go to | very helpful, got discount. easy to use. | took care of me when the hotel cancelled on us just a day before our arrival, they did this at no extra cost for me, I will definitely buy my future vacation packages from Travelocity. | App took my 2 night booking request and stuck me with one night, then tried to get me to pay 3x the price, plus a series of fees to add the second night. Found the same hotel for both nights cheaper on Kayak,so I got swindled by the gnome | easy to use | I'll never use them again. App doesn't work, no record of my booking. Had to contact airline directly in the end.

Used it for years now, fully recommended! | great price , quick | This is the easiest way to make travel plans! | sucks | I have received the best car rental prices through this site. On the return of my rental vehicles I've seen people pay 2 or 3x as much as what I pay for half the time. I highly recommend Travelocity. | pain to navigate. need my flight numbers, not your numbers | why is the default date 2 weeks away, it should default to today. now I have no reservation. | bad seic | quick and easy!! | Great deals | I had the worst experience. They didn't refund my money after I had cancelled my hotel booking even after the hotel didn't deduct any money. I was booked onto a flight I didn't know I needed a visa for at one of the layovers and they still didn't refund my money. They don't even deserve a star. The agents are very helpful and quick to help in the beginning but as soon as payments are made and the client needs help. All of a sudden they can only do texts yet the would call previously | EXCELLENT VERY GOOD APP | Requires sign in, but doesn't allow access to the keyboard. If you don't want people to use your app, just take it down. Don't make it unusable. | pretty simple to use | Sucks | nice people clean rooms | Can't pay online or nothing | Garbage | Unable to enter password enter 1 letter and the dropbox goes away and can't enter anymore. It doesn't show my bookings very poor. | Absolutely useless, can't find my itinerary | I count on Travelocity to get the best deals and I know that the team is there to assist when there's a bump in the road. thanks again Travelocity | Simply the best...I have been booking all of my travel through them for several years. and it has always been awesome.... | Travelocity's website said hours of operation of Thrifty were 24 hours a day at TPA, flew in late at 2:30am to find they're closed. Had to sit in the terminal until 6am when they opened back up. Horrible experience. Very unhappy. | Horrible experience! Can't log in to check into account. Paid for tickets . App cut out charged twice. No customer service to fix. | This app sucks. Try searching for a hotel and add filters. It just resets everything and asks you the same questions over and over. It's maddening. Contact customer service and their response is ""use your pc"" so the app is basically worthless if you want to use filters for your search. Feels broken and as if the intent is to deter people from using it. | convenient and easy | Great | Since update. Won't allow me to sign in. Can log onto web, but not app.😔 | Seems well organized and I can usually find what I'm looking for about my trip info when I need it. | Not always best price. | EZ to install, navigate and book😊 | offers so many options in one placr | one of the earliest travel agency online | while booking a hotel room for the night the app skipped ahead and changed the date for the booking for several weeks in the future. I didn't notice and got stuck with a useless room booked without a chance of refund! when I tried to call Travelocity from the number I was told it was an non working number. | New to app but seems like great deals! | Travelocity has always been great for me for all the vacations I have taken as well as simple getaways. | good functionality smooth interface | Want let me sign | Can't get real time customer support | Love the ease of use. My go-to for travel. | Unable to see my booked flight | Horrible interface with android phones. When I attempt to sign in, after typing email address it brings you to the password box. Upon typing any letter in the password box, the keyboard disappears. Been doing this no matter if I power down and restart phone. Samsung galaxy fold 5. | Won't let me type to sign in | to long | one sorry app it needs to be discontinued and removed from google play | Love travelocity | Bad experince in Costa Rica w Hotel reservation | Love this App. Very easy to use and filter by location and price. I also like to send reviews of the different places I stayed. So many other reviews helped me choose or avoid places. It's great to work together | Complete waste of time horrible company | For months, the app will not allow me to type a password or use the Facebook sign in to access the account. The password only ballots one letter before the keyboard collapses and the Facebook login has an error message that the app is not working and the app developer is aware of the situation.

The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I thought I had booked a room for one night on the same day. I got to the Motel and it had booked me on another day that the app chose for the best price! The clerk spent like 40 minutes speaking to Travelocity. So I decided to go through my app and got everything straight or so I thought.. finally the clerk said it will still be a while. I had enough. I had to be somewhere in a hour. Tried to get a refund and they refused. No humanity at all!"",""The gentleman at check in was very nice, friendly and professional. Unfortunately, while the room was very clean, it was also very austere. no attempt at any ambiance. No closet, only one night stand, and absolutely nothing on the walls. Also, a one inch gap at the bottom of the entry door which allowed a cold draft until we stuck a towel along the gap. Will not stay there again."",""Date auto reset placing the reservation on the wrong date... they corrected the issue... then the reservation I made got canceled without any notification because the hotel was overbooked... they worked furiously for a half hour to find a room, but there is no availability, so they sent me an email to send a receipt when I found a room. So they charged me with no place to sleep on vacation. Thank you travelocity... you suck!! Perhaps only the first part was the apps fault, but..."",""I used Travelocity all the time, but the app will not let me sign in. Every time I try to put my credentials in, it lets me put the first letter in and then nothing else after. I have deleted the app and re downloaded it several times with the same issues. This has been going on since June because I had another trip then and I had the same issue."",""The customer service is terrible even if you give them a lot of business like me they will not care. Note: even if you pay the insurance $9.00 you can not change reservations BE AEARE. The app is a scam because they let that option be enabled in some non refundable cases. Cherry on the top: you'll get zero points for traveling, also ZERO benefits for long time customers.

The most jarring being arriving at the train station and seeing the train had been canceled. Trip didn't notify me of this, and didn't refund their booking fee, as, \""the tickets had been issued successfully.\"" It's ridiculous to pay a fee for a service that wasn't fruitful. Had to change to a flight, and pay two taxi fees. Needless to say I booked the alternative flight via a different app."",""BAIT AND SWITCH Disappointed. App shows a tremendous deal on an upcoming flight that I want to book. Via the airline's website, the cost is about $900. Trip's cost was closer to $500. Same flights/same days. Great deal, right!? As I'm trying to book it, a pop-up message appears \""Sorry. This flight just sold out.\"" Attempted to book another flight to a different location... EXACTLY the same pop-up. Bait and switch. Sketchy. Do not recommend!"",""Kind of misleading. Started with a web search showing a room available, but needed an account to access the deal. I downloaded the app, only to find the room was \""sold out\"". I doubt it was ever available in the first place. Also the app spams me with notifications. Even worse, there's a 7 day waiting period to delete my account (linked to Google)."",""Imo, the main metrics of quality of a travel app are cost and the simplicity of getting returns. The cost differs on destinations, so I won't say much. The return policy is weird. They are honest when you did everything right, but the interface is so ambiguous that you are likely to commit some error while attempting to. And then they'll blame their app's fault on you and not fix the issue. I lost 660 USD this way."",""I have almost never left a review comment but that absolutely terrible experience needs to be recorded. I purchased a roundtrip ticket via Trip, was only issued the return ticket and the initial leg of the trip was cancelled. How does a company only issue one part of the tricket? As it took me days to find this out (I had to contact them) I needed to cancel my whole trip as there are now no other flights available. They also will not refund the return leg.

Thanks | very good service | Good | not as cheap as advertised | v good | Excellent easy to book and used friendly | best | I'm lovin' it. I only use Agoda. | easy to booking | it has great deals | very expensive | Very disappointed! There is no OTP Code confirmation for debit card payments, this is very detrimental for a non-refundable policy. It would be better if everything that has been canceled can be refunded. | ok | this third party app is really good | good | over complicated booking | Work better now. Need to allow for booking multiple room types in one transaction. | call miltiple times customer service Jakarta no response. booking primary suite room in best wester panbil batam but they give executive room, thry said is agoda wrong input.. cant contact agoda in any number!!!! | not good service | Best prices | great deals..loving it. | WE HAD A SNAKE IN OUR TOILET, TERRIBLE STAY. Our stay at the relax resort in Koh Phangan was over expensive and terrible. The room didn’t the look like a superior bungalow at all, moreover we had trouble with shower. The shower was not working in toilet, due to which we got late to our planned destinations. We also saw there was a snake in our toilet which caused huge panic and stress. Agoda Customer care were useless in anyway to help us get the refund or help in anyways. There are better apps. | Good app good price | nice | the app is very easy to use | good platform hotel booking | I had worst experience today with Agoda. I booked a specific room with a nice view, but on reaching the hotel, staff said they uploaded a photo of a superior room by mistake, and so now I'm staying at the basic room, which I had never booked. The staff offered to adjust the payment, which is fine, but the experience I wanted is ruined. Very disappointed with this so called 'mistake'. We drove 6 hours to Panchgani to get this experience. | better deals than the website | I really don't know who's rating this application 5,4 or even 2, worst application I have ever used never gonna come back this platform wnna mark this app flag but | ok | terrible i got scammed | The Agonda Hotel Special Rates are top notch and and are deserving to recognized as a Job Well Done. Unfortunately After that it goes downhill and off to the left so fast you'll get a nose bleed and whiplash before u say Highway Homophobia Robbery! Upon arrival I was met by a front desk clerk with no Uniform and no name tag. Several people were hanging out around the FRONT Desk pointing and snikering at partner. The person at the desk said to one of the Hangers Around that she looks like a boy. | very fast | 4 as of now.. will make it 5 star later if it is true.. This is my first time here.. 😍😍😍 | easy | ok | Clear and Easy | reliable | Good Service 👍 | Quick and easy | ok | Very bad experience I booked hotel for 29 march till 30 March the day was 29mach morning 9 pm after booking they changed the booking to 28th mach which cannot happen on making booking on 29 how can u book from 28 my money gone as they show its non refundable very bad app | I like the service, I just wish they'd get rid of all the crazy pop ups and stuff. The app is barely usable, cannot click anything before a random pop up shows. | easy to book? | terbaik... all the best | Decent prices | I've used Agoda many times and got some FANTASTIC deals! | booking was easy, discounted rate is a plus | Good job | This is my preferred booking site worldwide. | good | I would suggest not to book hotel through agoda, I had booked hotel on Agoda I received confirmation mail also, I paid 30% advance amount to property owner & at the last moment property owner contacted me saying your booking is not confirmed due to overbooking. There confirmation message has no value until you actually check in to the hotel... Don't depend on agoda they will ruine your vacation plan if you are worriless after hotel booking | very bad experience in booking | All good, just App a bit slow. | good | I booked with Agoda. When I got to check in. I found out there was additional fees not covered in the app. The hostess explained as well that Agoda doesn't display all fees associated with the hotel. I wouldn't of booked otherwise. They need to be up front about all fees. I want a refund. Update: They won't be refunding me. They blame the policy of the hotel. But the fees were not covered in my booking with Agoda. Beware! Don't use. | ok | love it with shop back cheers | Very good apps..... | Good deals | I dont get money from refund my booking, and this process is clueless | nice deals | easy to use great savings | love this Agoda.. easy to book.. multiple option to select | Very unprofessional and unpleasant experience with agoda. No quality control they just tie up with any property with validating any information. Hotel didn't have parking and expected us to park far from the hotel and come back. They expected us to shuffle the luggage standing on the road and then park the vehicle somewhere remotely. We were denied checkin to the hotel and asked to take refund, agoda didn't do anything yet we were standing on the road with kids with no support from the agoda exe | good palce | good | thank you so much for best deel | excellent | quick and easy to find a place | Filters not working and showing me sold out hotels | everything easy | excellent performance | Agoda prices are fair. The Agoda website works well. | good | excellent very good best application | super | good | good | fantastic | refund 1 bulan setelah berkali kali telepon cs. Padahal yang membatalkan pesanan sistem agoda | 1. Agoda will give 10% fake discount for rentals etc. 2. Agoda will charge you and therefore pay later at hotel check in counter and claim cash back is invalid as they scam ppl. got scammed by this method for $222. 3. save card function uncheck doesnt work. This is also a scam who knows want they do with your card later. 4.Delete account function might not work either since save card function not work. It says and log me out but it is within realm of software power and their hand. | Alrighty! | simple | Please sort out issues with recognition of UK number, took me 10 time to book room, eventualia I need to use PayPal. And will change my rating, thanks. | good | great deal | Great service. good deals! | fast | i love this app | Good app, Services. | Very very bad experience i book a hotel and pay online before 5 day my plane was change I want to cancel booking they don't refund money today date is 27-03-2024 my booking is 1 -04-2024 I will attach some photo as a proof | good | so easy great deal | 2 star due to the deceptive way Agoda hides extra fees in the fine print of their payment terms. The app says e.g. ""you saved $10!"" at checkout to make you think you got a deal, then they charge your card $20 more than the checkout price shown in the app. They count on most people not noticing. If you carefully read the payment terms and avoid their expensive fees, Agoda is a good way to book hotels. | very easy, fast, good filter | Very bad experience while logging in to account. Also not able to cancel the bookings. | confusing with offers and final payable amount | easy to book and good price | fast and amazing offer | Easy Hotel Booking | good discounts | good | easy to use and great deals | Very pathetic experiance with Agoda. They have taken payment from me but hotel is not accepting the booking. Agoda is a Fraud app. Don't use agoda. | How to change e-mail address? | โคตรเฮ็งซวย ขึ้นห้องพักให้กดจองได้แต่แอ้ปยกเลิกแล้วให้มาทำเรื่องคืนเงินโคตรเสียเวลาชิบหาย แม่งห่วยแตกๆๆๆๆ อย่าใช้แอ้ปส้น* ีนนี่ | nice | fast and cheap... thanx to Agoda | Always pop up encountered a technical issue when i try to book a hotel | Good | is very good | Sudah coba berulang kali pembayaran tiket pesawat dan selalu gagal, kenapa sih ribet banget.. Sistem transfer aja biar gampang. Tolong di perbaiki lagi dear Agoda team | easy check out process. great prices | very good experience | Good apps | fab prices! | Agoda has been good to book with | Total waste application ... Bad experience ... | great app | easy . friendly and fast | only app booking app I would ever use | beautiful app | I have used these guys before and got great rates. love them | good site booking hotels services | peace of mind, thanks agoda | Excellent | Had to give one star as there is no option for Zero star rating.Most unreliable horrible services. Rude behaviour by the hotel staff on checkin agoda does not take any action even if you call and log a complaint.All they say is they will refund the amount But to get a last minute booking I had to bear double the cost . Who will reimburse for this loss . They don't allow you to rate the hotel on their Website. I guess that is one of the reasons for higher ratings of hotels. | Easy app to book hotels at cheaper rate to higher cost. | very good | 뉴욕에서도 인터넷으로 칭찬글보고 했어요 | great offers! | difficult in using payment page | Worst. Lost my agodacash when i tried to re-book the hotel. I wanted to pay extra with agodacash but gone. Definitely scam. | excellent experience | Big job guys. Is hot same hotel was charging me $300 to stay for 7 days? How? So you'll find me found me a way better deal.I appreciate it.Thank you very much.Because right now I don't have a place to live.So I'm living in hotels and it sucks.I'll never have no money to move out.So if I think you'll appreciate it you're quick too | Very Good | very uncomfortable app it's impossible to find enough information about the places we are going to book in, for example I got big problem because it was very difficult for me to find the right address of my hotel | Updating from 5 Star to 1 Agoda(Platinum User - India) 1 : Content Error-2 hotels with different addresses were mentioned with same address and I ended up choosing the wrong one because of Agoda's mistake. 2: Hotel called to inform their pool wasn't functioning. Even worse for me. 3: Cancellation was non refundable so I am subjected to no refund (No CS team to reach out in India). 4: Property revealed that no communication came from Agoda regarding Cancellation and I am not getting any refund. | great deal | Good visualisation, best price available on every hotel choices | Worst online hotel booking app I have ever used. Worst cancellation experience.. | Worse than pathetic.... Scam I booked a room, on property it was a cramped room, with no facility TV, AC, toiletries, even attached washroom, they took extra 500 to change a room. They said we display our best room to lure the customer. In agoda app adverse review are not displayed. They don't keep it in record to mislead the future prospect. Don't go for it. | Thank you agoda for solve my problem, if you have any problems just contact them via email. | ระบบน่าจะทำรีวิวแยกตามห้องที่จองและเวลาที่เข้าพักให้อ่านง่ายขึ้นด้วย | Good Prices, great value | Best app for hotels.. super cheap too | user friendly apps | Not Useful | easy to use | good | PAYMENT IN HOTEL SO GOOD | I got worst experience after booking room through Airbnb. My booking (HMDBYERX2W) canceled without my confirmation and customer support was horrible. I will not recommend anyone to do the booking through Airbnb. | great price | good deals | very quick and convenient | Good Apps | They do not provide clear cancellation charges. In some posts, they have a free cancellation option, which you forget while browsing different hotels, and then they charge 50% of your booking fee as cancellation charges. Horrendous! Be careful. | The best booking app by far! | Very bad customer service. I tried contacting them about my booking issues but they kept telling that they're having technical difficulties. I'm very disappointed. | At first I thought this was an awesome app so I recommended it to my mom and oh man... She made a reservation for ger birthday but had to cancel. Keep in mind she is canceling MONTHS in advance. First off she went through hell trying to get a real person, then they charged her to have a real person call her back (only way to get to a real person), then the phone rang one time and hung up so she missed the call and when she tried to call back it said she had to start over. Beyond frustrating. | always cheaper compare to others platform. thanks agoda | I have been a royal member of Agoda for years. Recently, I just noticed all my records of travel stats and Amoji have been disappeared completely after updating the app. Please help me to get back all the info for personal travelling records. | very good | I loveeeeee agoda | very good | superb and hassle free booking. reasonable costs and great discounts 👍👍 | Best pricing found! Great discounts and easy to use app! | Easy to navigate, and book, at a competitive price. | Wonderful app. Great deals for travel and accommodation. | best | everything works everytime | horrible, it doesn't process payments, it crashes every 2 minutes. | nice | always the cheapest and good deals | Good service, I'm just tired of so many companies these days smothering us to death with apps... | Very Worst , Don't trust this App. Please choose some other App, After Booking you will be get fooled. | Ez to booking | easy to book very nice and useful app, thnxx Agoda | good service | I have used agoda for years, always good prices and customer service. | good | its convenient with lots of hotel choices and great deals | cheap and fast | Hopefully good starving 😀 | excellent service all the best | gud | great deal | good | Great and easy booking | nice option on agoda | Totally bad experience 👎👎👎 .

Their main issues are their map in other countries don't display the correct addresses (or are formatted incorrectly), they do not have accurate reviews due to their rating system, and their refund policy is non-existent. The app itself has real issues loading and the UX refreshing causes major headaches when attempting to load info and view chat history."",""Very disappointing service 😒 The Agoda app is great till there is something wrong with a hotel. Then you get a Indian call center that has poor audio and cannot understand your problem. I waited for 40 minutes on the phone to try to get this resolved. The reason I asked for a refund was the fact that this hotel said a benefit was parking, when we arrived at the hotel has no parking was available at the hotel.

Have all features needed. | Was OK for a while but now the app thinks I'm based in Boston, USA and flights start from there by default. No good to me as I live in the UK. | Great | good | 👍 | Couldn't figure it out I wanted to buy a flight on website | Good app | I enjoy using this platform. It gives a really good selection of fares. I don't always trust the unknown sites offers though. | good | Loooove it | Good | Options whuch are given to fly are almost not possible such as low price and flexibility. Thanks. | Provides adequate information on flight schedules / price | nice | When I'm in Finland I don't want my entire app language be set to Finnish! I want it to be English. Bad settings - I'd give it zero stars, for it's unusable and thoughtless features. | Not user friendly | fantastic 😍 | Very good data. A bit too techy on look and feel. | This is one of the worst apps I've had the displeasure of using. Constantly fails to load, always shows the wrong data, when trying to favorite a flight to track it, it either fails to favorite it or favorites a completely different one. This app has caused plenty of headaches and confusion. 10/10 would not recommend | no way to stop alerts, I had to add address to spam list | Would be great when adding a trip/flight/reservation to have an option to add to android/google calendar. | good | smart app, well designed and love the power of it. | good | good app for traveling | Great deals sometimes 😄 | super 👌 | Beware of booking tickets through these apps, the sites listed will take the money and will issue tickets after 6 hrs in some cases, App is good for price comparison. | very informative and easy to use. | a very good app for finding flights | best price and easily to find u near date flight | excellent | I like the app and use it many years. Please add connection country filter instead of connection airport, because visa regulations apply to entire country and it doesn't matter which particular airport refuse me to enter. | My go to flight app | BEWARE * RIP OFF $ * RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE & LOTS OF VOOKIES & ENDLESS COMMERCIALS! GET LOST PLEASE! | good | Great app for flights..always use this one above others | easy to use app always gives best prices | Not sure what happened to this app. Gone are the days I used to get best fares to brag. | Great 👍 | could add trends of prices | good | awesome | momondo are a very professional service provider and they will always provide for their customers | Good App | MOMONDO saves me $$$ | top search engine | Show price in Euros after change to more expensive UK pounds and cannot be changec. Tricky fellows | the best travel app out there | 💯❤️ | easy, fast, best deals. | Why did you add again when I have finished paying, developers 83€ today | the price of tickets since I downloaded the app has sky rocketed | often the prices are really wrong and when I go to book they are much higher. | momondo is amazing | nice | nice app! | Wrong recommendations to book the air ticket (eDream) website cheating and scamers dealing with momondo app as well. | Best flight app I could find, I can clearly set my unique parameters when searching for flights. Highly recommended. | very good app and thanks | nice app | Perfect application | It has saves me 10s of thousands of dollars","{""1"":1398,""2"":399,""3"":798,""4"":6006,""5"":59265}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","KAYAK.com","5306964836620635204","feedback@momondo.com","http://www.momondo.com",,"https://www.momondo.com/privacy","5306964836620635204","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Qu9lCCiLCn7dE-bKzdwbX9Onbz0KXdv636AMyPlahRIrVy5jveGrfMjsLwWk9fLLcJlR","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2E-bdhVagNmNYdaxcAJlNsCW-78XAwv_EtSwQyV-x0gyN92ep0XwmrailteVJVXGi28","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jt3Xim4Nt_YokVIl6Qg17AcYtA4c2NvCS1CvNh60-SIJwe8SYZZRzgcCtz-_hUNiAQI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wlMdPaHitvzkTelGVNENlmXr4zA3HUNRaJYyc82NyH9cOxpQsjCDtOT5bOcWGLj0oSc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8GzbWJPv8avt7ttQmbeKpkhLE-BuFCEvXcXvm9h7IkYXw3qbYaIPRnZvXEjkcLhWzw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Rp70Z3TFgC3wo0ihG4BIhjJStPH3R34vzAvgzRixQExh96DyekeTxpQGt_B0n3sGcA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Bo-AQ5AvZwUiCLx6oAYABt5UoQH0oW6FwBrblk44hxUpCW1J0L0IMNfSzGWVkXgGyhc"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AsuMfcU7OIca8NbBciUkcYn62aRiLQNKCYeJImopCLfCrjrqszmmqWF-xp2_cAYro_pk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/f7jDN1EoELyulPLhuSvZaiTvjQFEnsyqVFWPPIAHL7hGQMU5R1CWFQUGY_IKeP0Dwm0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2Nrb1UJ96aQA3WeZofR70ZCLFemDndIgmpl2NJCNXw291-I_1ETpi_7-hTUPmbIhCA""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,"Dec 9, 2011",1711534462000,"201.2","Introducing passkeys, a new way to log in securely and effortlessly.

No taxes included, and then you get slapped with a higher price than expected. Not happy at all. | great location, near Union station. most all stuff is walkable nice clean joint, big / lots of rooms. accommodating & friendly staff. | Great | Money deducted and booking done in sold out hostel and cancellation done just before arrival. Pathetic portal and service | Great place to find the perfect accommodation for your destination and needs at nice low rates. | I want to remove my pre-filled in credit card details but it is not possible, please fix this to make the app more secure | Rko | HostelWorld sells overbooked hostels that are sold out and than doesn't even respond back to return the money. The 'Booking' app has always emailed me back immediately. HostelWorld also does not care if their vendors constantly charge more for their rooms despite it being priced differently on their app. 1 star for stealing peoples money and not emailing back on MULIPLE occasions. | The idea behind the app is good, the implementation is decent. Looks like a MVP generated by a small startup, has minimal functionalities, can't put payment details from the app, no customer support, no information about payments | they don't publish honest reviews when terrible experiences are had by clients. They also don't do anything about the bad experiences and don't hold their hostels accountable. | Good 😃 | A hostelworld error caused me to lose money. The response from the customer service was as if its my fault and they made out that I should be greatful for a small amount of the money I lost, back. I responded and have not received a response back. Really bad from hostelworld, makes me not want to book through them again. I lost two nights worth of money and it ruins my travel plans as I have to stay here now because of being charged twice. Wouldn't refund 1 night to stop me being charged twice. | great way to find nice hostels in Japan. haven't tried it elsewhere yet. | Great choice | just joined. so far so good | Unable to view any previous trips, leave reviews or use the chat function. Disappointed. | great value ! nice people | Don't recommend | Very creative mind to let people socialize. very innovative thinking, should bring more similar initiatives. Good job | Easy to use | Works well. I can quickly book a night on the spot around. Great value for a backpack trip in Japan. | Nice but seems more expensive than Booking, also no fidelity program ! | No use (don't know if it's temporary issue/permanant one). App is not able to book hostels in Iran. | works fast, plenty of options. I still don't try the customer service. | That is perfectly | A very easy way to book a hostel and have some recommendations | European university of germany location | this is scam app . I booked through it and they took 10$ and gave me confirmation however I contacted the owner he informed me that there is no confirmation and not available and he told me I have to book through other websites! scamm scammmm scamm 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 | Favorite app for hostels for sure. Love the Hostelworld fam! | the best deals ever!!! love it | It's ok and provides a decent amount of hostels. However, when I try to give a review I am getting an error and cannot submit it. So, I would not trust the reviews. Check trip advisor or other platforms before booking. Or use a different one altogether | one of the best app that help me when i travel and they have amazing stuff | Great app! | they lay out things very easy and the app is highly efficient and intuitive with easy ways to change currency and so on. usually find the best prices here too :) | Can't favourite hostels? Hostels appear in an order (paid for?) | One of the kind it is a perfect app | so excited | The app is easy to use and all the info I need is provided. plus, I love the convenience to cancel our change dates if necessary. | I always had nice experience in these hostels!! | efficient booking system | horrible | I used this app a lot, but now they run so many annoying ads on YouTube I decided to use competition instead. | 5-⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Five Stars | good but annoying I keep getting adverts to use Hostelworld when I already use it lol. algo is messed up | Great information | I've traveled around the world for years, and this app has been absolutely necessary | very useful | App for hostel lovers and travellers | great | Tuve que cancelar una reservación a causa de la cancelación de un vuelo y no me devolvieron el depósito que había ya pagado con mi tarjeta de crédito a hostelworld... Muy mal que al cancelar la reserva no reembolsen el dinero.... | No longer worth getting a hostel when they cost as much or more than a hotel. Plus more are moving to piece meal microtransactions which ruin the experience. | good | the site keeps having problems with credit card payments. seems like something you'd want to fix | easy to use plus so many options & information | I decided to delete app after downloading but the deletion process is really long and not friendly at all. There is no need to do it such long, please don't play with people's nerves and accounts/data. Thanks. | Excellent app for booking hostels. | Very nice application for hostels | love it! convenient and easy | Cool and easy app to use, but customer support is very shifty, you can't call them and have to go trough a long procedure to finally kinda get in contact and have to wait 10 hours for a response. In my case that was terrible, I accidentally booked twice because I didn't receive any confirmation the first time and the second time was the day of planned arrival in the hostel, if there was a warning or something, hey you already booked or hey, you wouldn't be able to cancel, but no nothing. | Godsend for solo travellers | easy to use and intuitive | By far the best app for booking hostels while travelling/backpacking. literally a must-download if you travel. | No longer able to see Linkups without booking the specific hostel. Being able to see linkups was a very useful feature to decide which hostel to book. | Fake app. I made a reservation but on reaching the hotel they said they were not even aware of an app/site called Hostelworld. I paid an amount for pre booking and there is ZERO customer support. Looters. | Thank you very much and useful ❣️🥰🥰 | I've used hostel world 4 times this year.the app is easy to use I've never had any problems with hostel world . until COVID they took 2 years to give me my deposit back. | always my best choice with hostelworld | Booked a hostel that wasn't even available, but it still showed up on hostelworld. I was turned away at checkin, but this company kept my deposit and refused to refund me | so far so good | This app looks very pretty on the surface, but it can't even find most of the US cities (large and small) that I enter into the destination box. It would be a very good idea to work on this issue if you want anyone to use it! | Great app that makes searching and booking easier! It also allows you to meet with other people in chats beforehand. I absolutely love this app and use it whenever I solo travel. Heck, some of these places, I'd even have a friend book their own stay with me! So worth it for socialization. You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you! | Easy and fast. | great app :) | Been using this app and website forever. It's never let me down. | Generally works fine,the discounts for the hostels seem quite good. Would be better if this could work offline just in case I don't have an internet. I'm happy with the app, allows me to go places I couldn't afford otherwise, especially in expensive cities like Dublin and London. Also only some hotels can be paid partly by card and the rest by cash on the spot. | Bad experience with no support I paid the advance of the booking for you The rest of the payment didnt want to proceed and its not my fault No support from you or from the hostel neither Anyway it was just an advance of 25€ but believe me you lost a client I dont recommend this app | Efficient and reliable - typically has cheaper pricing than I can find elsewhere | good app for Booking premium hostels | Hostelworld does not care about the safety of travelers at all. As long as they get money, they do not care if the hostel is safe or responsive. | Best App | Have found so many great hostels thru this app! The reviews are usually quite trustworthy | They don't help you if you cancel a reservation because you discover the hostel is lying on pictures | No CT locations | App didn't work. I tried to log in with 3 different browsers, but it just keeps hanging instead of logging me in. Total waste of my time. | worst service. They took my booking. when I reached hotel. hotel cancelled booking and denied room. In this situation Hostel world customer care did not respond to my mails or call. they took payment in dollors. My money also not refunded | weee | ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Great app for finding affordable places to stay around the world. My go to as a budget traveler. | Unusable. Installed app to try out the chat/social features, since to book I just use website. After the log in screen it sits loading forever. | Easy :) | Absolutely unreliable. I make a hostel reservation, I am charged the pre-payment from my bank account, and then I am informed by the hostel (not Hostelworld) that my booking with them is not valid. I contact Hostelworld's customer care and ask why my booking apparently has been cancelled. I receive NO reply or explanation, only an automated e-mail saying my Hostelworld booking has been cancelled. Nothing about the fact that I should get my €20.09 pre-payment back! I am massively disappointed. | simple, very easy to use. quick way to book | easy to use | perfect | Great experience ... | I love it. | Ok | ok | great services | It's a world wide party, lots of ladys | it works | doesnt remember date selected | Lame gukuss | Site etc is fine. But app missing features. You can't see distance by current location. You can't hide female only rooms. Basic things for travellers | My favorite Hostel booking app! | I went last year the location was amazing amazing the staff they are super nice and the breakfast was so yummy that's why I booked again this year | very good apps | IT didn't🚫seem to like my credit cards👎🏻‼️ | Booking Cancelled without intimation. We had to again look for different Hotels for stay. | excelente | Lost nearly $300 because Hostelworld refuses to take responsibility for the hostels they support. I've complained several times about a particular hostel (because my experience was awful), and they have done absolutely nothing about it. That hostel is still listed. I used to love the Hostelworld platform, but I think I will make the effort to contact hostels directly now instead. Also, the Share Your Trip feature hasn't worked for the last several stays. | Please update your app it's unable to fatch my location nither able to search any place. Useless aap. | I have found multiple amazing hostels through here and highly recommend this app. | wonderful 😘😊 | I'm unable to view my past bookings | Searching for locations doesn't work | Thank you the ease of an experience to book my reservation online (Theough the app). | Horrible App. Pricey. Plus they lie offering 75% discount. | This is one of the most user friendly hotel booking app I have ever used. Pretty budget friendly booking too. | wow the best app | good app | Good site but dependant on price from other sites + or -. I don't know why when it's a hostel site it has expensive hotels and some hostels above other site prices!? | muy Bien | great app to book | Pretty good, seems cheaper than others? | incredible app, works around the world | Broken app and website. The production URL for logging in seems failing everywhere. Unable to login during crucial time during VISA process | Everything is easy and flawless | great plate-forme | tight af | Does not work as expected. Uninstalling, moving on. | easy to use and love the layout/aesthetic! | grate app. .you get tips and honest feed back from people who where actually there. not the company painting a facility that's probably not honest about the .accommodation. don't get me wrong some people give bad reviews on some stuff. that's its kinda pity. but this app helps a ton.! I been using it for years! cheers and safe travels. | easy to use. reviews are very informative. respects privacy by not sending spam email. | Nice Application | It's Nice. | easy | Very good app | does not list all available properties in the area | Plenty of options for accomodation. 😃 | My favorite resource for finding truthful reviews on hostels. | When I used this app previously, meaning years ago, I would reserve a room or a bed somewhere, pay 15 or 20% of the total price of my stay and then pay the rest when I finally arrived at the hostel. This seems to have changed. I just reserved a bed in Vienna, I was charged a part of the total price as usual but then the rest was charged from my credit card the next day. If that's the way this service works now, then I have no use for it. | I've had a glitch happen where the selected dates shift by one day after I press search. | Nice app , made my trips cheap , I had the opportunity to know new people explore different cultures without paying crazy moneys on hotels. What could be done to make this app a better experience ? Plan to disactive memberships on of some of the hostels that has constant bad reviews over the years . some hostels become not available because they have been filled with long term living people , I hope you can find a way to mention this in your app . | Why did this app never show up on my recent apps? Very annoying | Best deal for short stay | Account password reset emails are not being sent to all email providers and customer care is useless. | very helpful | I can't get help to fix a extra debit in my account | good | Worst customer service ever, I wanted to get the information for the booking, The agent named with Hevandro disconnected my chat 3 times by saying all the best. I have chat transcript. It was really unprofessional and first and last experience with Hostelworld. | DO NOT BOOK THROUGH HOSTELWORLD. This company allowed us to book a hostel that they no longer worked with so when we showed up late at night the hostel has no recognition of our booking. The booking was showing in the app under upcoming trips until a few hours before where it disappeared in the app to the cancelled bookings which neither us or the hostel cancelled. We are now over £800 out of pocket and trying to get in touch with someone from Hostelworld is near impossible. | not trustable, only works when they felt fine to do it | We're going o | No ability to give negative reviews to places, i got scamed by a place they charged me full price after i canceled 1 month in advance even though the policy says you can cancel 1 week earlier and they only charge the reservation fee | somany hidden charges | My experience with using Hostelworld has been great. Both the hostels I stayed at were really nice places and a highlight of my mumbai trip. | Great app to find hostels buuuut many of the reviews for the properties are fake. 5 stars of they could verify the reviews that are genuine. | Used to be good but now full of scammy bot reviews, also another loop hole where the host can cancel your booking once you have got there and paid so you are unable to leave a legitimate review. A real shame cause this used to be good, never again hostelworld been burnt too many times now. | Will NOT help in the case of their own app preventing cancellation. You must reach out to the accomodation on your own | Amazing Service! | Avoid, complete scam. | I have been charged twice for same booking. I already sent email to both hostel andnhostelworld.. unfortunately, i m not getting any reply and for irony hostelworld says query solved.... Very unfortunate and pathetic... Intersting there are hidden charges by hostelworld around 20 euros. Which were no where mentioned during booking | We are living our second youth. we are a bit older and have had nothing but great luck with Hoatelworld | Terrible application. Cannot find any cities unless it is the capital or a popular tourist destination. It has very few hostels compared to reality which limits a lot the choices you have if you don't look elsewhere. | very very good | Sometimes the price is not the best one, but is useful | The only good thing about this app is the in-app chat group. But many times it doesn't work or allowing users to access the group | This site/app only accepts international transactions. it doesn't accept Indian currency | The customer service of Hostelworld seems to be unreachable. I wanted to create an account to cancel my booking and that didn't work. Tried reaching out via mail but haven't received a reply in 5 days. | Double price on arrival. I booked online and the price showed $29 dollars cad including taxes. I sat on a bus for 6 hours with no air conditioning finally got to the hostel at night and after going through all the check in procedures they let me know the taxes added up to an additional $20 dollars! This app was good but apparently it's a scam now. I talked to the hostel and they said oh it's in the fine print. Also the room was literally just big enough for the bed. 100% garbage | The site is easy to navigate, back up and restart | google reviews dont match up with reviews on website | I've installed the app but I'm unable to login, whenever I click on the login options nothing is happening, the continue with email button option is unclickable | The customer service is very unrealible once you actually have an issue with a booking. | What should I think? | Great for booking fast and reliable | No way to contact Customer support, no help provided in the event property cancells your booking. | app is super simple and easy to use | amazing app for backpackers and budget travelers they've never steered me wrong! | Best hostel booking app | Being able to search hostels would be better, rather than having to search location > dates > guests. sometimes you are given a recommendation for a place and just want to check it out | Used for years, always great! Love the interface. | Hostelworld is an absolute gem for solo travellers. It's so easy to get in touch with other people going to the same place as you and meeting new people. | easy to use and good hostels | Poor app | nice | Doesn't seem to work at all. Doesn't allow me to log in and wherever I search on whatever date it says ""0 properties found"" | They cancelled my trip without a notice, no answer from the support. I was already charged. I dont even know what to do and my trip is in two days. It's been a disaster because I can't even open the app anymore. It gives me an error | Horrible Experience | The serach engine is not working. I cannot find most places. | Sir please help me out I am having login problem | I use this app all over Europe and North america | Been an amazing asset on my interrail adventure! | Loveeee this app | I booked multiple hostels but it keeps only showing one hostel. Also when I click the link in the email of the next hostel I booked. This is very anointing, becaus eI wnat to cancel my second booking.

You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you!"",""I used to love this app, but it just updated and seems to have gotten rid of all the features I loved the most. You can no longer save favorites or make lists of hostels which is SO frustrating. Also, you used to be able to click the location and read written directions on how to get to the hostel from the owners before you book. It was so helpful seeing thos instructions before booking, not just having Google maps."",""They absolutely need to bring back the ability to create lists and save favorites. This is how I plan my trips ahead of time, and I've actually lost a ton of my research for a trip I've got coming up next week. I have no idea why they would have removed this. You also can't see a map of locations anymore, so it's fairly useless to try and book a decent location without having something else open to check every single one. I'll be using a different app until they fix this."",""Used to be a big fan of this app, but suddenly all my lists for planning upcoming trips are gone--i had spent hours reviewing properties & bookmarking the best places. Just gone & I need to book in the next few days! SO FRUSTRATING! Can no longer view any of the properties I've stayed at previously or even the cities or countries. Clearly didn't care at all about the user's needs when designing this garbage update. I dont have any reason to use this app anymore. I'll look for something else."",""I used to love this app and used it consistently for travel throughout 2019 and beyond till now. They recently did an overhaul of the app design and they took away Favoriting and having lists of hostels of the ones you favorited. It now makes it so much more difficult to keep track of the ones you want to stay in, the ones you liked when reading descriptions, and harder to narrow down where to stay when you can't click the simple heart to favorite a hostel and see it when scrolling through.""]",false,false,false,"com.hostelworld.app","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hostelworld.app&hl=en&gl=us"

Really simple and user friendly. | Great app for tracking! | Great way to track my travel. | Incredible app for tracking multi stop holidays / travels. Very simple to upload and crop photos and videos too. | While travelling it's a really great app to keep your friends and family updated where you are and what you're experiencing. I was able to send a link to those who I want to be able to read the blog. Polarstep is really easy to use and I really like it. | A fabulous tool to document your travel experiences! | Great app for sharing travel experiences with friends and family. Easy enough to use and edit, map showing places visited is very nice touch. Slight improvement could be to make uploading photos easier. | Great to follow loved ones | By limiting our posts to followers only, this app is a secure way to share travels with family members in real time. | Truly my favourite travel app. Spend some time on updating this as you travel and you will have the most amazing travel journal that you can print in hardback. cannot recommend this app enough! | When you have a traveller in the family, it's a great way to follow their experiences. | Love it ❤️ | It's a good app, I used it all along my travels and loved it. U can make little notes and pics alongside to keep a trace of what and where you've been. The only thing I'd like to notice is the impossibility to duplicate a trip you've done. It's not possible then to keep an original copy of your notes. | Great app as I'm not a FB person.. | Love using this app to track my journey and follow other friends A very useful app to create memories of places that you can share with your friends | Perfect | Great, easy way to record our travels and share with family and friends | Polarsteps, my travel companion! What an amazing app!! In the future you could add features to the travel stats like number of unesco world heritage sites visited and more. There's a lot of potential in this app. Please bring back the old flags design, those new flags in circle look strange in my opinion. | Brilliant app for keeping in touch with lived ones while travelling, for daily diary and for photo catalogue of trips. Excellent | I'm new to this app but it was recommended by friends and I'm loving it. | Great for recording and sharing trip details. | Really helps me capture the details of my holiday. By posting once a day I can keep on top of things and capture all the good stuff. Love the simple, well thought out interface. | Very useful and relatively easy to report on each step. It would help if it didn't jump back to the bottom after making an edit to the text. | Great app. Have used it for many years & really love it | Absolutely tedious. Someone recommended an app called Been but it got awful reviews on Android so I checked this one out instead. They're not really at all similar. This app is so tedious to input your locations of travel. It insists on you compiling your entire trio and adds in travel lines from point to point. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to just have one map up that shows all the places you've traveled, but instead you have to open each trip. The app lacks intuitiveness. | Great ap!! | Nice app to log your travels and make visible to your relatives | Can see exactly where my son was when travelling abroad. Very reassuring | Fantastic! | Great app to give family and friends a better idea as to where u are. Able to add pictures and also extra steps along the way. Quite happy user, although the down side is that i cannot reply to individual comments, only a general reply. Also I wanted to add that it would be great to be able to choose the mode of transport in between 2 distant points as it automatically defaults to plane even if it actually is a train travel. | Staat of valt met de inhoud natuurlijk. Maar een verademing in vergelijking met andere sociale media. | Love this app. I've been using it for years. Would be helpful if you could see a bigger photo when creating the book on a pc. The tiny picture isn't helpful! Even more helpful would be that you could edit the photo withing the website/app! | Excellent app for keeping our family updated on our travels. | Great app with good user experience to share my trip to my family and friends 👌 | A great app to see the travel blog and photos of family travelling in Asia. You can really zoom in to the exact location they are staying (I guess they have to be in an area with internet) | Polarsteps is a great way to record your travels, include photos and videos of what you have seen. A great way to share with your friends and relatives as they can track you on a map of the country you are travelling in. It would be great to be able to choose a mode of transport and also have a leaving time, not just arrival time. | Brilliant app and can't believe it is free. I have been using polar steps for about 3 years and it is a great app that does exactly what it is supposed to. I don't know how they can keep it free but if it wasn't I would pay for it. Our family follow our adventures every year and we love looking back on our travels to remind ourselves of what we have been up to. I highly recommend it. | My favourite travel tracker. Very easy to use. | Great app | Great for tracking your journey. | -Wonderful way of sharing the journey. | Interesting visualization of following somebody's journey. The UX however can and needs to be improved for editors. Multiple times I've lost some carefully drafted texts and had to start over again. Also numbering the Pictures and being able to include a short description would help the viewer to follow the journey. | Love the satellite tracking and travel stats. Very useful travel diary. Keeps friends and family up to date on your journey. | A great way to share our travelling experiences with family and friends. Text editing is a bit glitchy, but apart from that it's an easy system to use. | Great app. Easy user interface. Location service doesn't drain battery much at all. A little more functionality would be amazing but for a free app it ticks all the boxes. | It has taken a bit of time to get the hang of it.. But now find it really easy to use | It takes a bit of time to get used, but it's very good. | Great app, easy to use and upload photos and trip info. Our friends and family enjoy seeing our updates | Great way to follow our sons travels. | Easy way to note your trip and inform homies.. | Easy to use | It keeps crashing on me. So frustrating as Ive lost my trips. | Great app, simple and easy to use. | Easy to use following someone on an overseas trip. | I have to say this is the best app I've ever used. It's easy to use from the outset, easy to edit, save drafts and upload pics and videos as well as making comments to other travellers too. I particularly like that you can highlight recommendations too, such as restaurants, with links to apps such as Trip Advisor...brillisnt. I'm about to order an album too. To all the developers involved...5 Platinum stars. | Polarsteps has made documenting our Ultimate World Cruise fun. Friends and family enjoy traveling along and I don't have to deal with the social media trolls. Hopefully future updates will enhance book formatting options. Great job Polarsteps. | Fantastic way to keep people at home updated on travels, additionally serving as an easy to use diary platform to help reflect on and digest your experiences. | All good 👍. | Great platform to record trip for friends and family, easy to use and navigate | Very addictive (in a good way) and greatly designed app. Tracking works very well and does not drain your battery. Try it! | Super app to keep track of your travels. | Absolutely great for seeing what loved ones are up to and where they are. | Been great to follow the journey of friends. | Absolutely brilliant | Love following my daughter's trip this way! | So far, l have only followed my daughter, but it is great to see the different places | Seems great so far | It is a realy nice app to let your friends and family have part of your travels, without needing to call them every day:) | Nice way to follow friends. | A vivid and visual way to describe your trip to others. | Lovely interface to follow people on their travels | Great app to catalog experiences throughout a trip - and to share them with others. | Love this program!! I order a hard bound copy of all of my adventures to keep my memories in one place. Use this whenever i travel. The new guide feature is handy for finding things to do too! | Can't rate this app highly enough. Our son is travelling across east Asia and friends and family have been able to share in his travels through photos and regular updates. It's a lovely and non intrusive way to keep in touch and will act as a lovely final travel blog. | Love this app, I'm using it for travelling at the moment but I really wish there was an option to caption photos individually! | Beautiful app, really useful both for private tracking or sharing or public sharing. Très belle application, excellent pour partager son voyage en images et videos. Peut partager publiquement ou de façon semi privé ou simplement garder son historique de voyage. | My go to whenever I travel , its one of my favourite apps | Amazing app, can't believe how brilliant it is, wish I'd heard of it years ago. Brilliant record of our trip to South Africa from Scotland. | An excellent app to track your trips and letting your friends and family be part of the journey. It's great that you can share locations, photos and favorite spots. Would be amazing to be able to create a shared trip with the person you're travelling with so both travellers can upload pictures, etc. 👍 | Nice app for keeping track while traveling. I wish there was an option to add captions for specific phptos. Also, a possibility to edit and write descriptions on the laptop and justbon the phone/tracking device. | It took a bit to work it out but now I am very happy with Polarsteps and so are my non face book friends. | Very good app! | Love the idea but the app is not intuitive. I've been trying to add the location to the trips and still have no clue! | Great way to let friends and family track your travels | Great app family can see we're we have been. | Great app, amazing for planning my trips with the guides and keeping my memories alive! | Following my friends' World cruise and this app has been amazing and kept me up to date daily as my friends post their experiences. | We are using this app now for over 5 years and we love it. The collection of our Polarsteps travel books is increasing. One of the things we love most is the way it shows where you have been during and after your trip, both in the app and in the book. | Perfect to record your travels! | First thing it did was demanding me to create an account without first telling what the app can do for me. Many apps do need your info so they can pester you with advertising emails. Uninstalled immediately. | It's a really good way to capture and share travel experiences. The editing is a bit primitive, with the screen leaping about, but otherwise 5*. | Brilliant | Great app for documenting your travels and keeping memories, and allowing others to follow and share. | Great | A very easy app to use.So lovely to follow your love ones on their travels. I've got all the family using it, even the Seniors have the hang of it.. | Nice idea, doesn't allow u to update photos if the dates are not current. And every 15 second it notifies me that I need to share my contacts ... Not ver intutive and the UX is poor | Super concept | Easy to follow friends and family on their trip | Love it ,fantastic | We have been able to follow our son and his girlfriend's amazing journey and see their photos along the way. It really helps to keep up with their travels! | Great for keeping the family informed. | I am using this app on my open end world trip and highly recommend it! | Great app to use for documenting travels, just what I was looking for! | Great way to stay intouch | I really like this application because it allows me to have track of all my trips as long as add photos and descriptik of places visited. Great plus that it works offline and share to social networks is easy. | This app is exceptional, it's so nice to see where friends and family are visiting in the world and to correspond with them in real time. | Poor menu navigation design. Every time I scroll through foto's in a step and I go a millimeter up or down instead of left or right and the foto's drop away and because of the menu design I have to scroll through all the foto's again and it will happen again and again. Please fix the UI! I did find out later I can mitigate the problem by scrolling through photos fullscreen. Otherwise I think it's a good app, | Great app. Recommended to friends and family | Love this app, family can follow and share our holiday. | I love this place that allows me to track my steps as i travel | Used it since 2022 and recorded about 5 trips. 10 days self drive round Iceland: On a cruise ship across the Atlantic; Cruise ship to Antarctica etc. To save data, you can post a few photos to mark the location first and upload more later. | Excellent | Until now, I am satisfied with the App. But I should say it's not easy at the beginning to understand how it works. | Excellent app | I've used the app for several years now and its functionality has improved in that time. I use it as a travel diary to track where I've been and share stories with friends. Unhappily very few of my friends use it. It's a great alternative to FB for those who want to share or track travel info. | Fantastic way of following daughter's big trip | Works well and lovely to keep up with friends and family on their trips | I am enjoying Polarsteps 😉 | It's lit | My daughter is using Polarsteps to post about her travels and it is a great way for her to keep a record while also updating friends and family. | Some additional formatting options would be cool, bit it's clean, intuitive and no ads! | Love this app, it helped me keep track of where we'd been and what we'd seen. So nice to see it displayed on a map too. The only thing that I'd change is when you press into a step, you have to swipe to see your photos, meaning it can be hard to find a specific one if you take a lot of photos in one place. It would be better in my opinion if they displayed down the page so you can simply scroll to see everything. | This is a great way to keep intouch with your friends. Instead of independent. | Awesome app, we used it for our journey across Asia. Easy for family and friends to keep up to date. Can't believe it's free ! Only issue is that you can reply to people's comments individually, which would be a good feature to add. | good up to write a trip story | I have used this app for years. Not only can you look back at memories and quickly view photos, dates and locations, you can order an already made photo book. | Nice apps. | Love that I can map and chronicle my trips and share it with family and friends | Easy to use, possible to use more then one phone with same account | Keeping it up as we travel on our long NZ trip is more than writing a diary. Those that want to can follow us. Looking forward to making a book. | Good to excellent. Still trying to understand how to make sure tracking does not have gaps. | Great app to track your travels and let your followers know what you,ve been up to | Overall great app! I'm always keen on using it! Here are some ideas that would make the experience even better: 1) improve location search (it doesn't find much) and allow moving the point after 2) private notes in each step, regardless of the whole trip visibility 3) overall notes for the whole trip 4) ability to crop/zoom/rotate images in steps 5) ability to exlucde countries from a trip (layover at an airport doesn't really count as visiting the country) 6) a presentation mode in the web app | Keeping up with the travels of friends and relatives whenever they post. Not for the public. | So slick looking ! Easy enough to navigate once my 54 year old brain had figured it out! My followers love it to. Far better thzn having a massive whatsapp group | Works well each time & every time. | Great way to record your trip | The app is so easy to use, which I love. You can add pictures and videos to each step that you add so you can go back and look at what you did in each area. It's also a great way for family and friends to know what you are doing on your trip. The best bit is that you can make a travel book at the end, which may seem a bit pricey, but seeing as the app itself is free to use, I think it is a good price for what you get. | Fantastic app that functions as intended. I enjoy recommending it to others. | This is a fun app for people who travel. It's a great way to organize travel photos on the go. Followers can receive notifications and make comments on your trip. I do wish the comments would attach to the photo rather than the ""step"" but, that's not a major issue. | Great. | Such an awesum app to view. Following my nephew n his whanaus trip round NZ | Good. Just hard to select dates sometimes. | I really like this app but please I beg you: add an auto save feature. It's really frustrating to start writing my step description from the beginning again just because I got distracted and came back too late, which happens a lot when you're on a trip! I know the save draft feature exists but it's too easy to forget. As an Android dev myself I know you can implement Activity restoration at least, and incremental auto save locally and server side should be a top priority! I'll give 5⭐ then! | Excellent idea, excellent app! Allows me to ""remotely"" travel with people I know (or sometimes don't know). Great way to see hidden corners of the world :) | Love this app. It allows for family to keep in touch, it is easy to use & provides a great record of your holidays. | Fun way to share stuff with friends and family, and also good to look back on! Easy in use! | Fantastic app, easy and fun to use. | Great app. Still using the app 5 years later. A wonderful way of documentingy travels, keeping in touch with friends and creating a great memory. Only sorry I can't locate my 2018/19 trip. | Love this app!! Great way to update a lot of people at the same time about your travels. My friends and family absolutely love it!! | Like traveling along, great! | Fantastic app for logging trips and journeys. Easy to use and share | 4.5 would be pretty accurate, overal great app that let's you share your adventures, and keep track of them for yourself. There are definitely some optimizations to be made, like how to upload pictures which aren't made with your phone. Edit for clarity: you can upload pictures from other folders/albums, it's just more tedious to do so. The app sometimes rejects one of the pictures (maybe a format issue?) and then it fails to upload all selected pictures. Then the user needs to upload the 1by1 | Love, love, love! The only thing I wish this app did differently, is I wish I could add captions to each photo instead of only one caption per step. Otherwise, it's a really cool way to build a memoir of our trip and share it in real-time with friends and family! | Great way of sharing a trip with friends and family in one place. | Great app, however it's auto added a stop in the middle of the Atlantic ocean I never went to that I can't delete. Whenever I go to edit step, it says 'could not load api'. | Excellent way to follow our family on their travels | On the whole this app has done me proud, but it's unpredictable. When I've diminished it to check a fact, everything I've written has disappeared when I pull it up again. Sometimes it won't let me continue editing and only offers Publish. I've had to reload photos on a number of occasions. Telling me what was on my bucket list was unnecessarily intrusive. In summary, when the app works it's very good indeed and my followers are delighted but software issues still need more work perhaps. | Great way to capture travel memories. Printed albums are easily generated and are a memory for years! | Fun, easy to use and fantastic for all travellers :) | Fantastic way to track and share our travels with friends and family | Best app for journaling your travels on the go. The guides are also really handy for inspiration on what to See, where to Stay and Eat. Super easy to share a web link to friends and family | My favourite travel blog app! | 4.5 stars - app is intuitive to use and provides nice platform to upload pictures / videos and add a little description. Super easy to share with friends & family so they can like & comment. Only suggestion I'd like to see as improvement: for travelling between two locations I'd love to set or adjust the transportation used | Great app and so easy to use. Love the map it produces and the longitude and latitude markings. Family and friends love to follow our travels, and you have the added bonus of a travel book to purchase if you wish. Personally, it's a great aid to my photo album journalling later | Superb | This is a fabulous place to keep track of your trips and share your journey with friends and family. | great way to update close ones on a travelling journey, and very good UI when it comes to making 'steps'. I would only add some 'flexibility'. When swiping through photos of one step, a strong swipe makes it that you go to the next step and therefore skip video/photos unintentionally. | The best app for keeping friends and family updates on your travels.

Someone recommended an app called Been but it got awful reviews on Android so I checked this one out instead. They're not really at all similar. This app is so tedious to input your locations of travel. It insists on you compiling your entire trio and adds in travel lines from point to point. Also there doesn't seem to be a way to just have one map up that shows all the places you've traveled, but instead you have to open each trip. The app lacks intuitiveness."",""I use this app for tracking where I've been. It's very useful and cool. Easy to use, intuitive. I haven't tried the more advanced features but based on how well the app works overall, I would expect them to work very well. I took one star off after my last trip because of the app's tendency to go to sleep for hours, leaving long straight lines that don't capture the detail of an otherwise complex route, which is unfortunate."",""I am using PolarSteps for the first time and am loving it. I don't have data on this trip and the app still is able to identify where I've been. There's so much this app does. I've been sharing it with other travelers as well. Some things I would like the developers to consider moving forward. Ability to: *add contributors so all on trip can participate *add captions to pictures *rearrange actual steps We are still traveling, so I will have to come back to review the photo book. ❤️ this app"",""I love this app, not only to share my travels with family and friends but also to look back myself! I would love it if pictures could be placed on maps automatically (from the photo meta data) - strava has been doing that for years! I'd really like to add past trips, especially backpacking trips, for which I didn't have my phone on, but it's too much work to do it manually."",""i love this app! couple thoughts:. it would be great if you added a feature to drop a \""waypoint\"". it's not actually a step that you document but it does you to more accurately Mark a path. the second option would be to make points on the journey moveable. sometimes the app puts a point thats not accurate. would love the oportunuty to move it.""]",false,false,false,"com.polarsteps","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polarsteps&hl=en&gl=us"
