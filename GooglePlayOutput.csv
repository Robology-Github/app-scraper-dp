You can create and collaborate your entire trip using their mobile apps and the web app. I used the pro option to export everything to Google Maps which was really useful for planning days out. | i like ability to manage my own created itinerary. would like to see ability to search for restaurants and make reservations through the app. | it's a great app for those who love to travel | Such a great planner for our holiday! Loved the option to personalise costs for particular places. Not sure the pro version was worth it, the free option was pretty solid on its own. I would have liked pop-up reminders for events, but it was easy to get up to speed. A little slow at times. | I started using Wanderlog in 2023 to plan my Tokyo trip. From then on, I have not used any other trip planners. Wanderlog is easy to use and I like it that there are many fun recommended sights/places for the countries I travel to. I also love the Optimize Route feature as it helps me plan the itinerary more efficiently. In addition, the Customer Support was very prompt in answering my questions. Overall a great travel app! | Haven't used it for long but so far I am in love with the app, it has made it easier for my family to plan our trip and be able to all add things we would like to do and then organize everything | Free app optional to pay for extra service, easy to re-arrange the location with diff date, also can access it in web page too, happy with this app! | I am very pleased with the application. It serves my purpose well. I appreciate having everything in one convenient location. I can easily mark places I want to visit and view them on a map. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly. This application is an excellent tool for planning vacations. I have used it for my second vacation and will undoubtedly continue to use it in the future. | Would recommend! Very smart and convenient for planning the trip ahead | This app was great, allowed me to have all my travel plans in one place, very easy to use! | I love this app! Stay organized in one place! I used to use MS Word for all of the details but I love how Wanderlog automatically provides links and other info about all the places I have on my itinerary. I also like that I can make my own categories for other information. I'm using this app for four trips I'm in the process of planning and it's great. It's helpful for small trips of a couple days and two week long trips. | great tool for planning. organize evrerything in one place. Very flexible. easy to plan a road trip with many different stops. amazing amount of resources. | Well organized, easy to send info from my email confirmations, also updated expenses if included from reservations. Some interesting recommendations, easy to add places of interest to itinerary. Could be better in providing directions with options. | absolutely indispensable for trip planning! | Meh... Useless app with prev pay | Very useful to manage trips activities | Very convinient for planning a trip. It's quite laggy sometimes. Hope it will get better in the future. | easily captured all my trip details in one place! I could even refer back to the content that I forwarded if I had any doubts. | One the greatest tools ever for planning a trip. Ive used it on my 26 days trip to Japan and no other tool has been so usefull for planning and keep diary of all places we visit and wanted to visit! Its also incredibly easy to add things to your own planner from other peoples planners to easily build up your own Wanderlog 😉 | The perfect app for planning and organizing trips. | This app seems really cool but upon initial download, the amount of pop ups that show and redirects that the app does are incredibly distracting. I'll update the review as I use the app more however. | The idea is cool but the execution is poor. The loading time is long even though I have a pro account and offline access. In a good app this should mean loading and updating in background, but here is have to sit through seconds of loading on a high speed connection. Can't add regular transportation modes such as ferries to the planner. The auto-importer misses a lot and if you turn on Gmail auto-search it duplicates a lot. There are better products out there. | Great way to collect all your ideas for your trip then arrange them day by day. I really enjoy the map function to easily see where all your chosen attractions are located. | Useful app but lags a lot (I haven't seen this much lag in any other app) | A really useful app with a lot of options. Sadly it is pretty laggy on mobile and small things like swapping items on the itinerary from one day to another are error prone. The view on mobile can also get too cluttered, especially if you plan long trips with multiple stops. Also, it's sad that you can only purchase a yearly subscription to get premium features. Monthly subscriptions make way more sense for this type of app | great resource for planning | very helpful in planning a trip to a new place. It helps map your itinerary and shows many little things that help you complete your trip without thinking you missed something special. | I searched for a free app. This is not free. | I just found THE app for travelling! Amazing one-stop platform to put everything together, from flight details to lodging to places of interest... BONUS stuff: able to create notes, share with co-creaters, best routes, recommended places to go for dine and play... Thank you Wanderlog team for creating this awesome app! 😁 | The premise of the app is great and it has a lot of great features, but lately it has been extremely glitchy, for example the ""add"" button for new places to visit doesn't work for some sites no matter how much I press it, also the loading time is really frustrating. Today I made a new travel plan and painstakingly added more than 30 places to visit, only to find a few minutes later that the trip was nowhere to be found on my account :(( | I started planning a two week international trip with this app, so easy and intuitive. I love it and have recommended to friends who travel | awesome | This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used. it's just so well thought out. I am putting this at the top of the list of my favourite app. The web app is even better! | Really helpful to have all your travel information in one place! The explore page is great for inspiration and ideas. The interface can look a bit cluttered but once you familiarise yourself with it, it's really simple to use | I really love how this app organizes all your details. Especially love the feature where you email your reservations, and it plugs it into your iteniary! I attached screenshot of park passes, entered addresses, and it offers up other places to go and see. With a family of 7, I have to stay on top of every detail and reservation: Wanderlog makes that so easy! | I love this app! It's so easy to use, all your trip details in one place, easy to edit & manage agendas. It also opens the door to experiences you may have missed or overlooked by showing other points of interest, restaurants & experiences. I think they have covered everything you want to keep track of, all in one place! | excellent travel planner app | I stumbled on wanderlog a while ago and saw an amazing opportunity to use it for my trip to Korea. It was really easy to use, the interface was good. For me the best feature is the ability to have a map that shows the distance from one place to another. All in all I will definitely use this app again. So amazingly easy to plan for a trip. | Good idea and app but you will get tons of ""ads"" for hotel etc. But the Pro price is exactly what's wrong with todays subscription model. It's a travel app and the only option is to pay for a whole year, and it cost almost €60 (!). I also get a more expensive price in the app when i'm logged in than what their website say (€50). €60/year for Pro that most people will use for offline mode and attachments is crazy. Better to pay for e-sim. | La mejor aplicación para planificar viajes nacionales e internacionales. | I used the free version to plan my upcoming 1 month solo trip for Europe. Is a very good app which help me plan my itinerary easily and handy!! I even introduce my sister to use this app and she love it. | This app is not free, it is $50 per year after they collect data. I don't mind paying for an app, but don't lie. | awesome app! just what I was looking to plan our trips. full feature and very easy to use. | I have been the designated trip planner for our friend group for almost 10 years now. I have used apps like Tripit, Google Travel, splitwise, Citymapper, you name it! Once I found Wanderlog, I deleted all other apps. Wanderlog is all these apps combined into one!! And it's virtually glitch free. We recently took a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. Planning and executing has been a breeze. The developers have thought about every possible scenario. Budget summary could use some fine tuning. | Amazing app with all the features I need for planning trips. I shared with my family, friends, and today with coworkers. Looking forward to improvements as this app progresses. | absolutely love this app, I use it to keep track of places and things I want to see and also use it to log my trip as a trav journal! | Nica app. But it has many functionalities missing from the free version . | Fabulous app that has been so valuable in coordinating our trip. Everything you need is right here! AAA+ | Great tool to help plan and navigate our trips | Good functionality but I find the constant 'helpful' popup tips very grating. I think they are a good idea but the fact that it forcibly changes what's displayed on the screen and drags you away from what you were trying to do is too intrusive and instead of reading then I've just been clicking them away - hopefully I'm almost through them all now. Also maybe a personal preference but I find the text and interface a bit too zoomed in/not dense enough, maybe there could be a setting for this? | Great app for travel planning. Has the ability to add places, notes, etc. A great all round travel app | LOVE being able to share the trip itinerary with others. LOVE being able to easily re-arrange the things I've selected to do. LOVE multiple sources to find best of the best w regard to dining, etc., Can't wait to try it LIVE!! | this is a great system and can even quickly start navigation in rental cars. | really like this app. helped with planning | Excellent app, has made it possible for me to plan complex trips overseas and keep organized | I organised my Kyoto trip with the help of Wanderlog. I had an amazing good time. Now I am planning my next trip in July. Thank u Wanderlog. | I moved to Wanderlog from TripIt because of the clean, modern interface of the application and the website. I also like the map feature where it plotted on the map all you lodgings. Customer service was responsive and fast. Overall this great apps helped me on my 5 weeks trip to South America with many flights, hotels, car rentals and activities.AI integration looks promising as well. | Really good app very helpful to be notified when places will be closed | I love this app! It made trip planning so much easier to have everything in one spot, and so intuitively. Very user friendly and helped by allowing me to research options and have them pulled up in advance | Great Planning Tool | User unfriendly. Can't search within trip. Useless. If I could give less stars, I would. | this app has been amazing for planning my trips. absolute life saver so easy to use | Just used Wanderlog to plan my vacation and it was fantastic! Highly recommend giving it a try. | Amazing tool to plan and organize your trip. Saves a ton of time. There's a lot of room for improvement, but what they've got is worth 5 stars for how useful it's been. | Very good for travel planning. Easy to use. | I love the ability to organize to the level available even in the free version. Looking forward to what features and functionality are available in the paid version. | Powerful organizer for travel plans. | After much researching, I decided to give Wanderlog a go and it was pretty neat. A lot of things can be synced by forwarding hotel and flight emails, adding the cost of individual places / activities / food, adding links etc. The itinerary makes the trip easy to navigate, way better than Spreadsheet 🤭 So, thanks Peter Xu! For creating this wonderful app. I've started using for my next trip with my girlfriends :) | Very good apps for travel. My whole trips is plan well because got the Wonderlog, very helpful. | Great travel planning app with new features added regularly. | brilliant, everything is in one place, I love it | I have used Wonderlog for many of my trips. | The app keeps crashing on some places of the map view. I thought it was depending on the number of places I had added but then I realized this was not the cause. I also found quite annoying to add notes in the Itinerary view. Considering this is a touristic app, you should add other payment ways to buy the subscription as I tried to do it from the Google Play Store and because their country limitations I wasn't able to do it. | Too many pop ups, even after disabling tips. Would be nice to have a calendar view of itinerary as well as a download to excel or pdf function. | so far, to help on planning it has been helpful. it aggregates the info from my mails | a great app to consolidate travel details into a single itinerary. It's especially handy when you use multiple platforms to book flights, accommodation, tours and train/car travel as it's easy to check that booking dates are correct. | Not for me too nosy and seems to want to take over I installed Thanks | good and nice | I've only used it for a few days, but so far everything works great! It's great to be able to gather all the details of a trip in one place instead of searching email and texts and saved documents. | Great features | I love this app! I'm that person who is the planner of the group and always has a Google Sheet. I LOVE the organization/the mapping functionality of this app & the ability to have different ""layers"" of the map so I can see locations for different days or purposes (a map showing me everything I want to do! or a map showing me all the restaurants I'm considering! So helpful). Also love emailing the app to auto populate hotel reservations and train/flight reservations onto the itinerary!! | While not perfect, this is the best travel app I've tried so far. Great way to organize my itinerary, get directions, see suggested stops, and more. I'll keep using it! | Best travel planning app ever. | Very good App. Useful when you want for city break's with many things to, like Paris | love this app, planning a trip to Hawaii, this was a great help to keep track of everyone's tickets and itinerary. Bravo! | Extremely helpful. It's now one of my favorite apps. We just got back from a four day weekend, and it was fantastic to have all the information in one place. No more searching through email and texts to find information about your next stop. Directions are ready with just one click. We are planning a longer vacation in August. As I make reservations or book flights, I just forward the email to the app. The info will be right there when I need it. Great for detailed planners and for casual trips. | Would've been a great travel planning app, but I had lists just disappear without any explanation and have to remake them again. Will reach out if it happens again. | UPDATE: Plus one star for responding and at least attempting to fix the issue. Pro version still very expensive and a poor value, especially when their system burps at inconvenient times. Garbage app. Made the mistake of purchasing Pro. It won't automatically add vrbo's or other similar bookings and won't let you forward emails or enter bookings manually either. TripIt here I come. | wonderful tool, forever evolving, like travel itself, to make it easier, more intuitive and indespensible. | UNINSTALLING - Was given the impression that this app was free compared to competitor apps that are ""overpriced annual subscriptions"". This also has an annual subscription price, which is required in order to do anything in the app beyond the 7 day trial. $70 for an app to plan a budget friendly road trip... talk about ironic. | AI is fairly accurate and the recommendations are legit. I hope to see more exclusive deals to justify the subscription. | Best App for Traveling | organizing my trip in a couple of weeks and I'm already in love. THIS is exactly what I needed to sort out distance, opening hours and other things that would stress me out if I didn't have the details all laid out in a concise, neat way. | Offline access behind a paywall? LOL. Thats a new one. That means there's no acceptable free version as many trips you can end up with poor or no connectivity. | Really difficult to separate free from paid pro app. There is no activities/tour tab in this app, which makes it useless for me. The graphics are beautiful. I like the way it pulls in suggested activities and shows the map but without an activities... | This is a great app for travel planning. I found several spots I would have missed and I loved being able to plan out our days with travel time estimates to avoid packing to much in to a single day. | incredible product. what would take me several sites to research and plan can now be done on one site lots of features and simple to use | Excellent! It's the most complete and intuitive app available. 100x better than spreadsheets, helps you to keep track of expenses, and also suggests attractions you should go to during your trip. I love it! | Stuff of nightmare. Pop ups everywhere. So many screens, sections, buttons, navigation, suggestions, recommendations, automation. OMG cannot understand a bit. Started with paid version. Then immediately uninstalled, phew. What a relief. | have added 21 stops and it works great, love it so far. | easy for group travel collaboration. Great tool! | This is a great way to plan my trip! | Travel planning for a family of 4 is tough but Wanderlog made it feel intuitive. We were able to plan for multiple cities with multiple hotels like a breeze. It uses other popular productivity tools to superpower the mapping and itinerary information as well. I'm thinking about going pro because of the quality. | so easy to navigate | I'm not much of a trip planner, but I recently took a trip to South Korea, and this app was a life saver. It was really easy to use, and I loved how flexible it was. You can plan an itinerary and upload travel documents to it. It gives you recommendations of where to go/see and includes a map with the route you planned on your itinerary. It is a stress free app with so many cool and helpful features that I will for sure use this app again for my next big trip! | Amazing app and I haven't even tried to paid version yet. I'm usually an extensive Google doc planner but this app makes it so much easier! The organization is so helpful and visually pleasing. It makes it so much easier to see the full picture without having to scroll scroll scroll | the best so far for travel plan. Prefer if it's not too cluttered. Some locations can't be added into the itinerary, don't know why | awesome for managing your holiday especially when you're doing multiple cities or countries | The app has many really great features, but unfortunately I sometimes find myself still going to email app or Google Maps, because of performance. It takes about 8 seconds on my phone between tapping the app in the launcher and (no interaction) seeing my itinerary' today view. | service is great, but the app freezes/stalls pretty regularly. Could use some UX improvements for the rearranging process on mobile too | I mostly used the app to save destinations that I wanted to visit. It was good to just come back to the app when I was in Boston to look at my points of interest to visit on the fly. | I travel a lot and this particular app is great as it pulls all of my information in and if it is unable to, it allows me to add it to my itinerary. It sorts all of my travel, lodging, tours, etc. I can add attachments, map locations, Transit cards, | I used Wanderlog to plan a 10-day trip to Italy, covering Venice Florence and Rome. The app is a great way to organize the trip plan in one place, and while on the trip, to navigate from place to place through links to Google maps. Fantastic tool if you like to be organized and plan out daily itineraries. | Great app for uploading itinerary. The dates and activities could be better formatted. I love the uploading confirmation emails to the app for it to automatically update the page. Also, love the trip recommendations. So useful. | amazing | WOW! This is a fun, very easy and useful app to use. I'm still testing and am planning our itinerary for an upcoming vacation. Wish list: 1. Add a search function so that I can find things in my overview, itinerary and notes. 2. Add export function to Google Calendar. 3. The expense sharing function does not handle changes in currency. | Excellent tool, even though the importing part can be improved...it helps a lot to organize and visualize your trip | just try whoa its blow my mind its a great app | cool planner | Awesome application easy to use and very informative 👍 | really helped plan our trip to Japan with 4 other people. made it super easy to see people's suggestions and then make an itinerary with it | Installing app for the first time. Also I am not able to skip the subscription page. I don't need the features which come with the subscription. I just want to use the free version. Even if I click the X on the top-right, I return back to the previous screen. I simply don't want to leave my credit card info. | so far so good. | Good apps! | I'm so glad this app exist | The app has a nice user experience and you can insert everything you need in one place. I don't know if it's my phone but sometimes it gets slow to use and i have to wait for the command that I get. | LOVE THIS APP! Organize places by type and see places or itinerary on the MAP! So helpful in planning, and sharable itinerary ❤️ I will be using Wanderlog for all of my trips moving forward!! | This is my 3rd time using this app for my trips. Easy to use. Recommended. | The functionality is good but the app feels slow and clunky when you move things around. Itinerary view is not easy to scroll and you can't just move from places to visit to the itinerary section. | Love this app! Makes trip planning so much easier! The only thing I'd ask for is if they could add Naver Maps for Korea, because it's almost impossible with Google Maps, some of the restaurants or cafes you want to go to don't exist. But apart from that, it's a great app! 👍 | Overall a great app to really help plan and group things. However the app is quite clunky at times, especially when wanting to ""rearrange"" places or notes around. It scrolls back up to the top and sometimes holding and dragging the item gets laggy and becomes annoying. I would use it again but these small things could do with some improvement! | Excellent app! This app was a huge help when planning my big trip to California with my friends. This app made it so easy to plan all the travel destinations we were planning on going. This app has so many good features like offline maps and adding hotel and flight reservations. I love all the features it has and I highly recommend this app! | Very easy to add places and rearrange. I would have enjoyed a longer description of the landmark was attached to each site. Each day was color coded which was very helpful. | helped to group activities together | First time using app. Will never travel without it again. Fun, interactive way to trip plan. Instant win. | absolutely fantastic app. I use it for all my trips | Very good app with a lot of great features to help plan your itinerary | Helpful to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip from flight, rental car, places staying, coordinating activities and restaurants. This was especially helpful for preplanning with a traveller with Celiac disease. | Very easy to use, and incredibly convenient. | very comfortable and helpful! | Nice and easy to use. | awesome | love the app. been using it for the last 4 months to prepare/plan for our family trip in June. it's cool you can budget everything out, add hotel reservations, attach event tickets, and split the budget up if needed. searching the map feature for things to add to your itinerary is so much fun! | Very nice and easy travel planner 👌 | It can't find any cities to Start | This is a wonderful, full featured travel planning app. It is making an extended trip so much easier for my whole family to keep track of. Thank you so much for creating this indispensable tool! I didn't need to pay for the subscription to make great use of this app, but I did (after finding the app so helpful while planning) for my own benefit, yes, but also in thanks to support the developers. I highly recommend this app. | Always a Pop-up window open, can't use it | I'm so glad this app exists. It's better than just writing down a list of places you want to go. However, sometimes when you type stuff in, the screen lags for a second.

All reservations pertaining to a trip in one place. | Couldn't create an account. It said the password I was entering to create a brand new account didn't match their records. Password requirements were vague as well. | i love it better with upgrade this time as the tickets and hotels, and activities automatically links with Trip It app. very handy | Helpful and easy to use by review of reservation and booking mails. Personalization of design could be improved | so far so good | I dont see any benefit to pro. It seems a lot to pay just for flight notifications. We already get that from the airline. I would like to be able to add more than 3 photos/pdf so that everything is in one place. It's a little archaic not to. Also, it's a trip planner, add a packing list. Again, so it's all in one place. This is my 1st time using this app and I'm travelling in 11 days. I'll edit when I return! | ""Error: saving failed. Please try again"". CONSTANTLY. Duplicating plans to different trips changes the trips' dates automatically, even after editing the duplicated plan to reflect new dates. Mass-editing still not possible after a decade plus. Amateurish effort and a childish attempt by intuit to hoover data. | Paid for the Pro which has some benefits like adding travel documents and updated gate alerts, but whenever my airline sends me updated flight times (which seems to be frequent) , it adds the updated flight as a new flight and then I don't know which leg of each trip is the new or old and I have to delete the whole trip and start new. Very frustrating. Updated to add it used to be better at forwarding emails and automatically inputting information. Half the time they go to unfiled documents now | Great way to organize a trip with multiple people planning, numerous hotels and stops, and flying more than one airline. | great app for planning | If you travel for business or pleasure, this would be a very useful addition. It take organizing to a new level. | soooo handy, highly recommended | Excellent travel companion. The stuff you need, in a simple presentation, and that's it. | fab app to get all your travel plans organised and in one place | Awesome | Perfect for long trips, especially when a lot can change 🙂. | A great place to hold all the details of your trip. | I've been using this app for 13 years and I find it to be one of the most useful apps on my phone. I'm planning another trip and Tripit correctly and safely stores my itinerary. Love it. | Super helpful and easy to use. Everything in one place, straight from your mails, no need to do much. | so easy to use and a great, clear itinerary display | very good tool to manage trips and hwt regular updates | trip it keep all the travel and hotels together. Very practical. | Tripit Pro is the best way to get organized and then stay dynamically organized as your trip progresses. | I have used TripIt for multiple trips, and I appreciate how it keeps us on track with our schedule. I also like that I can share the itenary with others. I would, however, like to see both a start and end time on the main page. | it's a great traveling tool. | Fun to track it all. | Doesn't connect to email like it used to. Harder to use. Used to so smooth and seemless, not anymore. | I love having all of my reservations in one place with addresses, reservation numbers, contact info and anything I could need while traveling. I can also share the itinerary with people that are traveling with me. | Have used and loved it for years. In 2024 the airport maps no longer display but give an error message saying there is a bug. Very inconvenient. Deducted a star. | great app!!! very useful to organize your trip!!!!! | For hotels during the trip, the timeline view only shows the start and end day of the accommodation. We need to show our colleagues ""where to stay"" each day after a busy day full of events. This was requested since 2016 and still not considered in a so called ""trip planner"" app. Any project planner like MS planner, Trello can easily duplicate the element and distribute them on each day as a column. Optionally, a packing list should be made available as a trip planner | Very useful information in one place. | great app | Useless, unless you pay for a subscription | Does the basics and allows to better organize a trip for easier visualisation, but could use some improvements. - Interface is OK but not great. It can be a bit confusing to use at first. - Does not allow to share trips with friends for reasons unclear that even support can't say. - I considered the pro version but I can't really understand what the benefits are apart from flight notifications, which I already get with my airline app for free. | Excellent app | Won't sync with outlook | Great, except the incorrect time display | Unable to create account. Keep getting ""use a strong password"" message when my password is 14 characters long with upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Frustrating. | Love how it organises everything for you. | I use Tripit for ongoing and complex trips lasting 6 months and more. It is a really good tool for identifying errors in my booking process. | it keeps surprising with features that pop up that I really appreciate | loving the simplicity and organization | so helpful | Can't connect to travel partners. Entering account information for car rental accounts, hotel accounts, and airline miles accounts is useless. TripIt doesn't effectively sync with any of them to pull current rewards information. | only with limited photos to upload | Really great way to keep all dates and bookings in one place and to share with multiple group members. | This app is awesome! It keeps all of my itinerary in one place. It even gives a safety score for where you're staying. Perfect job | Regularly logs you out and hangs when doing offline syncing so had to uninstall it as of March 2024 | Where has this been all my life??? | just downloaded. just what I was looking for | Invaluable tool for any traveler. | wowwwww, its a powerful tool 😎 | The app will not let me sign in. It's tells me my password isn't valid. But I can log in on a browser with that password so clearly it is the right password. This is insane. | I have been using for years. very convenient to have your flights, hotels, trips etc all in one place. | The best travel management app I've ever used had only one issue (processing non English bookings). Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred... What if this happened during trip? Useless app.... Uninstalled... Resolved previous issues. Apparently my device was updating apps at the time and a glitch occurred when I tried to log in to TripIt. After updates completed, I was able to change my password and update my trip information. Apologies to team TripIt. | Amazing app | I love how it creates your trip schedule so easily! | easy to organize complete trips | Great app to plan your trip. Gets updated from your email confirmations automatically so you have all your trip info in one place | Love how helpful status updates are! Best travel planner! | will let know once | great way to keep all of your travel information in one place. | awesome travel organizer | I think this is a scam it asks you for your date of birth and where U live straight away and it barely made any plans for me I had to do it myself and you have too pay $80 a year | I really love having this app. It helped me plan my recent trip to Canada. I haven't had to pay anything to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential. If you could export to a cvs or cvv for spreadsheet that would be amazing | New version won't let me sign in. | Very helpful while travelling , and you have a busy schedule | ever since giogle stopped trips, I have been lost. trip-it saved me | Lets have an app scan your entire mailbox for 'just your travel data' aha ... Because that's bound to end well, with the inevitable data breach... | Works well. Easy to use. | excellent | ❤️ | Doesn't work at all anymore. Can't even login, keeps giving me an error | great | Must improved since last I rated it two stars in 2017. It however has slipped again. My properly imported rental car plans always randomly change between filed and unfiled. This makes things difficult when using the widgets | Too many bugs | Great for documenting your confirmations for airline, car rentals, dinner reservations, but not for planning a trip. I was hoping this app would replace Roadtrippers for me. | used it once before and found it again. worth the money for the pro version | Love the fact that you can make a very detailed itinarary with a visual timeline that makes it easy to keep track of everything. | THE BEST travel organiser app. | Best app 👌 | Everything I book or event attended is added to Tripit for future reference. | Very helpful in keeping track of everything on a trip in terms of flight status and hotel confirmation. I've been using it for years and never had any problems. | Impressive but not perfect. Need to add feature of more than one email address because not all my travel info goes to the same email address. | The app has been great but just stopped working. When I try to log in it just says access denied | great product keeping all travel details together | No search function (iOS has it). Flighty level details would be nice. They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world 🌎 and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers. | Hello. I can't invite participants via email. A message appears that the requested email cannot be attached at this time. The point is that there are emails with which there is no problem and there are those that do. I did a few tries and it seems to be completely random. There was an attempt with two emails that managed to connect and the second time, with the same two emails, I couldn't. How can it be fixed? | Excellent! | make my travel easier | The pro version is a must for frequent travelers - it makes your travel logistics much smoother! Basic things like letting you know gates changes to baggage pickup carousel numbers before airlines / FIDs can. Subscription cost paid for it self for me when it alerted me when a cheaper rate rate on same flight came up, with clear instructions on how to secure. It worked and saved me hundreds for our family vacation! Update: now saved my thousands over the years with the Fare Tracket! | Good yahha | Great . | it's very easy to use and links easily to trips. but I can't seem to set custom picture for trips which isn't great. I tried following their directions but it still doesn't work. | Keeps on signing me out and then having to reset my password and won't let me sign in on more than one device which is a pity as the app looks good | love it!! | Extremely helpful | The application is excellent, but unfortunately, I have encountered a technical issue where it repeatedly crashes. | The app will not let me log in. I Created a password but the app freezes when I tap the submit button. | App was recently updated and google login no longer works in app (does in website). | cool travel 🧳 app | Useless | such a great app. we travel a lot and it's indispensible | My flight on American Airlines was delayed twice and AA rebooked me on a different connection, but TripIt Pro never updated my itinerary, even many hours later. | Live & die by this app for travel, domestic & international. I've been using the app for over a decade. | does has list of all the cities and station in India | Very useful for trip planning!!! | Could be better | Love this app, mad glitchy though. Only thing is, when you share the itinerary with someone's email some details are left out. And they can only get an updated list of plans if you resend it via email or download the app. | Upgraded to the newest version and my past & future trips that were in the system have all disappeared. Have had multiple issues logging in from the mobile app, it opens the login into a browser then doesn't connect after entering all login info. | Crashes and does not save the IT I was trying to add. | Verry bad | 1-2024, keep getting denied access from phone and laptop. 11-2022 Not saving any itineraries correctly and supper buggy; keeps crashing. When it works it's great 👍 | I have two long trips coming up, each involving a couple of train journeys and a couple of ferries. It got the dates right for one of them, and was off by a year for the other. It didn't pick the ferries up at all, and only found one of the train journeys. I'll stick with paper printouts. | For some reason, the app does not open and does not load once I enter my username and password; I can only use it on the website not on the app ; I have a Xiaomi 12 Pro. | App crahsing | I'm unable to sign into the app. I can sign into the desktop version. however, when I try signing in via the app it says ""an unexpected error has occured"". | Super helpful. | Horrible customer service!!! (or lack of) have deleted it after three emails with tech issues and no one getting back | Very handy app, the import function via email works well. Would be good if you could show a trip as cancelled status but leave it in the list so you can keep the details for future reference. | a great way to organize your trips. super easy to use and convenient | excellent app for keeping itineraries, tickets, bookings ect. | I love how easy it is to find all my travel info. Trip it not only automatically pulls the relevant info, but it also organizes my trip into an itinerary. My husband and I both use the app, and since he travels for work a lot, he can just forward info, and it gets organized by TripIt, and I can access it if necessary. | Don't waste your time with this one. It's a pay yearly at a very high price. Save the the money for your trip, there are better apps out there. | best travel app ever | very convenient aop! | Lousy app | Can't install nor update in Japan | Keeps crushing on a galaxy s22 ultra. On Huawei 30 pro works and I like it | This app has been very helpful in keeping track of my travel plans. I've only used the free version so far but will probably upgrade in the future | going to be using it on upcoming family vacation. Used it for a mini vacation and I never lost track of our plans and tickets or even confirmation numbers. I need more reference to give it any higher or lower of a review. | Free and works reasonably well. But too many trips are not automatically uploaded and I need to do it manually (even from main travel agencies like Expedia). 3 stars because it's free, otherwise it would be a 2. | I've used Tripit for years, mostly because there was no alternative. (1) It looks like with Tripit Pro you must have auto renewal -- no way to remove credit card so you must manually close Pro account. (2) No ability to add expense items during trip.

If planning a summer trip during winter months. Winter closers will led to poor decision making because winter closers are used during summer planning. Also needs a daily distance calculation on the map to figure how far you can go on a day run. Have to use Google maps to check runs and figure distances. Won't renew because it can't be trusted. | Plenty of benefits to use on this app, highly recommend the premium version. | I installed, then checked restaurants around my local area only to find the list to be way outdated with many on the list closed down years ago. I can't rely on an app that doesn't keep its info up to date and relevant, so I immediately uninstalled it. | Do not waste your money on the worthless app it does nothing that Google maps doesn't do except it sucks and cannot even find state parks | Greed. I paid $36 back in February 2024 and I opened up the app and discover I no longer have access to almost all my planned trips. They require I spend even more money to unlock them. So to get everything I had for like the past three years again I need to pay $60. I just use Google and PowerPoint to plan my trips. Very disappointed. | Great planning guides with accurate and safe routes for our camper | Bought the upgrade but can't even sign into the app. No pop up telling me the issue - just a blip then nothing. | Was a good app till they changed the payment system I had trips loaded they are now all of a sudden locked and now they tell me I have to pay more money to access those trips | This app has helped me easily plan car trips to see family without having to cross between numerous other applications. They've integrated so much into one that it's a breeze for me to map out a plan with overnight stays. | Love the app but asking way too much money. A pro membership is middle of the road, only gets you 5 trips, and is $50 a year. The basic option gets you nothing. Hate that apps are so greedy. Apparently being a loyal customer for years means nothing. Absolutely ridiculous. Not only are you asking for more money but you blocked my access to trips I already have planned. | Use this because I have the Campendium package. I use it for planning only, still do Google for each days run. Like being able to look up attractions along our route. | Terrible app, don't waste your money. I have the premium version and it's utterly worthless. The route optimization is completely broken, causing the route to double back hundreds of miles to certain stops, literally take you in circles when you could reach each of the destinations in a fraction of the time, and no amount of manual rearranging fixes it. I wasted hours adjusting everything and eventually gave up. I have no idea how they charge to use the app. It can't do the one thing it should. | Couldn't do anything without making an account. | I did not enjoy this at all. App demanded I sign up, so I did, I tried to look at two things and it said I needed to upgrade. Tried to delete account, followed their support doc, can't delete account. Thanks for the headache. Would not recommend to anyone with a human body or brain. | Trash app. Useless | Helpful ideas! | Doesnt work. What a waste of time | You need to pay for an expensive year long membership to plan anything with more than two stops | Used to be a 5 star app but they've moved eveything that made the app functional behind a paywall. You can no longer see your old trips and can only add 1 stop now. The paid version is also worse than it used to be. Waypoints have gone from 150 to 20 for basic or 50 for pro and you only get 3 saved trips (less than the old free version). The map used to filter well but is now clogged with unrelated adds(ex. Hotels show up when you are looking for sites or attractions) | I found the desktop experience really helpful to plan a roadtrip we took. It provided some really interesting things to see along the way. The reason for the 3 stars, however, is the desktop UI could be better. As well, the app version, at least for Android, is really not useful I've found. Despite downloading the maps, it complained about lack of internet connection and so we had to rely on Google Map downloads. | Awesome app! easy to use. Has a lot of excellent features. | Please add dump station search! | Great app. Very useful. I love the map. Easy to plan out a road trip. Not confusing to use. Good information 👍 | I haven't used it yet, however I like that it keeps track of the height of the vehicle. I'm assuming it will show diesel stations, however it would be nice to differentiate diesel #2, B20, and Renewable 99%. Our manufacturer says avoid B20 and never R99. | Used to let you do a few pins on the map now it's fewer with free. Almost non existent. I don't travel enough to pay for the app/site. | Still needs work. I don't like the inability of the map point automatically to center on the camp I select on the left panel. | So I put hours of my time in to planning a trip this spring only to have them lock my trip because they changed the tiers. They locked the one single trip I was actively working on and want me to pay even more to get access to it. I have all my reservation numbers and notes in this app. Sketchy af and they won't be getting any more of my money. Way to screw over your customers, roadtrippers! | This app sucks n it's very hard to use | I like the service but the app keeps crashing and since unusable. I guess I'll have to cancel during my free trial. Darn | Live the mapping and all of the sights that are not on everyone's radar | Wouldn't let me create an account | Crashes on road | Dated interface. There's no apparent curation of opportunities that are suggested for your roadtrip. Expensive subscription still comes with ads, no premium features, and a limit of 3 plans and 20 stops. My request for a refund or prorated cancellation was denied. | Invaluable summer of 2021 - 8 day 2500 mile trip beautifully planned and organized in advance, changed in real time with Roadtrippers. Things wewe so familiar - because I'd already been there many times - virtually. My perfect tool! 2024 update - Upgraded. WORTH IT! DO IT! App is priceless now. When you search for locations, you may need to try slightly different search before it finds it - minor inconvenience | At first, a reasonable number of trips/stops were free minus advanced features. Then that limit was trapped behind the subscription, locking you out of trips you had already made. Then that subscription costs more _and_ gets more limited, so you have to pay for the next tier just to maintain what you've had. ""Free"" accounts are not really useable now (1 destination with 1 stop). And more and more POI are out of date or just have incorrect locations. Avoid this service. | Would really like to subscribe but current version will not let me. | Can't do anything without an account. Useless. | This is my go-to before leaving for trips! | Can't get it to work | I cancelled prior to my free trial being over and yet I was still charged a ridiculous expensive fee for what this app is. I emailed customer support and was told I was now the proud owner of a year long premium subscription that I don't want and there is nothing that can be done ""per contract"". If you're looking for a travel app stick to Google maps or go to Wanderlog. A lot cheaper and not sketchy. | Total scam, Google and tripadvisor are free and do more than this does without a ripoff double digit subscription | So easy to plan routes, see what's worth visiting and check out accommodation. Excellent app for long road trips. | I will not be making my trip until late to the end of April. Should I sign out? Don't want any trouble or problems ✌️ Thank you | I don't spend much time online. So when I downloaded this app and logged in using Facebook and my Facebook was mysteriously hacked the next day.. kind of makes me think the 2 things are related. Also there was a major pay wall to using the app FYI | 👍 app for information | A promising app which is not yet ready for prime time. | Travelling made easier with all the options this app offers. | So far so good. | Would like to unsubsidized from this app but there is no way to do so and our card was just charged for another year. Stop | Useless in Europe. I am at a very busy tourist area but the app shows no shops, restorans or hotels. When I tried to find a grocery by name the app shows only list of US located stores. The app has permission to access my location but it doesn't help | Still no Android Auto support! It is to bad as that would make this a world class app. | Would not let me create log in. | Need paid subscription to do anything other than one location. Why not just use Google maps at that point which is free. | Z×foot 4knu, | I bought the $36 plan, planned a trip, and saved it for when the time comes to officially plan out the trip. NOW, it's saying I have used up my basic plan and won't allow me to review, or edit the trip I started. SCAM! | Love it! | I had a subscription a year ago. Didn't renew because of poor maps. Got a notice that Roadtrippers was updated and better. Don't know what the updates were, but it doesn't matter because of the poor maps. I will be canceling again. If you ever improve your maps, I will come back. Make a map like the old Rand McNally paper maps and I will be back. Your maps have poor contrast between the map background and roads. When I zoom out, seconbary state roads and major county roads dissappear. | I am trying to plan a 2 week road trip around California. There is an area around Big Sur on hwy 1 that is 1.9 miles between parks, both of which are on Hwy1. The app and the desk top are both diverting me and making this a 5 hour trip. It is right in the middle of my trip up the coast making it very hard to accurately plan out. May have to cancel this subscription and find a different app. Overall the app seems user friendly, but, clearly not accurate. I hope they can resolve this issue. | I do a lot of road trips, and this app is great for planning. It will arrange stops in a logical way, but it will also allow me to move them if desired. I love the feature that lets you see the stops on a map, so I can see if a stop is too far of my desired trip route. The app can also give great suggestions for whatever your favorite thing to see on your travels is. I wish it included more hiking trailheads, but I can typically get somewhat close to where I want to go. | Love the way it pops a new waypoint into where it should be along your trip & that you can put in dates. | Campendium is shutting down and we are forced to use this app? It's worthless. No links to the blm sites, no cell coverage information, no reviews at all. | We are taking the kids and my mom on a multi destination vacation out west. I had the route mapped out. Thenstarted looking for all those cheesey touristy quick roadside attraction and photo ops. I was having a very difficult time finding them and then adding them in the right order. We got the pro package. My wife and I can now look and plan things together, and the app pin points them in the right order on our trip! It's a great tool! | Terrible trip planning. Impossible to do everything I thought I signed up for. | Gps kept thinking we were on roads we were not and it just stopped routing when I change routes. | Edit: A good company trying to make the best trip app possible. Not my favorite but you can count on them to resolve problems! | Google maps works much better. This app is severely lacking. | I cannot believe that after paying 39.99 for years I suddenly went to login and was told I need to pay even more to now have access to all of my saved trips and it won't even let me choose which of the three trips I'm now limited to seeing and the ones I need now are locked! The only way to get access to them is to pay more or delete all of the other trips I have planned/put hard work into! Shame on them!! | Great app/service to help us plan road trips, getaways, and vacations. Highly recommend | Fun and Easy to use. | They killed this app. You can't even make a trip anymore without having a paid subscription. Used to be six or seven free waypoints when making a trip, now it's three. What a joke. | Great app for planning adventures | Almost impossible to cancel premium subscription. I have never used this service and they have been charging me for multiple years. App hangs when I click on manage subscription to try to cancel and nobody responds to customer service messages. Beware. | Not android friendly and difficult to cancel membership | Great for RV or car travel. | Doesn't have Thailand in it | $49 a year....don't waste your money! | Even with my subscription that allows 3 trips, I can't access a previous trip. There should also be a setting to prevent the app from changing dates or moving stops around. | I have to pay money to avoid highways on your app are you serious, I only own small displacement motorcycles going on the highway is literally impossible for me lol I hate capitalism with a fiery passion. | App is just okay the problem is when they auto renew your subscription with no notice and even if you try to cancel it on the same day they basically tell you too bad and charge you anyway, but hey, you can still use it. | I downloaded the app and that was the only thing that went right. You can't change the path unless you add a useless waypoint to point you in another direction. You can't add dates to specific waypoints. There is no summary sheet of any of the data you enter on each waypoint and on and on. I wasted 4 hours and he ave deleted the app and WILL NEVER try to use it again. Worst program I've ever encountered in all of my days since cell phones came out! | toooo expensive and I still have to use Google Maps. | Suddenly you go from having a free option, to asking for a minimum $40/mo... which is absolutely insane. | I have used Roadtrippers many times in the past with great success. Changes to the app have made it so much more difficult to use. I keep adding things to my trip on certain days and when I move things the app will shift things to the wrong day. We rent houses so I keep the house address at the end of every day since that is where we return to. The app keeps trying to group the house listings together. Once I put something on a day, it should stay there. | No no no | I had the absolute worst customer service from this company that I've ever had. She was rude, unreasonable, and sending irrelevant ""help"" to my issue by just copying and posting FAQs or giving irrelevant answers. I think I've only had five companies this bad in my lifetime and this goes down as one of the worst of those 5. | I had the TOGO RV app that gave me RV driving time as opposed to car driving time. Since TOGO was no longer available, I received a link to Roadtrippers which doesn't have this feature. It's also very difficult to navigate. | Disappointed. Just doesn't do what it advertises. Canceling free trial subscription. Worse than being a poorly designed app, the interface flaws cause me anger. | I have had a subscription for 5 years or so. We haven't used the app much, but I kept the subscription ""just in case."" This year we are planning a couple of big road trips and thought we would finally use the service we've been paying for all this time. I had started putting together itineraries and getting plans together. Last night I found that my $35 subscription gets me almost nothing and I wasn't informed that it was changing 🤬. I can't access my saved trips from my phone. | Not going to pay 50 bucks for a map. App makers have gotten greedy. 5.00 a month I'd have been All in but not paying a tank of fuel for what I can do myself with a cheap map. Free version includes 3 stops, a 2000 mile trip requires 5 or 6 fuel stops alone not even including motels and rest stops. No monthly option, no thanks! | It's good glad to have it | Amazing tool for Trip planning. I have used it for probably 20 road trips. I like to add many places to visit, and then just switch them off if we aren't in the mood. Keeps a good record of the places we have been. Premium version is well worth the expense. | Not working | I was so disappointed with the new interface. I used the free version of this app in the past and loved finding things along my route to visit while seeing some targeted ads. Most of the features I loved are gone. The current free version is SO hard to even navigate around, I'm just removing the app. I would buy guides for vacations but can't justify a subscription, especially with as bad as it is to use. Sad to see a good product ""improved"" to the point of uselessness. | Edit* deleted the app because it would no longer let me pull it up on the browser. It auto opened the app. Once deleted I could use it on browser again.* After using this for a while: I LOVE roadtripper.... but I'm not a big fan of the app. It's much easier to use on desktop. But since the accounts connect you can do research and set everything up on desktop but have the trip easy to pull up at a moments notice via the app so still worth while. If you're having trouble use it on desktop :) | Subscribed to premium program not easy program to add things to...dates, plan stops prior leaving on trip. I don't think program is worth the $$ Goggle maps is about the same and it is free. | Seemed like user friendly platform, price is way too much for what it is. | Tried it for a bit, but there are too many things behind a paywall (that are free in other apps), and the fee is over $80/year CAD for premium and over $65/year CAD for the cheaper Pro Tier. Basic tier lacks too many features to be useful for me. | Crashes whenever you try to navigate. Product is full of advertisements which is not acceptable for a paid app. Application keeps popping up messages to renew or give a gift to a friend. Product does not include a calendar which is kind of useless considering it's supposed to be a trip planner! | The format never looked as easy as it did on the website. Maybe it was because I had the mobile version and maybe the one on the computer had a better interface. But I did not use this app for more than 5 minutes. | Could be amazing but it just crashes | I like to plan my route on roadtrippers because I can make sure that the route I choose has services that I need and it links me to motels and restaurants along the way. Also it shows me fun things to go see and do as I travel that I wasn't aware of before. I've tried sharing with friends and family to show my progress but they had difficulty accessing my info. So I just update them by email or message. | Found some really cool hidden gems. It is easier to plan out on a desktop than the app though. | Love this app great tool for mapping out your next RV adventure. Makes it easy to find everything you need on the route. | Great app for trip planning and finding things to see along the way. | Poor overall satisfaction with the app. I can get better or just as good for free. I've tried to make it my primary travel app since this app came out many years ago and was one of it's initial users, however I've found that they have pulled almost all the benefits of a free version and forcing you to pay for use. I chose not to follow suit and wound advise the same for others. Find something else as this ship is sinking. | As with all apps and programs a little bit of a learning curve. One thing I really wish it had was mileage rings to help you estimate your next stop. | Thought the app was ok. Just not for me at the moment. Tried to delete the account and despite spending some time cools not find delete option. Any Company that makes deleting an account so difficult is a concern. This experience has dissuaded me from ever trying it. | Planned my tour driving from East Coast completely across Canada to Victoria & Tofino Vancouver Island, the information on the app and storage of info was priceless to the enjoyment and success of my journey in my RV. | Scammed me out of money 👍 terrible app | I have enjoyed using it. It makes planning for trips easier to find ideas on what to do. | Very weak app that continually trys to force you to upgrade | Not a very helpful app. And I tried to cancel my subscription 2 days before the free trial expired but the instructions send you in a loop, no customer service. I tried emailing support twice with no response. No number to call to cancel, and they still then tried to hit my bank account after I sent the emails. | Poor experience and useability. Why would I want to pay for premium if it the free version barely does anything? | Really good search function and filter options. Great for finding camping with facilities. | Shouldn't have to have an account or login just to get directions. The search use to be better also. Deleting from my phone. | Best app for planning a road trip | A roadtrip with only 1 stop? $48/yr to save additional stops? That's ridiculous. The app looked good until I tried to save a second place and was stopped. Also, you need to register an account for the free 1 stop version. For $50 I could just hire a travel agent for 2 hours | Lmao they want like $60 for the most basic features like adding more than 3 things to your trip. This app doesn't do anything you can't do in Google maps. | Not exactly clear when you install and then pay the annual subscription for the Android version, that this only directly integrates with Apple Carplay and not Android Auto / Google Maps (unless you walk through a manual import/export process) Useless in practice for any android user and a total waste of time (setting up your route) and money | Easy to use and provide lots of good references for places to visit and things to do. | Love this app!!! | I'm enjoying planning my cross country trip with Roadtrippers. 11.14.23 I'm adding to my review because I've had 2 more cross country trips. I love this app. It's been a great tool to explore places I'm not familiar with. | Not free. Just charge for the app to start with and quit wasting people's time making accounts. | Was great, free version was limited to 5 stops per trip, but not its 1 trip only, and all other trips I had are inaccessible. I'm guessing not enough people wanted premium. I sure won't now. | I am excited for my son to do a road trip and use RoadTrippers. I love this app. I love being able to add from my phone and the website on our computer. So looking forward to going on our 2nd cross country road trip using this app. | This program isn't very good. Hard to route, not user friendly. | Roadtrippers makes planning a trip fun but it has some serious flaws. The worst is that the coordinates for many of the places don't point to the place's actual location. Although the address is correct, the navigation takes you somewhere else-- sometimes over 50 miles from the actual location. It made it impossible to rely on the indicated route. Other flaws were less serious but still frustrating and made the trip build process much more cumbersome than it should have been. | Used it to plan my trip with the hubby to Gatlinburg TN. Had a blast will definitely use again | Paid my yearly subscription, they locked me out of trips I already went on and trips I already planned because their rates went up. Bad business. | Great experience great product | Excellent resource for planning routes | When I say this thing saved me every family vacation we've ever had, I make sure to find things we can do on the way there and on the way back. It not only provides you with the name of the place but the hours if it's open. Also gas stations along the way so you can plan your route and then you can save everything all together and share with your husband or co-pilot or friend that's going with you. It makes traveling together easy | This app makes it so easy to plan a roadtrip! I love it! | the idea is cool it's outdated and not worth the free version. | Nope. This is so poorly executed that it is like a comedy routine. I opened the app and searched for lodging near me. I found several non-active links, an automobile repair shop, a dog kennel, all listed as places to stay mixed in with legitimate lodging. I deleted the app at that point because if it is this poorly edited, I am not using it for free to attempt to plan a road trip, let alone paying for it. | All locations are pulled from yelp, so many are missing. You can only customize a trip with 3 stops before having to upgrade to premium, and 2 of them are your stopping and starting point. | A great app for starting your travel plan, probably needs more input for Aussie destinations. Sometimes finnicky when adding waypoints specially when using a tablet. Well worth the cost | Excellent and affordable app, I've been using it for years! | Didn't use the app and it ended up billing me. I've had a hard time trying to get a refund. So 1 star until this can be fixed. | Not worth the money, seemingly impossible for me to cancel the membership now. | Awful. Make it impossible to cancel. Canceled twice now and keep getting charged. | Best app I have used for road trips yet. Pland 4 cross country trips with it and still very happy. The only one yet I've used that I've been willing to pay for. I do wish it could be used on android auto. | So far, so good. I used the Good Sam trip router for a long time & was reluctant to give it up. I definitely think Roadtrippers is better!! | Sent me spam and survery solicitations that I explicitly opted out of, respect your users. Uninstalled and requesting a data deletion, clearly can't trust this company with your data. | Definitely the best road trip planning application available for Android or iPhone | Easy to understand and follow | UPDATE: After reinstalled the app works as expected. The ux could be improved for interacting with the app after the initial search. The support team is engaged and actively solving problems. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Useless app suggests stupid way off the route | Great planing app | Makes Road Trips so easy. | Did not help at all! | Can't even get logged in to plus even though I paid for it unless I click forgot password and use the click option from email to reset. | Great tool for planning a road trip! | I am still in the free trial period. We really like the app and its planning capabilities; however we really need it to be compatible with Android Auto. It was not until I had already downloaded it and charted out some test trips that I realized it does not Sync with Android Auto. I have an iPhone for work and it functioned just fine on CarPlay but my personal devices are Android. When active in CP it disrupts my ability to use my Android as hands free. Without AA, I will likely not subscribe. | Very user friendly app for planning and scheduling road trips. They also provide suggestions on attractions to visit on the way. I rely on Roadtrippers for all my long drives. | Allows quick and enjoyable trip planning | 5 stars for the concept, 3 stars for the execution. The app has a variety of bugs that make it very frustrating to use. When you go into map mode, it only shows your trip in numbers, not a named location, making it so you have to toggle between itinerary and map to route your trip in a logical fashion. Specific trip details are unable to be added in spite of a toggle that shows you can. These are just a few bugs, but there are MANY more. Fix the bugs, it would be 5 star app easily! | After several.years of using this app, I will be deleting it. Can't access my past planned trips, can't use it to plan a trip unless I am not going to stop anywhere. Pointless. | Nice app that's what I wanted to do would be nice to be with organize the locations | If you sign up for free trial there is no place to unsubscribe, they don't send email warning but just charge your accounr then refuse to refund your money. The app is worthless on top of it all. | Expected an active map update as you drive like Google maps or garmin. | Does not cover Europe | Not user friendly No close up No weather No directions Ugh | This is our fourth year using this app for our annual two-week motorhome trip and it has been invaluable to us planning the trips months ahead of time and making adjustments on the fly. As we select waypoints and campgrounds it creates our routes and organizes the waypoints in an efficient order. When we need to find campgrounds or free overnight RV parking while driving it makes the process easy. | Still have issues getting most recent notices | 2nd trip and love this app!! | Not totally impressed. Data and reviews outdated. Not comprehensive enough | Really nice app. Had two long road trips this year and this app really helped by estimating the distance and time between each stop and identifying places to stay and visit. | This is not user friendly nor is it very helpful. Even the pd version made difficult to track a trip across the country with several stops. I canceled my subscription and would not recommend it. | We are on a cross country trip and the app has been invaluable helping us to navigate our trip. | Essential for planning long days of yardsaling. Takes all the headache out of planning multi-stop trips. New features like being able to custom name stops and add budget for each stop is awesome. Will be a customer for life. Worth the money. Exactly the app I was lookng for. Makes my life easier. | The app is fine if all you plan is what road to take is safe for your RV. I however, like to plan not only the road but the gas and rest stops. This app only let's you plan the road selection. You have to use another app to plan stops. | Roadtrippers has made planning our trips super fun and easy! | Bad directions. Worthless sites listed. Will unsubscribe. | You have to pay now for this to be useful. They changed from 7 to 3 free way points. Meaning start location, one stop, and end. You cannot see your past trips they are locked unless you pay over $30 a month. I am closing this app because of this. I do not travel that much to pay that amount, and Google doesn't take away my agendas and lock them from view. | Very disappointed in this app. No help on putting in waypoints. Immediate upgrade needed before you plan your first trip. | makes road trip planning a lot simpler by having various options for the trip at your fingertips. | Very good. Traveled 5000 miles without any problems. | Useless without subscription. | Makes planning road trips so much easier... and I also love their maps and the things I find to do along the way that I didn't even know to look for! Game changer! | forced app installation when it's available on normal web is scummy. | Nice to plan trips and see what there is to see along the way. It would be nice to see a diameter around the area to help you find stops with a certain time period-ie.5hrs of driving | Crashed whenever I tried using it, never worked once. Sorry? | Attempted to try the app and it required an account. Annoying, but ok. Tried to log in with Apple and that failed. Ok. Tried to log in with Facebook and that failed to. Ok. I'm not creating yet another account just to try this out. If you're going to offer Apple / Facebook login, maybe make sure they work? | Great tool for taking long road trips. Helps to organize your ride. Lots of information for everything you need. | A must have traveling app for anyone planning a trip. We used it for a 7-week, cross-country, 50-stop trip and it worked so well. | Love sharing and working with my friends to plan a trip we all will enjoy! We can each look at interesting places and activities to do things on our bucket lists! | DONE WITH THIS APP. Long-time user but we are not using any longer. Created a new FREE trip a couple months ago and now I can't access that trip unless I pay to unlock it. We've paid in the past to add way points if we needed. Otherwise RT was free, and to now block my trip that was a free trip, already created? You've lost several customers now. Using the free 7 day trial to screenshot my trip and then we are deleting it. Horrible approach, horrible customer treatment. | I've been using this app for years now to organize my trips before going. | Fantastic App to map out a journey any place you are travelling | Not my type. | Makes vacation much easier to plan and nice to have a record of your trip! | this app is crashing all the time. unusable. | downloaded it. used it for less than 5 minutes. deleted already. wont stop crashing after trying to do a search. | Crash, Crash, Crash | Dang near impossible to cancel service. Still trying to cancel this app. Stay away. | Live road trippers. Wish I could share a trip map and details with one person at no charge, one time. They could only look at it, not make changes. | Not easy to add additional stops. Only three waypoints allowed if not paying. Planning a trip across a couple states? Not if you want this to plot your hotel, gas, and more than one restaurant. Immediately deleted. | Awful updates make you pay for features that used to be free.","{""1"":2149,""2"":509,""3"":335,""4"":953,""5"":4123}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$6.99 - $59.99 per item","10","10","VARY","Roadtrippers","Roadtrippers","support@roadtrippers.com","https://roadtrippers.com","131 E McMicken Ave

Hopefully, they will fix it | I use this app ALL THE TIME! I love it! It helps me explore places, find the best things to do, places to stay and good eats. I can make reservations through the app and message the venues to make sure things are still available. It's user-friendly and I can make decisions based on reviews. It saves time and money when you're in new places. Don't leave home without it. | Pretty good but missing features... Can't rate individual food atmosphere service like you can on the website and also I haven't been able to figure out how to add specific caption to the photos uploaded. | Food is always great, ambience perfect, good venue for private functions. Located at heart of Westland, Nairobi. Nice terrace view... | Just garbage! Tried to search for things to do in Vegas, app literally closed; twice! I cleared cache, and it did it a third time. | Good app for information | Love the app. Going places is now less of a gamble, and you get the opportunity to say a ""well done"", when a place earned it, and to give your feedback to a place when they could improve. I'm sure some businesses will have benefitted greatly from the app. | Use it a lot, especially for restaurants | Amazing | Must have per I viaggiatori | Easy to use and great for information | Excellent as a reference for your trip. | The app is to specific in the end questions and not flexible enough in reviews | Am happy | Love trip advisor. Still loving the app 6 years after I posted the first review. | Good | When we do good things, our life will be more better | Good well been | Used to be good but now negative reviews are allowed to be deleted by the owner so you get to many positive reviews | Good experience | Great to use and good to refer to when deciding on whether one should use a certain service | I have used and love TripAdvisor for many years. One of the best websites to use when traveling!!! | September 12 2023...unstable...cuts out when scrolling | Very good | I never go anywhere new without consulting TripAdvisor | Easy to use and navigate | I love travel | Great for viewing places you are interested in or finding new places to explore | Good App | So easy to complete a review and upload photos | Updated the app. Really wish I hadn't. My Trips have been ruined. I was quite happy planning my trips by days. Who the hell knows what day e.g 18th June is without looking at a calender! | Everything great so far, I may increase rating as as king within the first 5 minutes of opening the app doesn't allow for much user experience | Easy to complete. | Does everything it should and also well. I also enjoy the layout and never had any problems | Wonderful hotel | Lots of options. Details of tours, locations, attractions. Many you can book with TripAdvisor but info is still available otherwise. Reviews are so beneficial and easier to filter. Highly, revommend using. | Easy to use 👍 | Good customer service | Excellent app for tours all over the world 🌎 | Genuine reviews which help decide your trips and hotels. The app should be more user-friendly and provide suggestions based on last searched | Use the app before we book any vacation | Good travel review guide | Nice apps If you want come to Zanzibar don't hesitate to contact me Ibra Taxi Driver Zanzibar 🙏👍 | Absolutely fantastic | Taxi Service 🚖 | Details from locals, immensely helpful | Con l'ultimo aggiornamento la funzionalitá per programmare itinerari di viaggio spalmati su giorni é peggiorata tanto:non c'é più la possibilitá di vedere la mappa coi luoghi filtrati per giorno,non c'é più la possibilitá di vedere la lista dei luoghi non ancora assegnati ad alcun giorno,per aggiungere un luogo ad un giorno devi scorrerti tutta la lista di luoghi inseriti perché il pulsante per aggiungerne di nuovi é stato messo in fondo alla lista,i filtri by category non ha effetti sulla mappa | Vety good | Very nice app for recommendations | Fantastic operation...well done! Enjoyed very much | Good. More filters would make it great. | Good location. Extremely clean and comfortable hotel and rooms. Excellent breakfast. | Very helpful in finding fun things to do | Very helpful and good for advice | Good | Great app | Nic | TripAdvisor is my trusted go-to app when traveling or planning travel. The customer reviews of restaurants and activities are a trusted resource. | I've discovered it's freezes at different places. Sometimes using the A.I, Sometimes not. Doing regular searching | I do not know how I managed before I started using TripAdvisor | This app is so good | The app refuses to go online. Despite every other app working and my internet being fine. Have tried reinstalling it a bunch of times and this has been a problem for months. | Excellent and easy to use. | Why is all the prices coming up pound instead of us dollars. Everything looks interesting but I can't book cause I don't know the correct price | The app is intuitive and easy to navigate. Finding reviews, recommendations, and nearby attractions was a breeze | Decent app. Works ok but a bit clunky | Here you can find what you need Very useful site | I just uploaded some photos and they were initially tiny and subsequently 90 degrees rotated!? | Keeps crashing. On a Huawei mate 20 pro | It was a really good experience using tripadvisor. It was really helpful. It is an app which is worth recommendation 😀 | Such an amazing app , it really helped me for my trip with my family. Give a shot to this app. I enjoyed it. | I had an amazing time with my family on the trip and all thanks to this app. You can give a shot to this app without any second thought. Just go for it | App keeps crashing. Useless | Great app. Bad update. Where is the Map View??? Shoulb be right on the home page.. | Great app. I am using this app from long time. Highly recommended. | A helpful App to find restaurant destinations | Very good and Imformative | Interesting reviews | Great platform for review | I used to use tripadvisor to plan my trip exclusively. But the update in Dec ruined the whole experience. First, the map next to itinerary on the desktop version is too small to be useful. Secondly, trip planning function becomes too painful to use because there is no way to tell which saves have or have not been added to a itierary. Third, why they never build a simple tab that could archive old trips or sort trips alphabetically. | Very best app | The Trip Advisor app works consistently well and is great app experience!The Trip Advisor app is fun to use,is very helpful!Trip Advisor always works like it should! It's always a pleasure to suggest,advise and share information with others that would be helpful.They post info quickly to help others make good,educated choices!The pictures posted always look crisp!

Recomended! | amazing app | Regrettable that this once brilliant app has become increasingly unreliable. Journey times are now fanciful. Routes are no longer the best available, which makes the inability to edit them even more frustrating. I'm using Google maps most of the time now. Not as many features but way more accurate. | good app for Singapore traveling | I trust it to get me to places I don't know and back. Thanks | Since they introduced adverts the app sucks and no longer allows a bus stop lookup. Will find alternatives as their implementation has gone from good to terrible. | Started crashing immediately on pixel 7 | Keeps getting bus times wrong | good | Very accurate and easy to use | very efficient | Very helpful app if you are new in the city and want some help with daily commute and travel. It shows all the live details related to bus and train timings. | Back to 5 stars! | Very useful. I can check travel options in real-time. | Brilliant app, can't fault it 👌 👏 | very detailed and accurate | Great app for geo location | Best app to navigate around big cities. | Super easy to use, highly recommend. | Good app For traveling around London. Simple and clear app | It's like a comfort blanket when in foreign lands. | Easy to use. | very good 👍 | Needs NYC ferry and availability of ebikes | Extremely helpful app. Excellent UI. 5/5 Cannot go wrong. I used citymapper in several cities and have had no problems. | excellent user friendly app interface.journey is pleasent and safe. | Very good app, probably better than Google maps, has many options easy to use and is just very aesthetically pleasing | not clear enough directions 1st time in a new city | Absolutely love it! 💯 | Good | I hate this app. Bad time schedule | Had to drop the rating, app for wear os only works if the app Is already open on your phone, can't map only on your watch (you can with Google maps I tested it), if the citymapper app isn't open on your phone , you can't map a route sadly. Besides the watch issue everything is still fine. | amazing | Fantastic app very helpful | AWESOME APP FOR TRAVELLING WITH PUBLIC TRANSPORT | Best navigation app for public transport I have used. It not only gives you various options to choose from, but also calculates walking time from/to the stops. Also provides real time information about scheduled departures where competitors (Google Maps) do not (e.g. in Vienna) and gives you the best exits & which part of the metro/train to take to be the fastest | wonderful 🙌🏾 | Reliable. | So much better than other apps to get round London. Indispensable | very helfull | buses are free in LA. we'll awesome App. | sure helped riding Phoenix metro | very good app easy to reach place help of app | useful. | Was broken on android 14 but now works perfectly again. Love this app I think it's the best transit app for use in New York. I prefer this to all the competition. | very helpful app | Not bad, relatively reliable for public transit schedules (less so during school breaks when the bus schedule changes but I think this depends on the bus company providing updates). What bothers me most is that at the end of a trip, the app does not close automatically and continues to run in the background, using phone battery. Small thing but annoying. | excellent , easy to navigate NYC using this app | Best app for public transportation navigation, easy to use and offers the best routes. | sometimes it doesn't work | So much better than Google. I have been using it since 2019 that is from my 1st day in Singapore | better than Google maps for transport links | Most used app on my phone. Really useful planning my journey and helps me save alot of time. Bus locator feature is really helpful and super convenient to use 👏 | Excellent. Add more cities. | Very helpful for traveling. | This app is good, however in some cases it isn't as accurate as i'd like it to be when planning trips, but overall this app is useful, i would use it for tracking bus and train times | nice app | Great app so helpful to get around London. | Not accurate for Paris. Suggests RER route, turns out it's via metro... schedules also aren't precise. | Reliable. Great app. Prefer it to Google maps! | This app is excellent. No matter where you are or want to go. Just put it in the description, then you'll get all the routes and journey times. Every update there is an improvement. Forget Google maps, this app is more accurate, precise and easier to use. | This is the best map app out there! Thanks for never steering me wrong! | Found this while planning for a trip to NYC. Very quick and effective. Provides multiple options to get you around. I plan on leaving this on my phone for future use. | Been really great so far when I moved to Ireland and had absolutely no clue where I was going on my own, but today I've been experiencing a lag when I use the app and switch between modes like simple and walk less, maybe it's the ads, I don't know. But it's made it a bit more bothersome to use, and not as fluid anymore. Please look into this, as I love your app otherwise. Thank you for all your hard work and interest. ♥ | city mapper won't open anymore since I updated my android phone!!! I cleared the cache but it still won't open! | Very useful app | Great app. Would love to support it, but your club packages are far too expensive for my usage. | Efficient and very complete, switched from Google maps cause it was having issues and discovered this | Incredible amounts of different options for the route you can take to your destination!! It also includes many more routing options that other navigation apps do not. | Excellent | very helpful app | Not all time | Kinda sux but better than other navigation apps the time is kinda off and the UI is nice but can be confusing sometimes | Wish it had the AI voice to give direction when walking. | amazingly app | very accurate. easy to use. recommend to everyone | good | Doesn't register one of the train lines in Yokohama and is thus useless | decent app for London travel | nice | Why does it give me information in French? I can't change the language! So frustrating! | Better than Google maps in bigger cities when using public transport. Outside of there Waze for driving or Google maps is better. | Absolutely, the best mapper there is! | Great transit app for major cities!! | good | it's a really good app and has clear instructions on how to travel. | Very good | Very useful application | Perfect Bus checker, just what I was looking for | great | its so good and acurate | worls great 😀 | I don't know but when you get out of the app it takes time to update your location. The course of travel is still there but would take time to update where you are. That's needs to be worked on but aside from that, the app is good. | Unreliable. Suggested routes on one day just disappear when re-running the exactly the same search later the same day. | Very good and precised information | very good app | ❤️ | Cannot begin to say how much I love this app. It got me where I needed to go in Edinburgh and London. Will send you notifications. It's amazing | Wonderful app for city commute. Thank you | sometimes gives weird or not helpful routes, but overall really good app for travel in major cities. I use it almost every day | wonderful 😘 many many helpful | The app has a lagtime and drops your trip randomly but every once in a while. I'd estimate 1:5, otherwise it's been perfect and don't forget the slingshot feature it's worth the experience. | I love this app. I've traveled to different cities in Europe and North America, and I have always been able to rely on Citymapper to get me where I am going. Not only that, but the multiple modes of transportation offered and real time updates make traveling public transportation immensely easier. | Best way to get around a city you are unfamiliar with!!!!. You can hardly get lost, even if you are trying!!! It gives realtime updates for NY trains and it is so convenient! I love that it offers options for getting around. I recommend the app regularly. Successful travels for NY & DC so far.... | Very good. would recommend. I love how you can customise the app logo. simple controls, travel made fun. highly accurate location. love it | Good | If you're in the UK don't waste your time if the TfL app use this instead, I've have been using this for a while and in different cities across the UK and other countries. This app works and is unequaled. | can be better hope you improve the app soon. | Excellent | works better than google in london! | This app is impeccable in every way. | Super useful!! I've used it in lnay cities (Such as Montreal and Paris) and it's always been on point. It offers a lot of different options. | good | good app | This used to be a great app but it is not showing me the fastest route anymore in the recommended section... why do i have to cycle trough different icons in order to find the route that takes me to the destination the quickest/on time. Your algorithm is broken! | it's the best app for navigation. Its makes my travel life easy as a international people | Get all the information that I need, and control the travel time & easily reach the destination of my every trip. | Can highly recommend, not let me down when travelling in unfamiliar city's | easy to use and very handy | very good | one of the most usefull app I used since i moved abroad, so helpfull to reach locations on different places | perfect | very helpful and easy to use | Simply the best city navigation map, it makes it so easy to make your way around a big city using public transport and walking. Have used it in Paris, New York, London and Bristol. The functionality is great. Highly recommend. | Always so helpful getting around in big cities!! | good | unbelievably helpful in London | don't leave home without it 😎 | Great app in cities it works. I used the app in DC not long and and it was great. So I thought this app will be great on my recent trip to Bangkok, only to find this app does not work in Bangkok. Super disappointed. | Super helpful navigating buds and subway transit across a new city. The app even provides info on which exits to take from the station and which part of the train to sit in. | The best application | there is no more stops shown in city map from highwaydown to littlehampton so we need to update. | Good app | Neat little app, though I do wish it could show the buses locations in real time if possible. Also the ability to see the arrival time for walking right next to the minutes it takes to walk. | easy to use and give accurate information about your journey | Almost always shows wrong time for buses on TFL | Arrive time not update | The route screen is misleading. London Overground and Elizabeth line are not tube lines. Also, the train departure board is hard to use unlike the tube one - trains should be ideally shown in the same way as tubes and buses. | Best way to navigate New York City | very good app and also so precise | best | I used it in London and I found it extremely useful... | very accurate in its suggestions, especially with bus timings","{""1"":5289,""2"":1416,""3"":4859,""4"":20298,""5"":242357}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $99.99 per item","VARY","Varies with device","VARY","Citymapper Limited","7691438629453514158","support@citymapper.com","http://citymapper.com","Ground Floor

I'm thrilled with knowing that this app's developers are open to suggestion, it inspires confidence that the dev's listen & are eager to help. I'm planning a road trip to a place that only has 60% of roads sealed. I own a hatchback with alloy rims & low profile tyres. I'm keen to avoid unsealed. One of the first questions asked in setting up my profile was what sort of car will be driving☺ | I need a bike/ moped route option | The app is closest to my needs so far, but I can't see what premium gives me. I can't see if I can add stop time in rout planner, can't see if I can amend the time for distance between stops( according to Google mostly should take more than app suggests) I can't see suggested time of arrival to the stops and end destination.. | Have to pay to use anything in the app. | Shuts down before I can enter a destination. | 🙏🙏 | Found this App really handy for planning long family camping trips to check out local attractions and stop overs | make perfect trip planner | Great App, It Helps Me Alot To Organize My Trips. | Thank you very much. It's an excellent application and very helpful | Want to add devices but no option are availible. | Good App | Have to pay for really anything, un installed immediately | After you enter start and stop locations, it simply sends you to Google Maps. Why start with this app, when you can start with the app they send you to? Uninstalled. | Very difficult to use. No attraction details. | I have used this app to plan and in the middle of executing a 54 day cross country road trip. It is worth every penny. | I realize that all road planning apps have features and benefits that are useful. For me, the only feature that would make me use an app other than Google maps is one that allows me to enter vehicle height. Or at a minimum, warns at low height bridges. This does not have that, so not quite sure what the option of selecting that i drive an RV vs a car does. I test it with the Canopener bridge in Durham NC and the route takes me straight through it. | Love this app!! Helps me plan all my trips... Very easy to use.... | No state or national parks in attractions | Delightful! | This app is stupid you have to become a premium member to add make any routes | Useless app. Whenever you try to add a stop, it puts it as the first stop on your trip instead of between your starting point and your destination. | Not what was advertised or in the description. Honestly, google Maps does a better job. I was hoping to be able to mark my spots, find camping, and such by rates, and each time they sent me to Google maps anyway. | love this app! | Allowed 12 trips then payment required. Update- reinstalled on my phone, forgetting that this is useless. Cannot research stops along the way without paying for the app. Might as well use Google maps because this app is absolutely useless!! | great planning app. used for a trip from Colorado to Maine. it was an excellent resource! | good app to plot out a road trip | Much better than ""Cats"" I'll use it again and again. | Brilliant app to help build a trip and see where you've been. Only on the free version so far and planned a 4 week European trip across 9 countries. Love being able to adjust the route then visualise on a tailored map and share that with others. Simple and useful, can't ask for more. | Bs app never used | good platform | So far so good | Good app for planning detailed trips, not that buggy. The only thing that made me move on and find a different app is the insane 40 dollar fee to unlock the basic features of a travel planning app. 40 dollars is not even remotely close to what you get in return. I would pay 5 to 10 dollars for the premium since it doesn't add anything extra or useful to the app, it only unlocks the app from restrictions. The price for premium makes this app only good for short trips, not long ones. | What a stupid APP, I had no intention of paying for any road trip planner APP. That is exactly what you must do if you want something beyond ""Point A to Point B"" I had it uninstalled within 10 minutes of installing. I wouldn't download it, unless you plan to pay anywhere from $1.49-$34.99. (The dollar amounts may be off by $0.50 or $1.00) | Great app | Can't calculate a route between point A and B along a main road. Also when it does manage to plan a route it defaults to major highways and won't take the shortest and most scenic route, there's no way to force it to do so even with avoid tolls and highways off. Most people planning trips in RV's will want the scenic route. | makes planning trips easy, so far it's really good and not glitchy | This app is amazing! I am so glad I found it! | Trying this for an upcoming trip. I will update after my trip. | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | Great app to travel with | Useless, atleast give a full free trial to test it. No point to pay for it to have to get my money back. | Nothing more than you can get on Google maps. A complete waste of money! | Absolutely love this app! As a premium member we were able to continually adjust our route as we had to change our plans due to road closures.. snow..family out of town etc. I just upgraded to lifetime! I'm so excited!! | Potential but limiting features. Hard to explore to find what you might want to see. Example Parks: shows all parks from local to national but not filter or list view if exploring one of their existing routes no way to just at the stops to a route you are already planning for discovery route ability to switch where to start and have it reoder things I miss from other tools How far do you want to drive per day and then suggested stop area. have main route and easy to star ideas around stop | impossible to use. keeps trying to select the wrong place as the start point. Will not be using. | Access | awesome | Do not use to try to plan a road trip, the only feature which is not premium is restaurants. You can't even find gas stations along the route without subscription | Great app, all the features I need without making it overly complicated. However there are two features I'd really appreciate: 1. View the trip on a PC via a website. Even if not all features were available it would be great to be able to see the trip on a bigger screen. 2. Share your starred places along with the trip. Maybe each person has their own list but the option to view other peoples would be great. | O mizerie care îți cere premium (bani) și ca să respiri deasupra ei. Out instant! | Difficult to understand. Once a holiday travel route is planned, unable to discover a way to PRINT a detailed itinerary. No way to contact support from within the app. Removed. | Pretty nice app | Best App Ever, provides me lots of ways to schedule my trips from point A to point B and so on, with stops along the way, love how I can click on my stop and view more info about that area and I can add comments to each stop as well. | Ui is entirely lacking in intuition. Tried like hell to add a generalized stop mid route but you apparently have to plan out in advance because it won't let you rearrange anything. Doesn't show road numbers or even that roads exist unless you're super zoomed in, and good luck finding anything off the highway. | needs to be premium to use functions. limited to only plan two trips in free mode and can't even print them. would be a good app if not so limited. | nice | Navigation is clunky. I want to add stops to my trip but need them in a specific order. The app keeps wanting me to drive hours back past my start and/or location if I use the ""smart insert"" function. There is a section where you can change the order but defeats the purpose of the previously mentioned function. I do like that the free version includes a lot more stops than other apps. | Can plan for 3 days then another one of those bs ""subscriptions"". As soon as I get smashed with buy this buy buy that give us 5 stars carry on in the first five minutes earns the uninstall score and move to the next one. | great App and easy to use. | Would be even better if you could divide long routes into different days | So far so good | Very useful | Easy to use! | My wife & I went around the country on motorcycle (4 corner ride). Imagine trying to do this without some sort of device or app to assist in our travels. This app helped tremendously! We were able to prepare in advance our stops while staying on track with our whole trip plans. It was worth the cost as all other apps would only let us track 10 stops at which point we would have to cancel a stop to add another. Imagine having 45 stops. Thank you for creating the app. | If you know how to use Google maps, then why use this? It relies on Google Maps and you are limited to 30 way points. Why bother with this app? | Hard to change routing | I like this app! It would be nice if I could save multiple trips. | Adds nothing to the planning, doesn't let me see details about the places to stop or anything. I could do this all on Google maps | Wow, I mean WOW!!!!! IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS APP GET IT !!!! If you are looking for an app to plan your trip this is it. I had some Difficulty trying to figure out how to get the app to do what I wanted. Customer Support responded almost immediately. REASONS: 1. Never experienced Customer Support this amazing. 2. Never had a developer bend over backwards to help me get everything I needed. You all are absolute ROCK STARS, Thank you so much for everything. I look forward to ur next app!!! | Very good thank you | Lots of possibilities, even for free! If you're taking a sightseeing trip, make sure to take Roadie :) | Takes too much work to add destinations in the order I want to. Can't edit unless upgraded. | Had businesses not attracions listed. Have major attractions near here such as a six flags park and not even listed let alone sculpture park or state museum. | Its a good app, just a shame the free side of it doesn't allow more access | So far it's looking waaaaay better then the other apps I tried. Fingers crossed 🤞Will give 5 stars if all goes well. Wish I could have just taken all the work I did in Google maps and shared it with this app to make the route. That would have been very cool 😎 Ok I would also like to add that the *smart insert* isn't so smart lol I'm having to correct it almost every time, which is still not a big deal just find it funny. | I have found the app great for travel planning. I haven't used it on the road yet because of travel restrictions but I've been able to plan where to explore when that can be done. I drive an electric vehicle so I like the section distances to check my range and when I need to charge | Enjoying this app - it's easy to use and it's nice seeing our plans come together on the map. Would love it if it was possible to add calendar dates to each stop along the route, since its not just about where you are going but when you will be there. Am doing it manually via the notes. | Love it, wish we could have web version too (work together, app and web) | If you already know where you want to stop, this app seems to be a good way to plan out your trip. It's not great for finding places to stop along a road trip, though (which is what I was looking for), even with the paid version. The ""attractions"" that it lists are mostly retail stores and a few state parks; it doesn't have a lot of museums, sights, etc. I also didn't see an option to search for hotels (though I didn't look very hard). | Very limited, not worth it | This is a pretty cool app. If you could book hotel rooms or campsites through the app I'd hit it with a full 5 stars! | The app isnt free unless you want to only be able to look up restaurants. Sure you can do a week long free trail but that doesn't mean it's free. Unfortunate and disappointing. | BS can't access anything with out paying big bucks | pretty useful app! | All functions reserved for premium version. Gone. | Not a free app. The only thing you can search under the free limit, is your destination and restaurants. Gas, attractions, camping, etc. All cost money to upgrade. Would at least prefer they give a free trial so you KNOW how good the app works. For me, it's not worth the risk. There's enough other individual free apps, and I can just combine my research. | I was looking for such an app for a long time. but got disappointed! Could be a great app if it let people experience its features!!! All features are reserved for premium members and there's no trial. So no way to learn about the app and features unless you pay first. The free acount is literally the Google Map. | great UX!! too bad it ain't free as in libre! 🥺 | Unless you upgrade right away you can't do anything else other than schedule your route. Yes, you can add stops but what's the point if what you want are suggestions to places of where you should stop? Unless you upgrade, it's no different from Google Maps. Disappointed. | So early to expect a review, still figuring out how to use, if to keep using and even upgrade if it rocks. Thanks for the free version. | First impression was that it seems good but there's a huge 40 dollar paywall to purchase forever or u can keep paying a subscription... | want you to subscribe 2 premium to obtain accesses to over 3/4 of features | App was okay, but didn't do much. Not many features. I don't think it would be very useful for a road trip honestly. | Can't do anything except map direct route from point A to point B unless you pay to upgrade. Not even offered a free trial. Absolutely pointless didn't help me at all. Uninstalled with ZERO chance of ever reinstalling it. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOOGLE MAPS DOES IT ALL JUST AS WELL AS ANY OTHER. | Maybe it's me? But, what's the difference in this app vs. Google Maps? Wasn't really impressed. Figured it would have something about top 100 road trip scenic stops or something to help inspire the idea for where the next roadtrip should be. | Overall a very useful app, but missing a few simple things. For instance, a quick way to change between map and satellite views, and a quick way to override dark theme. These are the things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. | Based on the app's description, I was expecting to be able to look up destinations on our route by category versus continually entering addressess. | Fun times in my home state of Utah! | Location permission problems make it impossible to choose current location as start point | Nice interface and comfortable controls. More satisfying trip planning tool than the classical map apps | Have been looking for an app like this for ages, I love it! So handy! Thanks alot | so far very good | Good | Whats the point of the app if it takes you to Google maps anyway?! Google maps does everything this does | Was looking for something like this all over the web. Great route builder /trip planner. Excellent ""Smart insert feature"". Waiting for the lifetime premium subscription to come with discounts. But even free version is more than enough to plan one trip at a time as it's offering a generous 30 stops (thumbs up for this) . Simple and easy to use!!! Keep it is guys. | Planning a road trip to Europe and was going to do a spreadsheet until I came across this app. Its bloomin brilliant and does exactly what is required. Will consider unlocking premium then hopefully I can get my route on my phone as well as my tablet. The only issue I have found upto now is when I add a new stop and it only gives me 3 options. Whilst the smart option works well sometimes it puts it in the wrong place. It would be nice to choose where to put it without needing to drag it after | I love this app its very helpful | Instead of taking the direct route, it seemed to want to add several hundred kilometres to the route by going the longest way possible. I tried adding other stops to the route to change this, but to no avail. | so far so good | very easy to add stops to the route | Junk app | Wow this reminds me of another app but ""prettier"" hmmm what's that called oh yeah Google Maps! Explain to me the benefits and I'll change review. Its just a polished version of Maps and uses Maps API for everything and yet you encourage folks to buy the premium too | Cant save planed route | How wonderfully easy it is to make sightseeing road maps with this app. | love the simplicity of the ap! perfect for what I want! the only thing I would love to see would be a couple of different icons for ""stared"" locations for example a restaurant icon or similar, so that I could see from the map view what is a point of interest, what is a food stop etc. | I love the simplicity! I am just planning my summer road trip and I was looking for an app to save my itinerary and also places around it that I might want to visit spontaneously. The app really helps me to keep track of distances and it's amazing for searching campsites or restaurants along the route. | Such a great app. We were looking for something exactly like that. Very intuitive and simple. We used it in our last roadtrip and loved it! | Its nice app the one was looking for. But when I searched some of the places in chapura ... famous kempagowda fort near Bangalore is not showing up when I searched. The map that s being used is having less place information. need to improve on data. I would be using this app if we cannot find the places I am looking for. May be if this was not a drawback I would purchase it for life time. Good try guys keep up the app. I see the performance s also good. I gave 3 rating for place data missing. | Absolutely great.... until you can't do more than 10 stops. Shame | Downloaded because pic above says ""Add unlimited stops"". The first banner I saw told me that I could only add up to 10 stops without becoming a Premium member. | Easily handling our tour planning for longer and shorter vacations. No matter if around home or abroad. | Such an awesome road trip planner, exactly what I've been looking for! Simple and intuitive to add, remove, and rearrange stops, and you can even flag things that aren't necessarily on the driving route (points of interest, optional side trips, etc.) Love it!","{""1"":144,""2"":0,""3"":91,""4"":186,""5"":907}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $39.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Ori App Studio","7745112439494598904","support@getroadie.app","https://roadietripplanner.com","Eschersheimer Str. 27

I paid the subscription fee,but cannot use the app. I am sending emails asking for help, no respond... I am disappointed... | Put some effort in error handling. | Wish there was a way to add your own place you want to visit. I.e. a theatre or specific address. | Wish I knew if this before. | Scam. They say it's free and even before use it everything is blocked unless you subscribe a plan. | great trip planner app | plans created do not reflect opening/closing times. Can't visit night markets at 0900 hrs, not weekend only markets on weekdays! & some prominent new attractions like IconSiam can't be found & added to app | This is a great app with everything in the one place | Great app that gives you a lot of options for sightseeing in cities around the world. The new feature that allows you to set when the day starts for touring is a welcome capability. I've used this in multiple cities around the world. | Wow, downloaded for our upcoming trip to Oslo and the first thing on all the itineraries is the Viking Ship Museum. Seriously, it's closed UNTIL 2026. That's part of the reason I was looking for an app with suggestions. The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City™ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan. Even after deleting the whole itenary it doesnt refresh the updated itenary. Very bad app experience. Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Job👍 | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing 😍 | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | tốt | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for. | This app/company will add your email address to spam lists with no authorization, so don't use any of the SSO options when you launch it! How trashy. Don't start emailing me your newsletter just because I opened your app one time. | good experience in yelanaka oon bikes the feedback related vehicle are good, the way of approch towards the costumer was brilliant , the vehicle are well maintained with proper fueling in the bike that I have took overall experience was good | Creating new plans and editing existing ones could be easier, but it offers a wonderful service | Really great app for planning a visit somewhere. So many options!!! I just wish I could connect my trip accounts (hotels, flights, etc) for points and discounts. Also, it would be nice to see AAA or military discounts. Excellent app and I'm excited for this application's future! | was this a joke | I can not use the app, appear google notifc. Of loc. And I cant use | Love the website. But the App is not working. Android 12. Just white screen when I open it. | Deeply unimpressed. I had already put together my itinerary of Amsterdam and very few of the places were listed and some were in the wrong place. | ok so far | Happy so far even the app looks like iOS. Probably Flutter tech. I will do 5 stars if I can manage to mark as visited the attractions. | Permission hogger. If I say no to the location permission, it means no. Spamming it, will not change my mind. | Nice app, very easy to create an itinerary and to find great places to visit. Needs some improvement when changing the day within an itinerary. | All the app can give you is paid places tours. Nothing like real travel plans. | For your day tours, couldn't you include (or at least have it as option) a STOP FOR LUNCH??!!....then resuming the tour in the afternoon?? | nice app to use when planning a trip. They show a diverse assortment of activities in each city. I especially like that they have trip planning by day and desired level of activity. 1, 2 or 3 days plans. | Doesn't even work on my new tablet but good on PC or phone! | Great trip planner for international travelers. | Such an amazing tool, don't leave home without it! | Excellent tool for travel | I've used in 10+ cities and it's great for planning day-to-day activities and staying organized, and also finding things to do on the fly. It's really helpful that you can add other plans, like visiting friends, theatre tickets, etc. and find things to do based on your location so they're easy to walk to. My only complaint is when creating plans from a wishlist, it prioritizes location over operating hours - what's the point of getting somewhere efficiently if it's closed when you get there? | perfect app to plan your own tour or get private tours. Very helpful. | Location permission Pop up never goes away. That's so enoying. | All my plans disappeared after opening on the web | Not impressed by this app at all. I was expecting to be able to add sites in the cities I am visiting so I could plan the best route to see everything. Unfortunately, everything in this app was geared toward booking tours. I understand that they need to make money and, if you are looking to book a bunch of tours I'm sure this is great, but this is not what I was looking for. Huge disappointment. | Nice | Formerly useful app. This app allows you to plan a multi-day itinerary in some detail. You can take one of their plans and move attractions around to suit. Just a few small improvements would help: 1) Ten day trip maximum is too short 2) Should allow a fixed time for reservations 3) Should be able to change hotels to allow a multi-city trip UPDATE 2022-08 Sorry to say app and Web now useless as some recent reviews have noted. Zero stars | very helpful app for making effective use of your time in a city | Very helpful app, but a number of glitches and needed features make it a 3 star rating. | Just an app selling overpriced tours. Better to do a little research by your self. | Great app | Great idea - shockingly poor execution It's like first draft. Changes times & days in my plan. Unable to move them back. Can't add ANYTHING that's not on their list. Forced to have events one after another, as if I'm not allowed a break. Very frustrating & unnecessary | Music tour | Great idea, really helpful but UI is not intuitive at all! It's frustrating to use as I can quite add 1 day guides per day, but then it's over writing them. Just really confusing! | it's a good app | Keeps freezing | Exceptional. I downloaded map and managed to use it in offline mode. No need to ask others how to reach places. | I was really enjoying the app, I'm going on a trip in 2 weeks and it really helped me to organise things, I paid for tickets through the app and the money has left my bank and now the app has crashed. What do I do? | the app won't open... otherwise I love the app. please fix it | not working, exactly when i need it, with locally dowloaded data, every page is an error page | Please check after new update..the app is not working...I tried reinstalling many times but no luck...could you help me with that.. | Worthless now that it only works for booking tours | top app, incredibly useful. highly recommended | design your itinerary like a pro | Nice apps | brilliant app. | I used this app all over Italy. it's great! | Great idea! | Expensive and limited activities. Sometimes there are only 6 activities even though the place has more to offer. Other apps are better. | Excellent travel tool! | Tried using the app to plan a trip to Malta. The only plans it comes up with is for Valetta. Pretty disappointed.","{""1"":373,""2"":74,""3"":448,""4"":1718,""5"":15167}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$4.99 - $49.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Visit A City","Visit+A+City","team@visitacity.com","http://www.visitacity.com",,"https://www.visitacity.com/privacy","Visit+A+City","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2RPjnl2F36udTYWeutrdLcu67q8_OjyC4akOyHaN2RVrY2dY2L_gtt04EPP7UL9Npw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vtnEcCq94fAWcilxpK0K5ZADfDqJn7OGC_egYCh_5lT9pJb7x2bViFY9kdT8J-DXjE9m","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D2_XgwZ1SQkYV6Xq3Fm3gxcwF87A2N8z9dOdQtOG6SGEU2pkMksKBBt5QydcF2KRUz0v"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2SENJd17-wP8uZPVhg7eEpLr-4gBct3zFJmzAi-h2mk25lSEWKCowjbS5zvEwfFXkQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a0x2IJJbqjqGuAVFJL8sIqKHhjHMO4Xn6og_GxS5Yp0wEK6VShpwoa1tbdBHt1RZuNQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PhyVZRZI-4yBnVVU2-L1Ql8CI9qeAdimYek9WKDbNrSmv7vcshiUn8ijVtfSoxfDrxU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L9ZEr3UsxS-cDPdHAp4hy3a51y2YjIw9XRlZJIrKFZ8_e0spYDYPEylDA8AprTX6XW8q""]",,,,"Everyone",,false,"Apr 23, 2015",1705430569000,"4.1.59","Visit A City, the ultimate travel companion, just got even better!

Why can't I create my own plan with the things I want to see? Useless app | great | Top place not showing, Cannot add more than city ☠️☠️☠️☠️👩‍❤️‍👩🤮🤮🤮🤮 Wasted money | Imagine sending you for Indian meals every day when you're on a trip to Japan. Fix your bugs. | Family option only shows children under 8. what the hell is this. | I tried to use it on a recent visit to Krakow, but it was just to dependant on the assumption that we had a car, with journeys and hour and half pit of the city and missing many local attractions or locations. | Purchased the pro plan. Now I'm receiving an error every time I open the app. | 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀👻👻 | cheapest app not for any use 😟 | Purchase pro to share plans with my family and it gives an error code and will not share. I deleted all and reinstalled three app, same problem. | Only works with google account, no outlook mail no other. Too bad! | Adult only trip and no interest in museums but app recommended children's museum along with many other museums, not sure why it even has you input your interests. | I'm trying to create a route for hitchhiking from one city to another across India and make a map of my suggested route with suggested sights/activities along the way. there no way to do that, it only lets you explore an individual city within a set time frame. | I can't change the suggested restaurants from an itinerary 😔. | Although the AI part is great, I couldn't create my own travel plan | stupid app | Why go to Japan only to eat in Indian restaurants | That price for one month not worth at all. | Good idea but not for me. | Indian cities not added yet | Needs a lot of work to be useful | Politically Manipulated | Quite off target, only one 1 of 4 days planned. | There is no option for resterant | It makes you drive all over the place. Attractions that are right next to each other are planned on separate days. Bad planner. | Never finishes itinerary | Very poor app. Waste of money | I could have Googled and got better response. | Its not free ,, its not one payment ,, monthly payment almost 4$ | How can you ask fro payment without trying the service?? | Has potential, wasted $6 (not free anymore?). Itinerary keeps driving me around 2 cities that are 1 hour apart: locations 1-3-5 in one and 2-4-6-7 in the other! What a joke! Removal of the attraction doesn't work. Says, it's removed, but it's still there... Suggests to visit places for 2 hours, even though on details it shows the place closes in 25 minutes after arrival. Very poor AI. There are much better apps that are free and more logical. | Didn't help at all, | No food selection choices. Remove activity does not work at all. Useless recommendations that a simple Google search of 'best places to visit' would beat. | Maximum 10 days. Loads of questions before a trip is shown. Requires sign up. Uninstall. | the plan i'm being given is very simple and very minimal, it's taking too much time | Warthless ... poor program .. | Poor app, provides same places, doesn't save the previous configs and selected options, provides activities within activities didn't select. I'm not damn interested about mesumes. | The software now only by pay | doesn't work | good | very useful | The locations and attractions area need to be up to date. | It is very limited and not helpful | Nice app | The app should let the user change the found places or suggest based on feedbacks and other internet resources. It is like the plan is fixed and that's a bit sad! | brilliant app | Not able to generate any result. Time Waste | good | Very limited. I tried to look for information for Honolulu, Hawaii, and no results. | easy to make plans. | I need they tell me where are market clothes, museums, swap market | nice | The two cities I planned to visit are not yet added to the ai list. Useless for me this time. Uninstalling. | No cities or areas available that I would visit | Worst app I ever seen in ages | cool 😎 | no gusto.. no estan algunas coudades. sevilla no esta. | Wow | Place is not available like ujjain India.. | The application only downloads without showing any results | superb | Good idea not all countries added some countries keep loading and it on 100 % no give u any plan sorry I would love this app if it's world wide | few cities | can't plan a road trip with this | not All countries are available | App not ready for a whole bunch of places. It gets stuck at 100% all the time without generating an itinerary.. So far not useful..maybe in a year will be more ready | Frozen doesn't work | I have a Samsung galaxy 23 and when I'm trying to sign up on Google the screen it's frozen and doesn't slide down. Please fix it so I can register. | nice | Bekar apk | The app don't allow me to click on the account i want to chose to log in:( that was weird!! But it works very fine on my tablet:) | Not working | Very limited number of cities ,too many restaurants suggestions more like advertisers . Maybe will improve later on because it looks like a new app but right now not to impressive. | despite eliminating historical sights the app added them! | Necesita información sobre logística de transporte. Y poner los monumentos más importantes de cada ciudad. Las sugerencias de restaurante tienen que ser cerca de donde estas de turista en ese momento, no al otro lado de la ciudad solo para ir a comer caro y ni siquiera comida local. Si tiene varios días en una ciudad como Londres, necesita segmentar por áreas. | alot of bugs and no results if you select 12 day, also i selected luxury but still add for me cafeterias and cheap restaurants and only parks. | Worst app, it do not show nice and famous places | Has so little amount of places... | They have really less citys, most of the world don't exist | Excellent application, take advantage 👏 | Faltu, not updated | super | India places not added | Only showed 1 plan, I tired for other other country then the app gets stuck at 100% | Limited Cities you can plan with this, developer should know there are plenty of other options out there | Never loaded | Busqué 7 ciudades dentro de la plataforma, y resulta que ninguna apareció, mencionandome que esa ciudad no estaba en la lista y que pronto me notificaría cuando estuviera lista. Es súper decepcionante que lancen este tipo de aplicaciones sin tener una lista más amplia acerca de los lugares de interés. | Doesn't work unfortunately. Just shows the screen of uploading plan up to 100% and that's it. | goa is not there | best 💯 | hi iplan, first of all I would say I am in love with your app. it's just a beauty 💟. and my request is kindly post a video about your app on YouTube (how to use)..to all who don't know about your app. | Great app - hangs on 100% ! Go travel yourself! :D | goodness | only 6 cities. not a good app | App is not showing results after it has asked my preference. | loved it | I would like to find more countries like Egypt 🇪🇬 | Not showing Locations from India... | goa | Very less cities included. Not worth | Nice full proof planning | Still ai is stupid , this app is not perfect, this app is also needs improvement.... Uninstalling | Doesn't have the cities I'm interested in. | Not valuable | The plan doesn't follow the instructions | Great app help full | Excellent App | Plz add food option like non veg, veg and pure veg. | it should include Airways fare from nearest airports too | Not telling how much it will cost? And It is also not showing how much the rent will be for staying there. | good work | good | Not a great app yet. There is a lot to improve if we consider iconic places and things to do. Considering AI software available the improvements should be within a day and not waiting for people to use it. | Cool concept, but repeats things a lot if your trip is longer than 2-3 days.. Not much room for modifying restaurant choices or places. You can try removing something, but it might just add it on a different day. At the moment this app is pretty limited with it's suggestions. | Not ready at all. Dont depend on it | Limited to only few cities!! | way too slow. it doesn't respon!!!! | Not enough destinations. | Gujrat is not in Pakistan, please correct that on immediately basis. | Request failed error 500 problem | Kewal mumbai diya hai aur kahi kuch dekhney aur ghoomne ki jageh hi nhai hai kya | This shows out of country.

I hope u include all cities from INDIA 🇮🇳 | Terrible | poor location which in not femous or nothing to see on that places.. | Indian City's are not added... | Very limited cities to choose from. Otherwise its a good app. | Disappointing- tried to look at my home city to see how good it is and kept stalling | Poor and repetitive suggestions | not mutch | so happy 😁😁😁😁😁😁 | Useless application There is no information of Maharashtra or Kerala or Many other destinations.. totally west of time | Places are not added yet.

I need to completely delete the place and add it once again to remove the photo. | Brother Berikanlah Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre | perfect app .. absolutely what I was looking for from a long time | Sometimes the app bug especially if you try to upload a lot of photos in one time. But it is great ! | This is a great app. I loved the concept from the time I clicked on ""download"". Of course there are some functions to be fixed, but I'm sure there's a great potential 🔝 BRAVI :) | Perfect to plan, really happy with it! Nicely done with the tips on all the countries | Best on computer | Great experience! Amazing getting travel inspiration crowdsourced! | So i really like the product... however, i cannot access my previous trips or planned trips without internet... that makes it useless for me on actual trip :/ please built in possibility to access my stuff offline. | It's nice to have an app where I can search for travel inspiration, plan my trips and share my memories, all in one place. In the beginning I found a bit confusing to navigate as it handles a lot of information, but then I got used to it. And it's good to see itineraries from all over the world. | Complicated and very long to use | Great idea - isn't saving my trip plans. Lots of wasted time. | Amazing app to help you get inspired, and to plan your trip. Highly recommended! | Super easy to use and store pics from my vacation. Can't wait to use on my trip next month. | Na první release appka vypadá skvěle. Lehce se ovládá a uživatel snadno najde inspirace pro své cesty. Přidávání cesty je intuitivní a jednoduché a skvěle poskládá cestu pouze z fotek. Plánování vypadá též dobře, itinerář cesty pěkně v kapse. Chtělo by to trošku zapracovat na optimalizaci a doladit zepár chyb ale nijak vážně to zatím neubírá dojmu aplikace. | 🥳 | So happy this app exists! It helps me organize all my travels in my personal online Travel diary (so much better than the paper version haha). Following other travelers is really fun and inspiring too 🌍 Can't wait to try it for trip planning this summer! I must say - every traveler needs this app. It's so nice to keep track of every trip! | Super appka pro plánování dovci. Support | Great App! Simple, intuitive and still it have everything what I need.

Love sharing my trips here with close family and friends. The ability to then create a book using the pictures and descriptions shared here is the best thing ever. Everyone in the family has at least one picture book from a trip tracked on Polarsteps. | Brilliant, helps you remember where you've been and where you are considering going and route planning | Epik 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 | So easy to follow along our friends' travels and to comment etc | Easy to use. Excellent mapping and take pics to see where you have been | World cruise, great to have our photos archived into the right place as we travelled round. Great our friends could see the steps as we travelled and comment on it. We are thinking on having the book. 350 pages but will be a memento of a great experience. The app. Is great glad we were told about it. | 😀 | Easy to use, nice layout | It's an excellent way to rell folk what you did and a reminder for yourself. It's really easy to use | Excellent app for sharing your adventures and photos. There are few minor glitches, the map adds air travel routes when none were taken, easily removed. Highly recommend if you are travelling. | The first time I am following someone, I like it. I'm going to use it on my next trip too. | Great app, a good way of keeping track of our journeys! | Love the app | The one thing that would make this app better is being able to tag other users in steps. It would add a whole new dimension and be a nice way to keep track of people you meet during your travels. | Start using your app, following some friend's travel almost on-time experience! The only problem I'm facing is that most of my followers are French & Spanish...and there is NO choice to have posts translated automatically! This option would save me time translating & sending my travel spots by other means... Another hic...replying direct to a comment is not personalized and looks confusing on the follow-up threads. Well overall good...need some ergonomic updates, so eagerly waiting for it... | Fantastic app to track your travels. Easy to use platform. | Absolutely cool app for travel and staying connected. | We have been an early adopter and really like it for tracking all if our travels. A must have app! | Great App, with accurate location it's only downfall is lack of animation (like Travelboast) once trip is complete | I have logged many trips over several years. Those photo journals are most precious possessions. Easy to use. And the printed books are worth it. | Very great app! Only thing that could improve is connecting 2 phones to 1 account and save drafts online so the other device can edit/add photos without posting them first. | Fanastic way to save memories in a chronological order | Great ap, especially the map | An excellent way of following friends and family on their adventures! | A great little app to record & share your travels. | Fabulous way to flow my friends trip. Now I am keen to use it myself. Easy to follow. | Excellent app, useful to keep family up to date and keep a record of your travels to fondly look back on later | Loving the way I can share my travels with friends and family | Great record of trips with photos and stories that is shareable. | Lovely way to record a journey. Nice features and easy to use, love that you can see on a map where you went. Will use again! | Easy to use . | Great travel app covering all your journey. | S'il y a bien une application à avoir pendant un voyage, c'est celle ci ! 🫶 Nous voyageons partout dans le monde et cette application nous motive à écrire et photographier quotidiennement ! En revanche, les suggestions de voyage ne sont pas suffisamment mises à jour, beaucoup de voyages ne sont plus d'actualité et datent d'il y a plusieurs années... Vous pouvez suivre notre tour du monde en stop ici : MarineSamuelTravel | Excellent 👍 | Great app to keep family and friends posted and also allows you to print your album | excellent app, love it for its functionality and easy use | It has been great at helping me keep connected to my daughter while she is travelling | Pretty good needed a bit more help learning to navigate the app | Enjoyable and for my level of requirement its just brilliant | Love it, easy to use. | Great app, good to see where you've been. | Great travel app. | Great app not only for the journey you are on, but also for recording your holiday retrospectively. | Great to follow friends' holiday | Great to | I like that it has privacy settings and is relatively easy to use. However, it is not always clear for those receiving the trip updates how to access it. | I'm watching my god daughter travelling and loving the updates | But does it have a wiggle effect so I can find ez | Simple, hugely useful and aesthetic | Beautiful app. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. prefer an option to convert a future planned trip to a past trip. It doesn't let you do that manually and only does it on its own when the travel tracker is switched on. If the phone battery ends, nothing can be done. The travel tracker creates its own steps instead of converting my planned steps. Also the past trip doesn't let you add number of nights stayed at a place. It doesnt let you select mode of travel - plane | Brilliant. | Polarsteps let's us record our trips across Europe whilst also allowing friends and families to follow what we are doing. We and our friends and families do love it | Brilliant app | It's a nice way to share travel experiences with friends and family. | Love this app. My family back home had peace of mind while I was travelling and could see everything I was doing! So easy to use as well! | We use since a few months and are very pleased by it. Our friends love to follow our adventures, when they have time and want to. | Great to share experience with family and friends | I love this app... I use it often. | Very nice | Great way to keep up to date with my boyfriend on his 6 month sabbatical. Some super cool, lovely interface features! Excited to start my blog properly soon too! | Daughter uses polar steps and so do I its a good app to see where people are | Great app, really easy to use and its such a nice way to track my travel | Pleasant experience | Fabulous app for recording holidays, sharing with friends and family | A great app to keep a record and pictures of the trips we do. It's easy to use and can be shared with friends as you travel. | Fabulous to track travels and keep photo record and memories of places you have been | Love the app. Works great. Good way to record our trips and share with family. | Great app, very impressed with it | It would be nice if every attached picture might have an own description. It would be also nice if the whole route might be exported into gpx format. And it would be nice if Polarsteps map finds small villages or places too. At the moment it doesn't. | First time of using - Fabulous | Easy to use, fun, works well | Good quality | A 'new' user of Polarsteps. Been great to use...navigate around. | Very good so far | Easy to use. Great way to keep pictorial and journal records of trips | I feel like I'm on the journey too. | Useful for keeping a record of a trip. Helps others to share your adventure. | Great way to follow the adventures of our son | Very difficult to delete, set dates, can't delete steps and try again, stuck in a loop of ""trip overlaps another' that I cant delete. Really user unfriendly, a help page would be great. | Een super app om reisverhalen op te schrijven. Het is een fijne manier om alle vrienden en familieleden op de hoogte te houden. Helaas is het nog niet mogelijk om met twee accounts een gedeelde reis te maken, dat zou een fijne toevoeging zijn. | Génial pour partager ses photos de voyage en temps ( presque) réel ! | Absolutely Fabulous! | Love this app! | Great app, highly recommend | Good tracking app | I am not tech smart, and it was easy enough for me. It guided me on each step of set-up, and let me journal the highlights easily. | Excellent way to track your journey 👌 | Great app, easy to use keeping family and friends updated on your whereabouts. | Used this app to record our 2 year trip across Canada. Great to save memories of where we had been and what we had seen. Also great to share it with friends and family so they could see our adventures. It's a bit spotty when you loose signal and have to put pins in manually but 9 times out of 10 it does a perfect job. | Amazing experience. To be able to track the movements of our travellers was a real gift. | Polarsteps make it very easy to keep track of your trip and is really easy to use. I'm not particularly tech-savvy but figured everything out with no problems. I haven't made a travel book yet, but still value having the trips to look back on in Polarsteps. I also enjoy following my friends and family on their trips, fun to see where they are, and also great to see places for your own future trips. | My favorite travel-app. Tracking works well and reliable, i even could show a hiking route in a remote area. | Brilliant app - tracking, photos and comments. Just what I needed for my cycle journey along the Silk Road. | Good app 👍 | Great app, I used it to track my stops from my Asia trip | Easy to navigate good ti see the maps etc fir more perspective | Great way to document our trips away and share with family and friends. | Love being able to follow our Dutch friends as they travel across America. | Took me a little while to get used to it, but I am enjoying it more and more. My family and friends back home are enjoying it as well. | Fabulous App. It makes recording your journey and letting family and friends know where you are so easy. | Une superbe application pour garder les meilleurs souvenirs de nos voyages point par point 👌 | I really love the simplicity of use and richness of information. Love that there is a map tracker and you can always adjust according to what you want. It's intuitive, practical, clean, interactive. Top! | I found the app excellent, although it took me a day or two to fully get to grips with the way it operates - I guess I was being nervy that I might lose my input. After that it was plain sailing and it all worked perfectly. Feedback from friends and family about daily updates was also very positive. I fully recommend this (and the book we bought) and will certainly use it again future trips. | Love this tracker app really easy to use | great app! Wonderful way to track your vacation fun in one place and not being forced to post it to social media | Love this for tracking our journeys | Very convenient way of documenting your holiday instead of using a travel diary to remember what you did on what day etc. | App loads forever (when internet connection is stable) | Good app | 2nd trip using the app. Very useful for me to keep track of where we are going and where we have been | Great app. Have used it for several trips! | I love to follow my friends and familie travels. | Started a trip across Europe a few weeks ago and the app has enabled family and freinds back home to follow our adventures... and we love the track it makes across the globe. SO easy to use, edit, upload pics and videos.... just BRILLIANT!! | Great tool | i'm already on high accuracy mode but it still gives me long straight lines.. | Great for travelling | Brilliant app! Sharing and tracking works perfectly, and much safer to be able to share with specific family and friends knowing its not visible to the world. Looking forward to seeing how the auto-phkto album works out too. Great app, highly recommended. | Edit: Can you allow travelers to write a description under a picture one by one, someone uploaded a picture from a great restaurant or a great place but i wouldn't know it's details 💔 nevertheless ,i never ever thought i would like travel trackers apps, but this!!!! omg, i am in love now🥹 | Great app to track details of trips | Great App to diarise your travels and add photos to share with family and friends. They produce an album for you at the end of the trip or it's so much easier to produce one yourself. My family use it every trip. | I haven't posted anything but the posts come through well for those I follow. My only criticism would be that the notification is a bit hit and miss! Sometimes I get a notification and other times I don't.... | Love the app as it enables me to relive my voyage one day at a time. | Great | 👍🏼 | Fantastic App. Highly recommend | Love it - easy to use, and helps create a cool story | Love this app😍 | A great way to record your trip.. | Love it! Great usability, simple navigation. | My son is traveling. It's great app for us to see what he is doing. | Easy to use and a great to record your travels. | I love the app and it works great generally. I am documenting a year long journey and i can recommend it! Ome issue ive started to have recently is that it wont log me in and gives me an error. Sometimes its a few days like that before it works again. What causes this? It makes it hard to document my steps at the moment. | Love using this app to see other people's journeys and to diarise ours. Easy to use. | I have loved writing my steps down in this app , can't wait to get my thialand trip printed up in a book too , my only trouble is half my family and friends won't download the app to follow me , but hay ho who cares x | Great application, have been using it and I love it. They should add a feature for when you travel in group, we all want the journey on our profile and we have to duplicate the work. Hope to see that soon, I'll give 5 stars. | The app is great and easy to use. However, pictures and videos load very slowly (especially videos). Videos load slowly for us users and to our shared recipients. Please improve your video load time. | Absolutely fantastic app. I downloaded this app for our 7 and half month Europe campervan adventure. Its tracking our every move and displaying it on a map, exactly what we wanted. You can mark places you've stopped/visited etc and then publish it, which means it's saved. You can also add photos if you wish. Thank you for a fantastic app. | Very cool app, exactly what I was looking for! The only thing it's missing is the ability to have a collaborative trip, where you can add other people to it, and you can all add pictures and notes to the trip! Like a shared album. - that would be next level! | I have already printed four albums from my trips and I am about to order the fifth one. It's really easy to use and it's the perfect way to remember your trips. | Great app to keep a little travelblog for your loved ones back home. It tracks where you've been on the minute. You can add steps every so many minutes, great when you want to add a little sidenote in-between. The post and comment sections work just like any social media platform. Edit: One thing I would have actually liked to see added is the ability to like comments. (i.e. having a (select) option of emoji's to react to comments directly, instead of having to add a comment yourself) | I would give it a 10 stars if I could. Such a good idea, to collect all your travel memories in obe spot | Extreem mooi en handig gemaakte app! Zeer content mee :) | Still learning, but so far, I'm enjoying using this app. | Keeps my wife and I connected to our precious kids as they have fun in Europe. we live vicariously through them in NZ | Been using this for my RTW trip and it's great, a little travel diary, and also so close friends and family can see how the trip is going. | Made keeping track of our trip really easy | Used Polar steps on a previous vacation to Thailand and Vietnam it is an amazing app to chronicle all your travels and offer a book to commemorate all of your adventures in.

Update the app | Works great! | £19.99 a month!!!! Just for an app!!! If you want to add more than 10 stops then this is the price. You can't move the pin flag to precise location either. | excellent app | It works but I just want to make a walking route and don't need it to be optimized. | Drag and drop stops would be great. Once optimised, if users could adjust individual drops by dragging and dropping them into place. Other than that it's a great app | Your app stinks. Put your email in to log into it. Nothing but circle going round and round | Good | Great app to use , makes my work more time efficient and it's free !! | Cannot plan personal route | Let's you type in all the addresses before it tells you its $$$ paid. | Been using this for the last couple of years and love it! Saves me tons of time for my outside sales job. Now, how do I change from monthly plan to the annual 50% for android users? | Could be better but it's good enough value for the money spent. | Good app | Awful | the free portion is worth it. | works really well best one I've used | Not good | Tried Circuit for teams, but it kept freezing my phone. (2 yr old Samsung) so uninstalled and tried just reg Circuit. Worked for a few hours, now the audio doesnt work. May start with the first direction, but thats it. I cant be checking my phone constantly to check the map. Totally frustrating and useless as far as I am concerned. Both Circuit Teams and Circuit dont work on my phone, and they are the ONLY apps I've ever had a problem with. | Very helpful since I didn't I now area or most effective way to set up route | Honestly the best app for driver route optimization. Mostly beneficial for drivers making numerous stops like 10+ stops | Not being able to optimize the route because I'm not there. I need they before going there. | Definitely cool but it wasn't free enough for me. | Dev's don't really care about what we Want. We have been asking for a Way to physically move our address on the map planner because the app likes to do what it wants after a route is finished, and update_re-optimize when the route is started. I drive busses in different locations often, and often times this app likes to put things not in the correct order compared to my route sheet. And when that happens the ""make next stop"" feature isn't helpful at all. You basically have to go back In and redo | App is becoming a big nuisance. Passing stops sending me to last stop on some roads then wants me to work it backwards. 2nd thing is whats the point of sorting route to half town then send me to country side then back in town?? I'm using this app for over 2 years now. Last few months updates messed everything. The way how it should be, add instead first auto and last First, second, third, auto and last stop so areas would be easily organised Definitely doesn't worth 20e anymore | I think it's bs that this is 20 bux a month. It maps out my stuff f'd up all the time. I have to reroute using g maps manually. | awesome app | I find the inability of simply LOCKING THE ROUTE MAP really FRUSTRATING! I see myself creating unwanted stops many times, just because I happened to leave my finger on the map for longer than necessary (quite common when you're pinching/zooming all the time, one must say) - which usually duplicates the same stop 2, 3 times or creates one literally miles away fr where my current route is! & this requires us to have to delete said duplicates + update de route - which obviously makes us WASTE TIME! | Disappointed | Best and easiest app I've found | makes route planning a whole lot more convenient. makes my life easier when doing errands and having to figure out where to go first. a little hard to understand at first but you will eventually figure it out. | Great app and works great only issues I am having is when you have multiple address you cand manually move it up one. Like a drag and drop. Other then that keep up the great work | Not for trip planning only for deliveries tried to plan a trip and would not do what I wanted will not let you put the same address in twice when I'm doing a round trip | This is an AWESOME app! It saves me so much time, and I love how I can tell multiple stops exactly what time I will be there, and that it allows You to allow for how much time You need at each stop. Also, now that You don't have to leave the app for navigation, it is super handy if You are wanting to simultaneously use Google maps to look up other distances. This app is great in every way, and it is definitely worth every penny :) Thank You! :) | This app is too buggy. Taking minutes to load up.. sending me the long way to places. Isn't that what it's supposed to help with? Lol.. I'll give it a run or two more, but I use this for work. So I can't afford too many app malfunctions. Please fix and I'll return my previous rating. Update: DO IT RIGHT.. or why not just decide on something else. Like I am.. lol. I will definitely be trying some other ones. Smh. This is ridiculous! This is about the dumbest GPS I've ever rode with. | mapBox | The app is great and very easy to use. But on my phone that has the latest version of Android (Android 14) and is a Samsung Galaxy 24 Ultra it just freezes. It doesn't respond to touch or let you do anything. Android itself told me that it was not optimized for the latest version of the System. Please fix that | Sux | Keeps losing gps signal even with full bars on phone service | Pay wall past 10 stops | hard to use | Doesn't let to try it, asks for card details instantly. Scam | I'm a Shipt Driver using the paid version of this app for over 2 years. It's helpful in creating faster routes for my deliveries. $20/month is reasonable for what it does. My only gripe is it doesn't have an option for scanning addresses from a screenshot. I love that a ""built in"" GPS navigator was added some time ago. It is better than using Google Maps or Waze separately... However I have one gripe with it. I often work after dark especially during the winter months. It needs dark mode. | Direction can be hit and miss but overall decent app | I'm having trouble getting it optimize. | Won't optimize | this app is amazing for any person who needs to drive between multiple addresses. quick and easy to use. | Nightmare, app stopped working while I had a full load, wouldn't route or optimize route. Tried reinstalling, turned the phone off and on, nothing worked. | Cancel my subscription, x2 days in a row it says i have no internet connection try wifi ... No reason to pay for it if i cant use it. | Incredibly easy to use. I love that you can still use other navigation apps. | How do you charge 20 dollars per month and not have offline maps capability? Pathetic | Great accurate app | Have used for months, various issues but mostly fine until today when I am entirely unable to use the app as no addresses load or show any results. | App doesn't work after security update! | As a new USPS mail carrier that has felt lost on so many days and has struggled to fill my time qouta, this app is saving me! I just snap a picture of each address beginning at each loop I need to walk the mail and this app optimizes it all. Now I save so much time just by spending a few minutes at the beginning of each day before I head out and now I can be back before the sun goes down. I am telling all my coworkers about this app!!! Whoever made this is an angel and deserve all the flowers! | Doesn't work with newest Samsung update for over a month. Freezes phone and needs to be reset. Not worth $20 a month | Used it as a pilot driver for 6 months. Leading the way with millions depending on me having the correct route. Pin drops and incorrect road names. Asking for a refund. I didn't even know it was charging me still. | It is an invaluable tool, especially when house hunting. I'm able to put in all of the homes I want to see, and the app optimizes the route, which is phenomenal!! The only downside is that the addresses don't transfer over to Waze. Otherwise, this is an amazing app | Wonderful apps, I really recommend | good | UPDATE: all the issues I listed in my last review have been solved with this recent update thank you guys. | The newest updates and tweaks have really helped thank you for making this app way better. Used this for my downtown university area had lots of turn around and just miss guided turns and double backs. Seemed very inefficient. | Expencive | ok | Ran me around n circles. A blind monkey coulda done a better job. But Hey... Room 4 improvement 😁 | Oops I didn't need kt | Usama ShO | Improvement is needed, when two points are at the same address, it is not visible that there are two, please make it visible in such cases that several stops are at the same address | Huge help for making an efficient route | Great for me as a pest tech | Great | saved time. I like how you don't have to manually put in the next address. | great app for multi drop ,saved loads of time | Quick, easy, and so helps with ordering your addresses for the fastest, easiest ways to do your deliveries! | Saves me SO much time on the front end planning my workday. Love this | Makes scheduling appointments easy as pie. | Uploading a spreadsheet continues to net poor results. It creates pins and locations not close to the appropriate address. I have tried multiple formats to fix this: only using the name and latitude and longitude, using the address broken out in multiple cells, and using the address together in one cell. None provide error-free experiences. I would appreciate someone reaching out to me for a solution. | Pricy | great app | Bad app...use Google maps instead! Once you input the addresses Circuit Route Planner app transfers you to another app such as Google Maps or Waze....they charge for something you can easily do yourself on another app. for FREE! | awsome | best | excellent | great | brilliant. Cuts down my travel to visit time | I'd give it more but the price is way too high for pro, especially when you can't edit the order of your stops to suit for whatever reason. I would like it to have the option of being able to review each stop and edit any mistakes ie put the entrance point in a different location or show where the goods in entrance is compared to the site entrance to make life easier as Google sometimes shows entrances aa different places and telling you to walk 5-10 mins | EVERYTHING IS GREAT, BUT DONT HAVE HOUSE NUMBER ON SATELLITE MAP. PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN ON THIS APP. | Absolutely love this app, even the free plan. I have been recommending this app to ALL the different delivery drivers I have been working with. I'm gonna keep recommending this app as much as I can. Once I release my freelancer / gig social media platform I'm gonna have this app posted as a much needed app. | Simple to use and worked wonderfully. Made my device freeze up a bit with the transition to Google maps for directions, but was better when I shut all other apps down before using. | I'm a take alot driver and this app saved my job | This app is awesome for route planning. I used it for Meals on Wheels and it made the process very streamlined. | great app | 👌 | all good | I gave this 3 stars for a couple of reasons. 1 being the price £20 a month there is cheaper Route planner cheaper that do the same job. 2 there Is no option of just buying credits if you can't afford the £20 a month. But saying that the app is really good just a few places it couldn't find, I had just use Google maps. But ok | it's a expensive app | THIS APP IS FANTASTIC! Have multiple errands to run? this is for you! I cannot overstate how useful this is! great app! | Payment didn't process for some unknown reason, it has all my card details, but won't let me request payment now so that I can use the app, and there's no way of contacting any sort of support team? | Great app. User friendly and great functions like round trip, make specific place last stop and reverse directions. Streamlines travel with Multiple stops. | Once you reach your stop, you have to open your phone, hit ""delivered,"" choose the next address which redirects you to Google maps to then hit ""directions"" and then ""start."" That isn't very convenient, or quick. If it created a continuous route, it would he way better. | we use this app to create a more efficient route for Amazon flex deliveries. Amazon Flex's app doesn't create an efficient route. There was a glitch where an address was marked in the wrong location and wouldn’t update. Nonetheless, this app saves us a couple of hours. | Spreadaheet upload feature is woefully unpredictable. You can use the Circuit provided template and it will upload fine for a week or 2 and then for no reason will just stop mapping it even though it's literally the template they provide you and after working fine previously. Why pay $30 a month for a delivery app that requires manual address input? A waste of time and money. AVOID. | the app really do save time | After I figured it out it worked great. | best route planning app I have found. | Awful | good app. toll road option would improve the service | A bit clunky on Android, but optimisation is good. After reaching a stop and pressing the 'Delivered' button, the screen shows the results of a web search. You have to manually find the Circuit app to continue the route. There appears to be no way to set default start/end stops without having to plan a route. Annoying if you are in a new area and you want to set up in advance of knowing your delivery stops. App has randomly added dummy stops in between those entered. Happened twice. | it's one of those apps that requires registration to even see the map , also forces you to access location and turn your location on or it won't let you see the map , its useless without monthly subscription which is very expensive. No thanks it's nothing special to risk my privacy for it. | great but expensive | Excellent | Installed it to use for one day and it worked perfectly. But like others have stated I have no use, to be paying $25 a month for the service that I'll maybe use under 10 times a year so an option for a day pass that's at a reasonable price would be excellent. | This used to be a great app, i never needed to check the order before starting to drive, these past few weeks i just can't trust it, it often wants to start from the stop that is the furthest away, or suggest really illogical routes. it's usable if you know the area | fantastic app | Great app, only downside is 20€/month is a bit too much... consider making it like 5€/month | The updates over the months have made Circuit better and better every time. Now with address label scanning on Android I can create my route list even faster. This absolutely saves me even more time and helps me get started on my route earlier. | Exce!enter! | great app! | Excellent for multiple stops | I really like this app for planning routes. It saves lots of time and planning.. it does all the work for you! | Very intelligent | From 3 apps I have tried, this is the worst app for deliveries driver. And the most expensive. And if you dare to cancel your subscription today, they will punish you by not allowing you to the paid version, even if they take your money for a full month. | It's a good route planner though it does occasionally take you down a slower route but it's nowhere near worth 20$/ month! That is robbery and taking advantage of working class people who rely on route planners. It should be a flat fee rather than a monthly subscription. Even with the tax credit it still adds up to so much! | It was a slight learning curve but the app is time saving. | awesome | Couldn't even create my first route, tried but it only let me add one stop, after that all I could try to do was optimize. I couldn't optimize though because it said I needed more stops, I had no way to add them as the button had been removed, even pressed an option to skip optimization but that was a huge fail, it came up with the same message as if I was trying to optimize, ""must add more stops to optimize"". Seriously buggy, straight from the start. It's not what I was led to believe it was. | Best thing ever invented only thing I'd adjust is option for collections Be able to set the time in your route for collections so you route will get to your collection on the time set but also bring you in a way where it isn't affecting your route | This was the worst app I've ever used. They say they will save you an hour, lol they added 1 1/2 to my route. This app was so frustrating and not worth the energy it took to push the button let alone pay $20 per month. I wouldn't use this again if they paid me. No thanks!!! Save yourself heartache and frustration and money and don't use this app. You can do a better job using a old fashion map. You've been warned!!! | Asks ""want to exit navigation"" every time after recent ""update""..... | Happy | I use it almost every day | Excellent | Good app for basic routing, needs an option for times you can't be at certain stops, say if you can't show up between 12pm-2pm, tried making my arrival time after 2pm and end time before 12pm and the app doesn't like that. | I love this App. Just what I needed to save time and effort! Thank you creators! | Really well polished app. Very useful! | The app is pretty good but at the time of writing could use a few updates to make it even better, firstly an option to change a delivery stop to wherever you would like in the order of stops would be great instead of just first last and auto, and support for android auto with the option to use circuits in app navigation and the ability to press delivered or failed on the head unit without touching your phone would be great. Also would prefer a one of payment for the app instead of a subscription | The app is good and really usefull but From last week its running very slow and when you put the address it loads very slow.. its annoying | best but monthly subscription costly. | Awesome app for all route drivers...I just need to find a truck app that works with Circuit... | App isn't compatible with the latest Android update. it keeps causing the system to crash. | I like the scan function, the voice input function, the delivery options. 👌. Would be 5 star if I could figure out how to pick end stop. | it's good but one address is always wrong even tho I've reported to Google, I also think £120 a year is a bit pricey | App seems to be working great so far. Haven't use it in the field yet but please let us change our starting location, if I want to plan the next day I can't because the app only cares about my location as the starting point or let us share the route | nice!! | what an app. I wish it was like 7.99 a month. 19.99 is a bit much | this appointment is pretty good. you have to use some common sense and make some decisions of your own rather than blindly following the directions but I do like the app. | T0yu ssku grill friend herthansadapp land hello u","{""1"":4937,""2"":2781,""3"":3422,""4"":18073,""5"":118036}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$1.49 - $209.99 per item","6.0","6.0","VARY","Circuit Routing Limited","Circuit+Routing+Limited","support@getcircuit.com","http://www.getcircuit.com","2 Grove Avenue, Langdon Hills, Basildon, SS16 6HJ, United Kingdom","https://www.getcircuit.com/privacy.html","Circuit+Routing+Limited","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xNTl0wMMmWmKLzBxKIEiErxHkYmRp_9XKG3TaeE43Ugg6QtWaGycltvvyVnowp2ExBTt","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wXa3Zgq1HDRq2QpquR8vinHAEmVmHkRAMtBr9iJuYwBwqjVdPOZVep3zX-7AxUlojg","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qMNYrdZg5dy7kp_4UimwSYSm3ivHJ9xjVVUttUjNLcX16pyqIaGbl4fhu4m0Y01Gwm1Z"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5m6JOK2hTtly2UpwG1-lox6JGZtywpJKyNLzW-BD3PNJmmkZ6pPKZmYbeiQawZt72Zw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zWMsGT49EyU82pFEZTXpf4bZk_prXCNh_wCegpoFLM2mU5fLKCp_Oo6TA2o5qsIz-c19"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vn3IccMcc9I7vVsEZDc3YZjHJf_tcVVbyVqc3VCXawVssi4P15L3CbAKv8eFFoy8a9t1"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_EL-rJIDpxRI7xGElptLA1tV_LywCc4BDh4pREa9sOigp-iHcnuvkU_eUTj3p2I3VZVA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JtS9FWCN9ACnVeOXRdvuHpX0gZJY29cCIS-oKSJlcXoXgIs933oF8OML66krTAv6YCo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sjJAfj3BQZqrg-YPUFKvSRY27qVKm3kwou7Lqjv3P9f_zOH7nkYnSQytRPUkGFwgcR0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/21puF-j-csUV5PuX_rOvCR49YYFFJWd8OHYWZOYuTsqG3WCYkK62WXEA_w3GGK097hxA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_QIq3-Kf2sR4yAmvSx6r_JKS_FgXxTH3GdFD6-EpQUYuly9aicU8pnY_3ZqodCmY91s"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W-eTS_d66-Bwcv7Jd3l3sCzlKUKHl9ywZ76VQUwHR34GBqdEOfE0uj1sC6uxtRCKmzQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OOICZPHuKy3rLrH8H_qZSJIiJ3UAwzu-0J2RBnxExWiJUlvzonDocvLiBoQL65xfKa0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EUELx8A7xOG6hLdepz41ZhYkxNA2huBrnMivwrlzjhOglB22nvWP4TlX28vse65flg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gA_tzKd0MhbKuDfOhQTs_4gVezHZmL6Foa_b52KbR8BL3ycF1BT15saj4XlPeJf-h5A"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MCDrJTX7w4A28stmFu_imTxvTU84K2UOimgx3SQCinrXa6XAPaGD2aIdiGjyKDFq0Z3g"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qkVLgNcSjeb4lUXYw7vb44aYHSWaZ0MBn9qQ2wGRgnbGS5lcpnpLZN-46FKZUGYvBm4"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OoyU--2pZxivl2Z5D45qo0IezF77RIMld7ouIy6GJO-B0ogFYWqGtVurKkBzRTy9ovI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rI43jOVlLumn6G2A4EbgFWnpHM6ovWxX9O9U6Zw_dr9LcpvbpJ0FMk8QU7xsgdBR"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hrVEG8biDN5O3RNaJ1vyakCh_2J4mWRqPxiMm8IR__6GzGsClV1OnLeGowXRsIB5l48"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DaT971BsB4Xk-qvP71lkM5lg8EoCwXJJhzCybIrQ4IQj5LgC5HKAzvAEtBw-MkavLYfS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nKJZkxHySc9Tm_bwjr-jiyD9uf1sNeMSryWwQ-wHh8tRSEWSj_iF0BORhsiST2Z_Vg6K"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/C5s9WIkLsndZZ5U-_Z7CXzZDO-Ru7FaRTRkVy49vAN30xQXgI9gORxdnveTZj1K4yA""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQfUCc8i8nQ?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wXa3Zgq1HDRq2QpquR8vinHAEmVmHkRAMtBr9iJuYwBwqjVdPOZVep3zX-7AxUlojg",,"Everyone",,false,"Oct 26, 2016",1713348346000,"3.27.4",,"[null]",false,false,false,"com.underwood.route_optimiser","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.underwood.route_optimiser&hl=en&gl=US"

Just enough detail and very well organised. | Excellent tool to help guide you vacation plans! | The app worked out great.

Tried to use the web link. Also did not work. Then my husband tried this. Also failed. And both of us are experienced in using apps. Just in case, I deleted the app. Restarted my phone. reinstalled the app. still did not work. | Great easy to use and all documents are available in one place | It's great everything in one place easy to use | Great product, saves a lot of time and effort.

Most of the time there is an issue with logging in or retrieving your password, you're still able to do it through the web interface, but not in the app. I suspect most of the issues are related to the domain change they had recently. | EXCELLENT travel app and tour companion | Superb...app with all possibilities | So helpful. | I was able to track all the activities and the choir movement daily, and that made me really comfortable knowing where my daughter was every day. | great | Having all the details of the trip in one place is very handy.

Also, signed up for account but won't let me in to see trip. Then if I ask to change password (forgot password) I never receive an email to change it. If I go back to sign up it won't get past the terms and agreements. It then sends me to a completely different page. | Is empty | I have been relying on this app constantly while I've traveled the past two weeks.

I didn't worry about instructions, but created the route I needed quickly, entering stops by voice. Printed the optimized route list and map without problems. | I can't thank you enough, this is what I need to make my sales visits more efficiently :) | Good app. Still gets some addresses wrong though. Please sync accuracy with Google Maps better. | Excellent | Try to view an ad for credits but it says ""no ad was returned due to LACK OF AD INVINTORY""? How? | Good | Very beautiful | Good app | Extremely well designed app and much easier and intuitive to use compared to alternatives I've tried. | Been working great | Love it!! | I love this app how you can pick a color for certain stop but I wish you could make it so you could choose what color you want to do that day I gave it three stars because I have to keep restarting my map | Hands down the best user interface for helping to plan my route for the day. | Extremely helpful! Very easy to use and the itinerary was spot on. | Excellent! Simple and gets done what I need it to get done! | Can't scroll on store notes when editing a template | Good so far | THE APP WAS HORRIBLE!! DOESNT FOLLOW NUMERIC ORDER NOR DOES IT OPTIMIZE THE ROUTE THE MOST LOGIC WAY POSSIBLE. A 3 HOUR ROUTE TOOK ME 9+ HOURS FOLLOWING ITS DIRECTIONS. HAS YOU DRIVING IN CIRCLES AND SO MUCH BACK TRACKING, MAKES YOU WANNA QUIT YOUR JOB!! DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $9.99!! | Great | Good but still understanding it's working.. | Muy buena app | Life saver app. Does what it's supposed to do. | Greay app. Real easy to use. | Very good | Subscription mode is available, but unsubscription is not available , also customer support is tooo bad 0 out of 100 | I love this app I use it everyday for work | Really good very accurate | Awesome, but $10/ month for a subscription is off-putting. Just charge a one time fee and bounce | Only one day at a time | Recomiendo 100 % | Doesn't accept my email address | Me gusta poder organizar mi rutina desde el inicio hasta mi destino, útil para mi trabajo | Been pretty good. Sometimes I have to restart after getting a few stops in. At times the routes are not clear and will take you to dead ends. Over all very helpful with minimal bugs. | Would give 5 stars if estimated route time was more accurate and if when you edit notes on a stop it actually changes the notes. Other than those two things is a very helpful app. The plentiful color codes for stops is very helpful. | Apps good but map not actual | My only complaint is that if you drive the same route every day you have to recreate it every day not just simply set a daily reoccurring route. Otherwise it works pretty good. | Free is best | Excellent | Excelente aplicación para ordenar y programar rutas | Very helpful and reliable app | Waste of money for Ontario. The number of times I put in an address and it either doesn't know what it is or it suggests something in a different province is too frequent. There are better apps than this junk. Do your research. | Very easy-to-use. Eliminates all the guesswork and quickly optimizes your route | Very usefull | Great for planning multiple drops. | Nice one | Sign in required | I really like this app. Most apps you have to have a subscription but not this one. I only need a route planner a couple of times a year, so this works just fine. | I really like the app. I can make my way around the routes by manually reordering the stops. I just encountered a light problem when creating a new route for a school run I had to do. It start taking away credits for each stop I added. As a replacement school bus driver and the salaries we're making, I can afford to pay for the price of the subscription and my employer will not pay/refund our adhesion. other than that it's all good. | Good | Very nice 👍 | New version not supported from Google maps transfer to the router apps. Old version is much appreciated. | It's worth it's salt ! 👍👍👍 | Very nice app. | Awesome | +100puntos | This app just saved my life 😁, it's so easy to use, I can send reports, save time, EVERYTHING! I'm the best doing my job know | Has a lot of great features that I'm enjoying very much I will probably write a more detailed review later however as it stands now I'm really a satisfied customer | I really like this app. But, The new added stops will stay in the top after I manually reordered... :( | Easy to use and effective | Super time saver! | Excellent | So far so good just started using this app so see how well it works | It has been very helpful i | This was an awesome app, but ever since the update I can't buy credits. | good app | Good | Just great, needs a time to get it but it's worth it | If you work in any type of transportation services this is by tfar the most amazing app to have!! | Muito bom | Excelente para mí día a dia | Like this apps, help me plan my route well, still learning more funtion on this apps , will be better if the watch ads to earn credits available. | Perfect app, | Only downloaded it last night and began entering the relevant information. So far I'm very impressed with the things it does and so far appears to do quite well. | Works great 👍 | This is a great app im a school bus driver and i use it in emergency sutuations so i dont get lost | A beauty to work with. | Great app best of all is free to use | DO NOT ""FIX"" ANYTHING I REPEAT DO NOT FIX ANYTHING!! App is dope does what I need it to do for my 40+ week deliveries (13 to 16 a day) with NO PROBLEMS!!! dope app! | Superb | I love the app. However I have sent two questions since downloading and have not recieved a reply. | I've only used the app once so far, and i like the setup. I like how you can color coordinate your stops and enter all the info needed for every stop into the notes. To me, it's simplified pretty well. | Great app!!!! | Very good app | Terrific app does just what I need thankyou. | I really like this app. And I WANT to LOVE it. There's a couple annoying glitches, though. 1) if I start my route using the app, about 1/4 of the time, it gets me MOSTLY there. Like, I type in 1254 Addison st. I might just get Addison St. Or I'll get 1200 - 1300 Addison. 2) it's been freezing my whole map so that I can't see where I'm going without zooming out of the map. Not really safe while driving. | I pick up and drop off people, not packages. I need a way to specify that I can't drop someone off before I've picked them up! Maybe the paid version with time constraints would allow that, but I'm not willing to pay to find out. | The ONLY route optimization app I have found that is user friendly and doesn't cost a fortune! Easy peasy! | I'm very disappointed that I can't create a route between stops, specifically that I want to take. I don't want to take the route that it gives me as my job requires that I do not deviate from my preset route. | Recognizes every address, smart suggestions and great routin optimization. I prefer it to circuit. | I enjoy this app very much. It is easy friendly, it has a lot of options for what I need it to do. 5⭐ | Great app that helped me plan got the job done how can it be anything but 5 stars | Best apps | Aplicativo perfeito, superou minhas expectativas | good apps | Requires paid subscription for most features | Almost perfect... But route times are wayyyy off | Very nice 👌 | Нет подписки на всю жизнь ! | First address I tried to find didn't show up. Not a great start, unable to use if can't find address by company, street or postcode | Uninstalled the app because I could not log in | Very good n nice app | I am routing for a church. It is awesomely easy to use and provides what I need! | What a great app..Residential truck driver so this app has saved me so much time in organizing my changing, daily addresses and optimizing the fastest route. | Good | Really | So far so good | Great ease of use | Very useful app, easy to use. | Works great, but I wish there was an option to go continuous without stopping after 25 stops | Awful | Does what it sY on the tin- no fuss | It's very good it's helping me much more than I expected. Thanks 👍🙏 | This is the best route app 🤌 | Cool Man. | Great!!! | Excellent for new rural school bus driver while learning new route. Love that I can add descriptive notes to stop and also see moving map so can see position on track | Super, me ah ayudado mochisimo!!! | Great for a school bus run for new drivers unfamiliar with the route. | Good for garage sales on the weekend | Will it's a good app, there is 3 major concerne 1. it's not accurate, when I'am at one address and the next is near like 5 house or so away or the street back to it it says I have arrived. 2. When I copy a route it does not copy the notes. I have to manually reright all what I have to deliver at the address copied. 3. You should creat a way when we manually reorder the route to let's say 135 and bring it to 21 for exemple doing it by typing instead of dragging it wit consumes alors of time. | Great | Optimization was not on point. I plugged everything into Maps to get a visual, which this app lacks. I had to tweak our route a bit to truly make it flow. | I love it 😀 | Very good app | Wanted to make a trip list for understanding how to get to some place faster and what transport should I use. Unfortunately it's not possible with this app | Great app to work with | Excellent | Great app for multiple deliveries!! | Soo easy and efficient to use | Good 👍 | Very good app. Thank you so much | Great app and easy to use! | Easy to use and saves time and gas | Nice routing app | Good app to use | Great! Exactly what I need!!! Works like a charm. | Good | It works really well! Thanks for giving free credits. Wish it was free! | Super app | I used to get one free optimization a day, and then it updated to where I never have enough credits to do it. which was fine because I could arrange them myself. now it is 5 credits per stop just to add them to my route. after talking up this app for a year, I am deleting it. super disappointing it turned into a cash grab. | Excellent app | Great app! Very easy to use. Thanks guys, job well done! 😁👍 | Great app. Exlpored SW florida. Picked 20 spots on the map per day, it organizes them in good driving order. Really helped | Very efficient and convenient, also easy to use as for first time users like me | Great | Very useful app | Awesome thanks 😊 p | Very helpful app! | I used to use another routing app that has been discontinued. This app is priced fairly and works well. Definitely recommend. I update this app again to say it's really good. Works well and remains a good value. | Perfect | Muy buena | It works alright but I can't use my favourite navigation app with it | Evertime I use this it show the wrong location making my route out of order. | Good 👍 | Best App helped me A lot ..thank you | Excellent App, highly recommend. | I love it.

Easy to use. User friendly. I have gone through so many delivery apps and have uninstalled ALL of them. Either they are hard to use or they have their hand out for money to get the most out of the app. Will not be uninstalling this one any time soon. | Saves time! | Excellent | I love the application | Excepcional!!!!Muito prático e eficiente com custo justo.Recomendo 100% | Love the app. Just wish I could earn more credits.

I love this app. | Poor address search | Best app | Look easy enough to operate | Excellent | I love this app!!!! | Great app.. Works better than any other app in this category | Gives convenient routes. I use it for work | Excellent app | Me ajudou muito, recomendo | You can use the app to have multiple stops . Great for delivery. | This app has worked well for me, but for the last 2 weeks a certain function has stopped working. When I have completed a delivery, normally I touch the green tick, which sets that drop to DONE and automatically loads the next delivery destination, this function now doesn't work. It loads the Google map page, but not the destination until I click the yellow 'go to' arrow, then it functions OK. These extra steps are really annoying. | I have used this app for about 2 years now. Dumped Road Warrior after they doubled and tripled their prices. This is a accurate and functional app. | Does the job that's all you need.... | Saves time | Excelent app | Super Super | Need to login using gmail..","{""1"":1116,""2"":173,""3"":942,""4"":1315,""5"":15360}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$2.99 - $11.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Routin Inc","8592506524785909696","support@routinapp.com","https://www.routinapp.com","KAZLICESME MAH. 245.SK NO:5 BIRUNI UNIVERSITESI TEKNOPARK - ZEYTINBURNU / ISTANBUL / TURKEY","https://www.routin.com.tr/en/routin/privacy-policy/","8592506524785909696","Maps & Navigation","MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION","[{""name"":""Maps & Navigation"",""id"":""MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kUVHc8uQdLVqfp9gDgFPHKUbqVgFJGCohTB-75fCJOLUik6IujWbvDBALHyeN_2nrA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CD1p6R6ul9T_4A8514jFpCRIuQf9PRKLM8FOB3g8cusM2uisGDe0kBFlC4XvnkwhhNQ","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KZOC43GTt20hi4EHxKz6vFd_4x2i-dWXQ2jMgKW4ekrXK_TlaPfexmQXJtAJK1pfPLaf"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rxIMm656FnULjY1duQGLSoQwBzfabzUTtCBcyBTNYRhhU5l1P2pWc5gAurvIVJvipbM"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/F2yzl0fbC9Dg24GMcKa4ZReECPfxReuTQ9YHR0KcTCKhAkg_iLPFpdDfRN-TPpRlFTWS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/letOSUJMKc9XVIBLEC5o3Bq7gTEAyuTFqevgI_LHrv744OBtowDWKUUTXOp9AbeSqEQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mlYgZPW8Fyr-OSwtGKfOwnvjYv1NG73k2I0GnWUetpYToCumsyIjO-YMxDmfYQOyog8"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3Kert6kDD1CiNdcFnpsOKUemXhHG9m8mlAdCzybBHpWMkYKVEfjJcy8EdhlpMWH4dHU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uZIuY764poSeoKfPPeXEyjl0fQwimZpBfJ3Pd4Me58_QqKgaAM6biQBNRGcA3pRWJqw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IJ6LnSaNDxAO4oFthqJ-JI7BOnqUbxdtSFXCwPQNWcdyMWb0EzfYr2_eV0D6AJDaMYSn"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/6eYpdHKeGoNXg1zIgRZLEZFmrkOciJVqyo3BjNafnUFsMaRFF1DxvTT8TvQu5jra7w"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J7KV9u4iU6WjTjQ_0NL_-Yzr6PneaWnwWP7GREgDLlGC4Ehzj8V00rofaSRXmje6rAsz"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/urn_aEI1H2wZh5Kc_CRUs8OIbOxq3uYsPpwe5IMgmllvz2NzTHbs5X4iOh3G1ZKtRWge"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IUtQGOO7i9XoLTQctUvQw0FOVRpqqJ9iErIdB5Fxrw1vIE5LZJN4wBpfE85unGV9Hfo"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/W8tiF2gnRdJf2p9V2AuVh0Cs0doj3IUn6ExWJJ69LjQf_RzhKLHfXlyqxFNFtQj3tEk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0iYFAS-QVsTxUeIxTlhgy7MOSBvet_qNi2ipTBRQmwyiHigtYbk0lLI_lzWe0qFRvGSV""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,"Jul 24, 2019",1712851133000,"4.2.7","Performance improved<br>Some bugs fixed","[null]",false,false,false,"tr.com.ussal.smartrouteplanner","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tr.com.ussal.smartrouteplanner&hl=en&gl=US"

Otherwise it has the best and most features. | Not user-friendly | very helpful | Use it every day to keep track of my bus route | As route planners go, I expected more. It's helpful that I can import large groups of stops via excel, and I appreciate being able to have multiple stops. But the optimization and navigation components need serious work. As much as I tried to get the optimized, the program had me criss crossing all over the place. And super frustrated with Navigation because if it sees an address (on a private drive for example) it may put you one street over (like the house's backyard). Work needs to be done! | very good! | Easy route set up. Saves all routes for later use | Great app. Definitely more functional than Google maps alone. Using the free version I was pretty much able to map my delivery routes with ease and in the most efficient manner. Really no bad things to say about Zeo. Highly recommend. | This is by far one of the best mapping apps I have ever used it is very easy to use and gives you the option of editing your trips to map things out the way you want | I really enjoy this app. It's free for 10 stops or less which is a great. I would like to have the feature to stop a route and pick it back up the following day recomputing my home addresses as the start and end. Other than that I'm pretty satisfied! Thanks. | Great app so far... Still learning how to use it. | It doesn't give you complete instructions has to be explicit that's why I'm getting one star | Give this app 5 stars now that stop duration hasbeen fixed, one of the best route planner apps I have found | This app is hands down the best route planning app for a courier/delivery route driver that I have found. The only issue I am having is that the barcode scanner is pretty slow and buggy. | Works great. | good | route shown or directed wrong | Excellent app | All got fixed. Everything is working as before! Thanks. Update. Satisfaction didn't last... opened my manually added route (which i used before several times with no issues) for the day and found out that my stops are all over, but definitely not in the order, I added them. After the update, it is just hit and miss every morning when I open the app. I never know if my day is going to be smooth or a screw up. Today is definitely a screw up! | gets the job done no complaints | cool. smooth and reliable. clean and somewhat easy to navigate the app. I guess because there are so many options | So far its been great. Gets me to all my stops | noice | Excellent routing app | Wow! This app is great for couriers who have driving routes with multiple stops. I really love that the free version surprisingly has NO ADS! You will be limited to enter up to 12 stops in a route. And you can add as many routes as you want. If you need more stops in your route, then you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Bravo to the developers of this app! | You know I think what I like about it the most is number one it's better than circuit and number two it allows you more than 10 addresses without the need for a premium membership. I also think it transitions well with Google Maps and the communication between both is really easy my motorcycle uses Android play and it works flawlessly with this app during deliveries. | ok baik.. tp kena subscription premium punya | super | An excellent App that takes away your stress of navigation. Best ever multi-stop-over program | I deliver newspapers and drive about 200 miles 7 nights a week...Zeo has made it so much easier and made my route a little shorter!! | At first I thought this was a very pricey app, since I don't always have more than 10 stops to do daily but then I saw that you can purchase a weekly plan which was a huge game changer. I love that it saves the history of the route in case you need to dispute any settlements. And I like that it allows you to move a destination around if you have to. | it's not worth the money it charges can't find certain addresses most of the time the GPS is either rlagging or none functional can't have a phonecall using the app with or without Bluetooth connection because the app bugs out if you have to skip multiple stops you have to switch between apps and constantly scroll up and down to find the stop you want because it always takes you back to the first stop on your list I could go on but it really isn't worth it | wouldn't go yard sailing without it. | It's great | Upping my rating to 4 stars. Not the most intuitive app in the world but the OCR capabilities are nothing short of amazing. I have a pdf of all of our ballot retrieval routes, a spreadsheet of names and addresses. I simply take a screenshot of the portion I'm driving. Zeo inputs that picture and in seconds I have a 15 stop route to drive with zero editing necessary. The unintuitive: you have to press a button labled ""crop"" to start the OCR. Go figure. Manual construction of routes? Frustrating. | Requires intrusive and unnecessary permissions. | Great app! | Great app for planning pub crawls. Dev, confirmed walking / cycling route preferences can be set. Allows more stops than just using the Google maps route planning. | I've been using Zeo for about a year. At first I thought it was great. But the last two routes I set took me way out of the way. I could see the entrance to the community and continued past for 3 mile. When going into gated communities it has sent me to the the resident entrance rather than the guest entrance. And no matter how I try to correct it, it wouldn't allow me to. It also directed me to leave leave a community with multiple stops in it only to have me come back two stops later. | Good for deliveries. | This app is a rip off, I'm already paying for service and your trying to make me pay more. | Great app. I love the ability to take a picture of my stops and have it auto populate on the route. My only request would be the ability to set an end time and destination and have the app let you know at what stop you should head back to make that deadline | easy and helpfull | good | Good App for my specific needs. No glitches, no freeze ups and very intuitive. Have recommended to friends. | I'm a package delivery driver and I use this app every day. I would hate to work without it. The route optimization feature is a powerful tool. This app works seamlessly with your chosen navigation app. It has a floating window that shows the address, your notes, and some controls so there is no need to switch back to the Zeo app once you get started. When you're done with a stop, hit the success button and the apps will update so you're ready to drive to your next stop. | The app works good on small routes. However the app does not route big routes accurately. The app would be great if it could route big routes in order without messing up. say you have stop 102,103,and 104. The app will put 101 between 102 and 103. it throws it all off. If they would fix the routing this could probably be the best route planner out there. If you fix the routing for big routes then I would want to give the app a 10 out of 5 stars. | Signed up but still getting advertised mess to upgrade and can't see my future stops. | Sign in required | Good | Its not working! Very buggy | EDIT: 0⭐ It just barely is worth paying for on the simple fact that there's no other substitute at present. There's no menu UI problems and strange decisions that it boggles the mind, from not being able to confirm exit when saving a route to not h being able to turn off the close to parameter message, to it not being able to handle more than 100 stops without crashing other apps on your phone even on flagships, to the many UI issues it has on Android 13 and 14... It does it's job, but barely | Great route planning app for our needs (only a few drivers and multiple drops). Only thing I would like to see improve really would be the accuracy of finding houses with names rather than numbers (but that is more a Googke Maps issue) and the ability to change the Lat/Long or better to move the dropped pin when I determine that the found location is incorrect. I did manage to do this, but only by exporting the route, editing it in Excel and reimporting it. Apart from that, it's a great app! | I like that it duplicates routes in the correct order, and you can drag and drop stops to arrange them for minor changes. The navigation sucks compared to other apps. The ""optimization"" option makes you backtrack and go miles off route to get where you're going. No option to automatically slot added stops into an already created route, other than the crummy optimization that reorders the whole route. I tried it over Circuit for the route duplication option, but it's not worth keeping this app. | Excellent | I use this app for package delivery. I have too many issues with it. However, I find that the latest update has caused some napping issues for addresses. It's not the end of the world because I always check it before I start my day | Wouldn't be without this app!! The multi stop is great, hasn't let me down yet and I've been using it for 18mth now, I use it along side Waze. | I enjoy the app because you can actually add more than 15 routes. Also that it is a free app to use. | This app helps and is worth cost if you travel often long trips. | I only deliver parcels as overtime as I work in the warehouse without this app I would struggle to. Does all the work for you | Very helpfull for service techs to plan their day. We use the app toschedule service and part pick up on the same route. Ot hives as quick access to all the tracking numbers and estimate eta's for all stops. | At the beginning I found the app to be very easy to use. Literally had only taken me 5 minutes to get the hang of it. Have been using it for months now! Used a different app previously which was far more expensive and not as good. The app itself in regards to the right geos is very accurate. Very rarely does it take me to a wrong address. Love the app and will continue to use it daily for work. Many thanks 😊 | I love the app. It's been a great time saver for me and I can keep records of my stops. It's user-friendly and easy to navigate. | Great app straight to the point and easy to use | Flawless,effortless and easy to use. Gotta say its the only app I use for navigation,hands down better than Google maps,so many option to make routing jobs easy. Been using it now for 7months everyday for work. Love it | Zeo has been an absolute necessary tool for my deliveries. There's no way I could ever set up a route and go to the places that Zeo helps me get to. The only cons I've seen are in its prediction of time. That doesn't account for trains, wrecks, construction etc. and because of that the hours that I put in looks like mine aren't true. That would be great if that was more accurate. | Cannot scan bar codes for addresses does not work like it says. | I've been using Zeo Fast for my business over 2yrs now. It's hands down the best app for doing any sort of mulit stop routes, weather in town, out of town, or state to state Zeo got you covered. Also there customer service is top-notch with their response time and understanding your needs. | Love this app. It has saved me a lot of money in gas and time on the road.... | Im using this aap for 3 years and this is the best route planner and can direct connect to google map or waze.i tried few other apps too but never feel comfortable with them and didnt use more than a day.but zeo is best easy and accurate.thumbs up for Zeo makes my life easy at work👍. | Good app worth trying out if in locations where phone service is decent. I deliver parcels in an extremely rural area, so sometimes I may not have service and the app doesn't help, but when you do have service it's on point and allows you to notate information concerning the trip/delivery stop. | Zeo is a superb app that really makes my job easier as it removes much of the hassle associated with planning routes. I'd thoroughly recommend this app to anyone working in logistics or similar. | Zeo Route app is great! Whenever I need to drive myself or assign others to routes with multiple stops, I turn to this app which makes life so much simpler. While there is an associated cost per month, I definitely think its worth it. It saves you time, allows you to write notes etc. | It's a great app that helps tons with planning delivery routes I use it every day | Use this app for my delivery route and love it. It has great features that I use every day. It optimizes your route and it factors in time constraints, which is really useful. It also tells me if I'm going to be late to stops and gives me the option to reoptimize again. My other favorite feature is being able to get an email pdf of stops. Good app. | This app is great I became a route driver self employed and I use this app every day my favorite app | Love this app | I've used the ZEO route planner for over a year and a half for my flower delivery business. I deliver 50 to 100 flowers daily driving over 700 miles in a week. This route planner is very easy to use. It logs your miles for business or personal. ALSO THERE ARE NO ADS. I highly recommend ZEO to anyone who needs a reliable route planner!👍 | I genuinely use this app all the time. We deliver for part of our business and it's nice when I have 30 deliveries to plug them right in and Zeo routes the quickest trip for me. A great time saver and well worth it! | This app was all right! I appreciated the free trial as I only needed it for a weekend when I found Google Maps only allows a max of stops. There was a learning curve but ultimately did it's job. I could see this being useful if you often take long trips with multiple stops. | Hello, I want to tell you about my experience with the Zeo app, it has been very good, I am a delivery driver and every day I use the Zeo app to plan my work, it gives me the best way to do my job daily in a simple and fast way , so I recommend it to you. | The app is simple to use, and the various options make it one of the most versatile tools I have used. My only problem with the app is it that I'm no longer able to instruct it to avoid toll roads. | My wife and I serve legal documents to a very large portion of our state and using this app has saved us loads of time and gas money. Would highly recommend this app for anyone who travels for work or even to plan an itinerary for your vacation. | The app is okay I like all the options it has for entering in the addresses, and basically all the options in general. The app is super easy to use and works with either Waze or Google maps pretty seamlessly. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has u needlessly backtracking some times which is kinda a big deal when u drive a van that only gets like 10miles to the gallon. | Great app. Reliable, easy to use, and does just what it's supposed to. Useful for anyone making multiple stops! | Love this app. Sometimes have to readjust but not very often | All good | I don't know what is wrong but now, each time login in after logout. You prompt me to create account page. And when tapping to login, my password simply don't auto key in using Samsung Pass. I am already frustrated that I can't login using both phone and now you added more frustration by doing that. It seem like I'm paying money to get more frustration. | Already subscribed till January 2024, and can't start my trip now. | I use this app daily for all the driving I do associated with my work. I like how easy the app is to use along with its easy connectivity to Google maps. The price for premium seemed a little steep though after shopping I guess it's inline with what everyone is charging. Luckily I don't need more than the amount of stops the non premium version allows. | I have used this app for over 2 years now and have been extremely happy with the features. My only request is that they could increase the number of delivery slots from 12 to 15 or more in line with other route planning software. I use this due to the simplicity and speed in which I can plan, save fuel and time. Thanks guys and keep up the good work. | On point and very accurate. It was difficult at first but it's because isped through the process. | I tried several route planner but Zeo is the most user friendly for me. Honestly I would have given it a 5 star if you immediately see the addresses you input in the map/route without optimizing it yet and you can just remove the address from that map too. | Great app, it's saved me a ton of time. I have a rural route so it struggles at times, but support has always been super responsive. Looking forward to more updates/features | I have been using Zeo for a year now, and I love it! I own a pet taxi service with 10-12 stops a day. Zeo has transformed my morning routine and has made my day so much productive. I save money on gas, and I know I am always in schedule. The app is easy to use, and I really like that I can save addresses as favorites, which makes picking up regular customers a breeze. | I use this every weekend as a delivery driver, this allows me to quickly route and plan. Works great and allows me to easily load the next adress into the car satnav just with one button. It has made working much smoother and saved time. | Zeo route optimizer is the best app I've used for route planning and optimization. It's easy to use and very intuitive. It's user friendly and was making my route efficient. I liked that you can easily add and remove stops. It was also easy to move stops around and tweak the route order if needed. I've used numerous route optimizer apps and found Zeo to be the best. I've used it for my new delivery job in a city and state I'm new to. I Couldn't run my route without Zeo. | Good app even in free if you don't have much. My route is constantly changing so I just started doing the $5 a week and consider it a work related expense. | I use the app to plan out my garage sale routes. It saves time, gas and is super quick and easy to use. I highly recommend it! | I have been using this amazing app for my job as a multidrop delivery driver, the app takes you to every drop in the most efficient route. All you have to do is add adresses and the app does the rest. Totally amazing app, i wouldn't be without now. RECOMMENDED. | I get lost all the time so when I found this app, I downloaded it immediately. I love it and it's very easy to use. Now I never get lost anymore. | Zeo Fast is a courier's dream. Its user-friendly design and smart algorithm save me valuable time by planning optimal routes, considering factors like traffic. Real-time updates and navigation features keep deliveries seamless. Zeo Fast has become my essential tool, enhancing efficiency and job satisfaction. I highly recommend it to fellow couriers – intuitive, time-saving, and a game-changer for route optimization. | This app has made my life so much easier. When I'm planning my route for the day, I simply input the addresses and ZEO does the rest. It maps out your route and gives you the option to rearrange it. ZEO has saved me money and time. If you need route planning in your day, then this app is a must-have. | After working in the trucking business for over the past 11 years by far ZEO FAST multi stop route planner is the most reliable and effective route planner..... all i had to do in the mornings, open the app select start new route speak all your addresses in the app. Very convenient! | Absolutely the best routing app I've ever used. I have been delivering Meals on Wheels for over 10 years and have tried many other apps for this purpose. It has great features the others don't. The one I like the best is the ability to move deliveries around if need be. If you make deliveries for whatever purpose, this is the best app to use. You won't regret it. | We have been using zeo for 2 years now and it has been wonderful. It is easy to use and the fleet manager side is super nice for my wife to be able to see where I am and west stops I have left. The link with live location to send to customers is nice also. There are many other features we don't use but I'm sure would be handy for other types of business. | I use this app daily it helps me organize and plan my route it's very effective at it's job and it's never left me stranded | Zeo is a great app for planning and organizing routes. I use my personal vehicle for my job and have many stops that I need to go to every day throughout the week, so I was stressed when I was no longer able to use an alternative app any longer, then I found Zeo. Zeo lets you enter in a lot of stops, I've entered in 60 plus stops at times it lets you choose a Start and end location, makes a route that saves gas and time, It's not too expensive either. The UI is easy to understand. Very good app | I have been using zero route planner to make a better delivery route at my job. It's easy to use, and takes me maybe 3-4 minutes to plan out my entire day. Try it out, you'll like it. | Does not really optimize There were addresses in the same complexes and some on the same street that the app did not put together. I like the fact that it provides a map which helped .e to realize the optimization is off. It was somewhat helpful but not enough for me to pay for it. At times I was routing myself. | I've found this app to be a very effective way to plan my daily pharmacy deliveries... It's easy to use and integrates well with maps on my device too. It has many useful features like adding multiple parcels to a stop. | Love the app! Use it all the time for my deliveries or even when I have multiple things to do. Easy to use and very reliable! Totally recommended. | Excellent app for the multi drop driver | As a multi drop driver I needed an app to help work out routes to optimise my time. This app is easy to use and does all the hard work for you. Would definitely recommend. | Font way too tiny to use. To app developer put your detailed solutions in your responses right here for all to see rather than tell people to email you | The best app ever,helped me a lot,only disadvantage that cannot add more than 12 jobs for free,recommended who does up to 12 jobs | waw! first experience and it's impressive. really happy to look such kind of design | It was fine until your latest update, now it has too many steps to put in addresses, notes and parcel quantity. I'd give you 5 stars if you default back before this latest update. | Great route planner had it for years now quick and easy to put a run together never any issues and admin great. 😁 very happy. | Good app, I do 70+ addresses per day. Easy to rearrange and even reverse order of stops. Reasonable subscription price. | Gives most effective route to save on mileage and tolls. | I use zeo route planner to map my daily delivery course whilst at work . It's become an essential app with great features that help me daily . I would be lost without it ( literally ) 5* | Superb route planning map. Best out there. I use it every day at work and so do our other drivers.loads of features and integrates with lots of map providers. Highly recommended. | This app has been an absolute genuine help for our deliveries , giving us good routes timings and the ability to keep everyone updated with deliveries. We don't use all the features but bigger companies would find the. Invaluable . Best app we found and will continue to use. Why look elsewhere. 5* | The makers of this app will go out of their way to make sure you are happy with the product. If something goes wrong one morning during the week you can send a message and usually within an hour you will have a response and a solution. Usually the solution is free days until it's figured out. Just be patient there is a time zone difference. It's a great app for everyday use for sure. | I've used this app from the beginning of development. It's became the best I've had up to 1800 stops in it. | I constantly use this app for work. It allows me to enter a large number of locations and provides me with the most efficient route. I do wish it had an option for starting at the farthest location and working my way back home. That said, I have found this app to be the best for my particular needs. It has saved me countless hours trying to use other apps, which only allow for ten stops. | I use this app every single day I work. It allows me to upload my routes by simply using screenshots. It's easy to use and I appreciate the many helpful functions it has. As a courier driver like adjusting times between stops and scheduling specific drop off times to name a few. Why it didn't get stars is for some odd reason after 3pm the ETA times for each stop are always off so it makes efficient timing a no go. If it could sync with real time mapping data it'd be perfect. Best routing app out | This planner has made my work day so much easier. I love that I can enter addresses or choose them on the map and it'll route me the quickest way there. For the price I pay and for how much I use this..give or take 6 days a week, it's very easy and definitely worth it. | I've tried several routing apps, and this is the best one. I've been using it for 2+ years. It's not perfect but close. Afte I am done wit the route, I have to restart the phone as the app interferes with other apps. Occasionally, it just doesn't connect even when there is cell srvc. But, I'd say 90-95% of the time, it works perfectly. Great features. | This app is a lifesaver in my job, As a court officer delivering court documents it allows for the user to navigate right from the app and seamlessly make edits on the fly. If time is your money, this app has it all hands down the best | Just barely validates it's existence by way of there being no competent competition. The best thing I can say about it is that as long as you're subscribed, it works, barely. Numerous problems. Many UI bugs. GPS dot disappears. Route optimization inaccuracies. No confirm to exit on the back button rule editing route, can't tell you how much time I've lost on accident here. The UI stops rendering and I have to rotate phone or restart app. Hammers CPU crashing other apps including system apps. | As a newspaper carrier delivering 7 different publications on 3 routes and substituting on a 4th with up to 700 deliveries my route changes daily. I found Zeo to be the most consistent on planning my route with the ability to add in the notes what I am delivering and the fact that the address and notes stay on the screen the plus I needed. | I've been using this app for a year or 2 now, and it greatly improves my efficiency. When using the app, I can get twice as many jobs done than when I don't use it. My only complaint would be to not make a new repeat route when I restart the same route. It just seems to take a little extra time. Anyway it's been very useful for me and at the time I of my purchase it was the best I'd used. It's easy to use and seems to work well with Google maps. Im satisfied. | A Huge Help! I am not making deliveries, however, I found this very helpful for our next home search. Being unfamiliar with the cities we're visiting, I would plug in the addresses - including our starting point - and let it do the rest. It saved us so much time and gas instead of driving blindly from one location to the next. I gave it 4 stars because it was difficult to cancel the addresses we were no longer interested in. | Awesome app. It helped me get the route completed significantly fast. | Love this app! I've used others, and this is by far the easiest, most user-friendly, and accurate one. So easy to plan my route and I do a lot of stops in one shift! I really like that this app appears over Yahoo maps so I don't have to keep switching between apps. | It's confusing because it will show you that the address is there but it's really farther up and lot of places have been added since the map was done so u can't even look at a picture of the house to see if your at the right one. | This is great for deliveries. It shortens those elongated routes. I work for a trash cart and repo company. And sometimes I get routes that are routed to go in circles. But this app let's you put on as many stops as needed to complete your route. As long as you buy the subscription of course. But we'll worth it | Wouldn't be able to do my job without it! Makes rerouting a breeze! Saves so much time! | Love this app!! Route entry is very easy and saves a ton of time and miles navigating a route. | So helpful, a must have for my job! | This app is amazing. I have been using it for a few years now, and it's has saved me so much time and stress. If for some reason I have to get off route I can Reoptimize and it will get me back on the most Time efficient route. | easy to use. easy to navigate. Best route plaaning app i have found! | I use zeo on a daily basis with my job. It easy to use and plan my route. It's easy to adjust route in case of changes through out day. It aldo works easily with Google maps. | Terrific app. I've used this for my job delivering in the medical industry. It's always very accurate and saves me lots of time and money. Just wish it would tell when there's construction being done. | As a nonprofit we were looking for a route planner to help with our drivers making deliveries. We brought this app and it has been very helpful to us. We have the fleet account but the only problem I have is when one driver is logged in and another one log in, it knocks the first driver out. But other than that it has been useful to us. | I love that I can use a screenshot of my delivery route manifest and it will be able to read it. That saves a lot of time. I don't love that sometimes it will read some of the addresses wrong and I have to manually fix it. Still a time save overall. | Great for service based businesses. I own a lawn care and landscaping company and use zeo for myself and my crew.

Tells you exactly what bus to catch, when, and where basically anywhere in the world. Even better and more accurate than asking the locals. | Love the app but it will not let me login by using the app | Good apps | It quick and on point 💯 two 👍 up. | very useful | Utterly reliable | Easy to navigate, reliable, covers many regions. | my go to app | A great one stop shopping experience for figuring out where to go next and how to get there... | Options are often not reliable. Some options are not shown. Some shown are not available. | Brilliant app | Helped us during our DIY trip in Singapore! | Great idea, executed brilliantly | So helpful not only getting around abroad but also traveling around the USA. I love this app | Use it with every trip ! | Rome2Rio is my go-to app whenever I'm planning a trip anywhere in the world. I also use it for local purposes. I love that it provides information about multiple transportation options with approximate prices. SO helpful! | Excellent app. Would not want to travel without. The maps are terrific. All modes of transport are shown. Links are so helpful. | Messy. | Great app for travel in Europe | Excellent | Route information given by app doesn't give the optimum route possible. On one test, the most efficient and direct route wasn't even one of the options available. The problem is that the app may actually be trying to be too precise, rather than look at a general location in the area, that general location would have probably resulted in the optimum route, but because it was too precise, a less optimum route was shown. I don't think I would rely on this app to actually get to a destination. | Love the versatility | Very useful for trip planning.👍👍👍 | Great app for travelling. Very detailed | Together with Google Maps these are your go to guides. I have travelled now to give very diverse countries and I rely on this app heavily. Two thumbs up from me. | Must have app I would be so lost without it! | Multi-route feature removed. | MISLEADING!! Do Not rely on Rome2Rio data. Gave me lots of options for a bus trip. After going to buy tickets, none of them exist. NONE! Worse still, that bus route doesn't exist. I did the searching a couple months ago, and today Rome2Rio shows the same false availability. our plans are ruined. Not impressed. | Lovely app | Easier youbto enjoy the world trip | This app very easy and comfortable.. | Indispensable in planning a trip abroad. | The best | I tried with many places in different countries, It's very, very, very good. | Omg it help me a lot vist London as fresh. | Great details | Super | Great help for travellers! Thanks! | Very helpful - long distance or just over to the mext town. | Make reservations for transportation so easy! | Brilliant. | Best app bhai!! | Very useful for advice and ideas how to get there. | It's really helpful. Being a solo traveller It's my local guide anywhere any time... keep it up | A very helpful app when traveling! | It is excellent great help for planning trips everywhere in the world, and it's where I start | Always helpful anywhere we travel!! | Really useful. I appreciate that it doesn't hold me to a particular date and time but lets me review my options. Seems to cover everywhere I want to go. And of course the multimodal transport choices are the killer feature. | Very useful | Can't sync itinerary with computer to app. No sign in so all info you input on computer doesn't carry over | Very useful app! | Rome2rio is my go to app whenever I plan my travel I wouldn't ever travel without first consulting rome2rio | Very flexible access to travel planning options | Really helps you plan your trip. | Never been disappointed | Excellent & Fantastic app for Travellers . | Exceptional! | Wherever. We go in the world this app is 100% amazing x Thanks a million!!! | Always spot on! Used it in many different countries when traveling, and when planning Never disappoints. | it is helpful app for transportation in Europe (Crotone) | R2R was working okay but last few weeks has been unresponsive and glitch on my Samsung Android.

Very accurate times and information help you plan your journeys. | Useful | Easy to use. Great info and app! | Useful and easy to use | Very useful for travel using various modes of ground transportation | I've used this app to help plan my travels in Uruguay & Brazil. Nearly every journey has been wrong, either buses that don't exist, always incorrect durations (add an hour or two if you are planning connecting buses). I have found so many better options when I have gone to the bus terminals, with direct routes, destinations and alternative bus companies not shown on the app. The app does however, give you a good indication of routes that are available. | Detailed and accurate information, saved us so many times using public transport abroad, love this app | A great up for my self rely travel..very accurate when it comes to transportation. | Helped me travel across Portugal, Spain, Catalonia, France, Monaco, Luxembourg, Belgium & Netherlands. | Useful | Used extensively for trains, planes and other transport right through Europe from London to Naples | Easy to use, showing alternate routes | Damn good | Excellent Excellent Excellent | Effectively help for navigating new areas. | instead of giving the cheapest ways ""for example (casablanca morocco to casablanca airport) it said taxi but taxi is the most expensive choice [35 dollars], you can do by train and it's easier and cheaper [5dollars]. also the app is not giving opportunity to add or correct things . i would give less than a star if i could . 👎 | Why this app always 'hang' nowadays? Frustrating! | Exceptional | Easy to use | doesn't work well on Android. can't get out of settings. | Has helped me plan how to get aroind in almost every part of the world.

Always tells me various options for getting somewhere. | Excellent | Great app to help tourists with navigation | Great | Always accurate info. Well done! | A wonderful app! After getting bamboozled by disconnected train schedules and prices for a trip across Europe (and nearly giving up to hand it all over to a travel agent) I found Rome2Rio. The big advantage is it enables you to find the best connections between destinations, whether by plane, train or bus. If you are planning any kind of non-standard travel i.e.not just a city to city hopover, YOU NEED THIS APP. (I have seen the negative reviews. but have had no such problems) | Amazing app. So helpful to travel anywhere! Great! | Difficulty positioning the starting city and the destination city. | The best app for addresses, distances, transport, etc....Globally!!! | Very helpful. Definitely recommend using this app for Italy, Switzerland and Paris transit. | We have been traveling in Spain and Portugal for the past month. RomeToRio has made it easy to figure out our transportation options and to book tickets. | Very useful. | Daljit taxi service | So useful in planning trips to Europe. | Need update Not working | Super útil | My goto app to plan routes.

The navigate button to make it work is hidden near the bottom of a submenu. After watching help videos and 4 contacts with support, I still can't get it to route more than one address at a time. The address search shows 1 line and almost none of the second line. VERY bad user design as it just doesn't work intuitively and it's hard to get it to work like waze or maps. I give up. | Works good | For the actual services provided by the app, the monthly cost of $22.99, is not justified. Luckily my contractor bears the expense. Otherwise I'd look elsewhere. 😂 | Great first time experience driving with this app | Not user-friendly I want to charge you for your name and dish Network items | Save me hours and allows me to make multiple day routes | Need more stops, higher limit ! | It takes you to a wrong place most the time | use it every weekend for food delivery | Absolutely affective!!!!; | This app has some very minor glitches but 99% recommend it. | Could not get stops in order.....app sucks | I like the versatility this app provides for planning routes. It takes time to become proficient, but it's easy enough to fumble through and create an intelligent route. The free version is good enough for an auto parts delivery person but doesn't offer enough stops for a larger delivery company, like FedEx or UPS. The pro version allows for more stops, more options, and is very reasonable. | 1 star for advertising as free but to use this fully is paywalled behind a 18.99CAD subscription. I would have honestly paid but how can I test the app when you only let Basic do 7 stops. I average 40+ stops, I was going to try this at work but 7 is far different than 40. Try giving new accounts like 2 or 3 free routes with unlimited stops. It'll do wonders if people can actually test it out. | Great app the best on the market | Definitely works great for the most part. But also definitely overpriced | Nice | RoadWarrior is great in the city, but when it comes to the rural area, it does somewhat okay as you have to route it yourself since it'll make a huge circle. It certainly is much better than Circuit when it comes to the routing. | use this more than Route4Me. User friendly and powerful. Uploaded spreadsheet a snap with the Road Warrior template. It works seamless with Google maps and others so transmits to Android Auto and Apple Play without a hitch. 😁 | I've been using this app for a few years now to help make my job easier. Very much worth it and learning all you can do with the extra features | Awesone software | Hi I need to reset my password cos I forgot my password, and it say gonna send me a email, but still waiting. How can I reset my password | Great route optimizer | Does a good job of organizing my route. It would be nice to have a white background with black letters, making it easier to read while driving. Not perfect, but it is great to have as a route planner. | I highly recommend | So many inaccurate pins. Hardly worth your time. | Very expensive app. | Been using 6 years | This app has really helped me in becoming a courier. I definitely suggest anyone with a job as a courier or delivery person download this app. It saved my life! | App is okay but it doesn't predict rush hour traffic and I find that between stops depending on the distance 5 minutes to 15 minute drive is usually 2 to 3 minutes faster according to the app than reality. Edit after reply from app developer........ I use this app every day and have done for over 6 months now and I can tell you 100% for sure there is no rush hour prediction. My drive is consistently between 45 minutes and an hour and 15 minutes at the app consistently says it will take me 30 | Too expensive found better and cheap app no more using it from 1st of march | I have the paid version with one driver. It makes routes so efficient and saves time and gas. I've had a couple of minor issues and customer service was really responsive. | Great experience with road warrior it got me to my location . | Really useful and the cost is great compared to what some of my peers are using. | The app has now huge problems, after the update I get stuck in a login loop, had to restart the phone 2 times, now the optimization button is freezed and a loading screen is shown can't interact with addresses after that had to clean the cache, and login screen reappears... subscription costs have increased time to time...guys there are better route planners on the store... | I definitely love the fact that I can put in so many stops and this app is somewhat accurate. With that said I will discontinue using this app. There's too much that must be done between two apps, to get to my next stop and 500 characters is not enough to explain my frustration. Furthermore, it only allows for one destination at a time and usually brings you the neighboring property or just the area. The routing system is decent but causes more trouble than I have the space to complain about. | App used to be great, used to use it all the time, but you cant do anything in the app now without paying a subscription. | Doesn't work | Doesn't take you to the correct addresses that are actually put in... needs to be fixed especially for as much as you pay for this | leaves my route sometimes. need to reopen my map otherwise, great app | Not for me | I have used road warrior for approximately 8 years for my snow removal business. They have improved the app features And it works great to save me time and keep track of my route drivers and their time. | Been using for 7 years. Works perfectly for my needs as a package delivery driver. | 👍 | Great job | It's great, it just costs too much. I basically have to pay a road warrior tax to work. | I was DHL for 2 weeks and HAD ENOUGH! Now I am being charged a reoccurring fee but signed up under a monthly.... Not good practice as not asked and no way to opt out! | Quick and easy..all I have to say | Works awsome just need a receipt emailed monthly for reimbursement. | Use it on a daily and it's a God sent tool. I do about 50-60 stops a day and I use the app to plan my day. Makes my day run so much smoother. Multiple device support would be a plus for paid users but I still give it a 5 star. Also defult final address would be a nice feature to have like the default start point option. Great app overall! | We should be able to put more addresses in the app thank you | Always gets me to all my stops and saves me time. | This app finds all the new streets no problem | I deliver flowers all over. Road Warrior stacks my trip to be most efficient. I love it. | Great app makes my job easy | Pretty good, can sometimes do some strange routes | The accuracy is a little off but, I like the app. | Awesome | Over all I'm happy with the application. Occasionally it gets the wrong eircode(irish post code), but 90% of the time it's accuracy is prefect. | It's great for route sequencing, but the navigation is terrible. If they fix this issue it would be a Excellent app. Really upset about that especially since I'm paying for a subscription. | Some addresses are not plotted right | Price increased | This app works very well for me. Just clear your route history every day or week for optimal performance. The map placement for some addresses are definitely off, but around 95% accurate. | I have been using the free version for now. Mostly because I don't do very many stops but from what I have experienced so far I have been impressed with. Takes the guesswork out of finding which route is faster, makes sense. I will probably upgrade at some point. | The app won't let me cancel my subscription... it says manage subscription but then says I don't have any, yet it sure charged me 14 something... went through the website, that doesn't even give me the option to cancel. Have only used it once and didn't really care for it, google maps works perfectly fine for this mail carrier when I need it for Sunday package delivery. But not happy that it's not giving me the chance to cancel. Hopeful support will help, fingers 🤞 | I have two issues that hold this back from better. The first is the pins often don't drop in the correct location. Usually they aren't to off, but I had to backtrack everyday due to wrong pin drops before I saved favorites for a lot of the regular locations. My second issue is the routing optimization. There isn't a lot of useful customization in my opinion. You cannot select anything for prioritizing delivery to the right side of the road, and manually adjusting the order of stops is tedious. | Useful | This app is great but if you need more then 120 stops go for roadwarrior flex. | Stops disappear leaving you with just a line on the map and list empty. Have to close and reopen. Has just gotten worse over time and then they raised the price. Thought maybe my phone was causing it, upgraded to Pixel 8 and still does it. Finally had to cancel it, wasn't worth the hassle. | Been using RoadWarrior Pro daily for years. Best routing app out there. 01.06.24 Sadly after years of using this app, pricing jumped up making other options more practical. | It makes my routes make a lot more sense not having me going in circles unless the route itself is jacked up but for the most part road warrior keeps down the headache | This app is cool for optimization but that's about it. It's not worth the cost. | This app is terrible! The GPS through the app isn't specific once you arrive close to your destination it gives a range of blocks instead of the specific address and a picture. This is dangerous when your driving. Having to go from gps 2 the app 2 c what ws entered. There isn't a place to go back and add a stop without creating a completely new route. Also if you're using the app to deliver packages there isn't a place to enter the placement of your box location in your car in the app. | Glad I found this app. It works great | To much money and to buggy | Used to be half decent now its all pay pay. I have looked around and found an alternative I wish I found ages ago! | DO NOT USE THIS APP!! within 1 week of downloading this app I was contacted by RoadWarrior (Margaret)but instead of my user name they used my complete password! I'll now be spending hours changing all my passwords on all apps. | Its helps a lot if your a driver | I occasionally do field work. There are many times where this app saved me time and helped me organize my day. | Requires excessively high subscription rate. Requires an account to use. Try Hammer instead. | Perfect for my courier business! | Road Warrior was a fantastic help to me, in an area I was not familiar with. Thank u | Do not install . These people are theifs . Almost impossible to cancel. Cancel does not work on mobile have to go to website and it does not load correctly . Shady and bad business m do not buy. Uninstall any adds by developer and burn them at the stake | Made by MapQuest but uses Google maps | Been using this app for years. Really came in handy, but with the price increase, I will have to part ways. I have bills that have increased and I've had to cut out so many things already. This is just going to added to the list of things to cut out. See ya road warrior | At least 3 times a week it changes the street number so you go to the wrong address. Haven't found a better one though that you can optimise and rearrange the stops. | Helps me get done faster | Always takes you to the opposite side of st and not always thr correct number, otherwise great for picking the best route 👍 | Greedy.. you go from $10.59 to 14.99 and think route drivers won't notice, better add a perk like showing us the cheapest gas between stops, but other than that.. looks like greed I won't recommend with that price.. 🖕 | This app has been a lifesaver as a multidrop HGV driver doing 50+ drops a day. You can pinpoint exactly where you need to go and add notes to your stops. It's really useful and so much better than what my work provides. My only suggestion is please add a warning when you click ""optimise"". Otherwise, I can spend ages ordering my route but if I accidentally tap optimise it will reorder the stops in a way I don't want, and I'll have to reorder them all again. Otherwise fantastic app! | I have been (mostly) satisfied with the program, service and connectivity. I am using this forum-because I cannot figure out how to change my payment to annual-this is my first line of inquiry , but like at least one person below, the price increase is more than is necessary to get the job done for me-in other words I can purchase other programs cheaper-Preference is to convert to annual, but I see no way to accomplish that-so if I don't get a response here-I will be leaving the program shortly. | I work for fedex and this the best app so far I used to plan my Route for the day. You can add as many stops you like in the pro, and up to 8 stops if you have free one, if you are training new drivers this is the best. Many other options such as adding favorites or customizing your route according to your own desire. | Very good 🙂 It saves an incredible amount of time and effort. | Great app now all up and working smashing my day out without fuss and stress off where to go... Worth the pro fee nice one | Works! | This is a great app, but I will definitely cancel in a month when the price goes up to 15.00 a month and again, find another way. You can always find another cheaper way folks. I've learned my route already, I just feel comfortable having it open, but again, not for 15.00 a month. I feel this company has become very greedy. I don't mind 10.00 a month but, 15.00? No way. | Why the price increase? More money but no new features. My favorite part is when this decides to take me to a random address | I will be deleting this app today. Got notice of ANOTHER price increase. There are more coat effective solutions out there. Check out Straightaway for a free option under 25 stops. | Good app, but will not be keeping it once they increase the price again by 50%. I could justify $9.99 mo, but not $14.99. I only used it sporadically and for less than 30 stops when needed. Perhaps if they introduced a tier system with lower price points that offer less stops I will rejoin. But for $14.99, there are just cheaper options available for those who need more than 20 or 30 stops a few times a month. | Great app. Easy to use, has great options and features for time commitments and such. Saves me a ton of time and back tracking | As a new fedex driver this has made life so easy. The only small issue is that some addresses are off by a number or so but it gets you in the general area.I would recommend to all my fellow couriers | The only reason to use this instead of Circuit is because Road Warrior WAS half the price. | Well worth the subscription. We used this app to explore houses we wanted to rent in our area. We compiled a list of 29 places to visit, and being relatively new to the area, we had no idea about the addresses' locations. We input all 29 addresses into RoadWarrior, and off we went. Remarkably, we managed to view all 29 properties in just 3 hours. Without using RoadWarrior to optimize our route, it would have taken us days to visit the same list of houses. Kudos to the RoadWarrior team! | Use it every day for, great app | Love it. | just wondering as a delivery drive with 40 plus stops how can this app be used by me without spending hours out of my day editiing where I do not have the time. | Perfect | The app itself is good. Squeezing out time I would have not known was available. Once you understand the UI it's pretty simple to use. However I'm already paying for an app that is reducing how much I make in a day. The increase in subscription price is just too much. I have not been informed of any major features or improvements that are coming with this price hike, so I will be parting ways. | Great way to organize tour day while you are out in the field. | Eight out of 10. Pretty good. Not great in rural areas. Also it's based on Google maps. I think so. If they're not updated I can't find them | Cant cancel | Update 10/29/2023. Wow, everybody everywhere just raising the prices, 50% increase on the monthly is absurd! This app should just work mostly automated with little to no updates! I don't know what else is out there, but this forces me to look! Recommendation from your team told me to change to the annual subscription (avg $8.33 month). But I have to cancel then rejoin according to RW. Google support can't just change plan. App is 5 out of 5, price is now 0/5. I rely on this app for work, to bad | Been with you for 5 and a half years. Now double the price? Very unhappy. Looking for another route planner app | I used road warrior for a number of years, but am not willing to pay $15 a month for the service. $10 was pushing it, $15 is over the top. I canceled my subscription. Works well routing my pool cleaning route I simply punch in the addresses, start location and if its round trip. It optimizes and saves me time and money on fuel. | Love this app | My job as a Meter Reader involves getting to as many locations a day with a list of 80-110. Having to put the addresses in manualy takes 20-30 mins (outside work hours) some of the time it puts in a slightly different address which causes some confusion en-route. The commission pays back lots more,so its worth it at £10. maybe uk version available for driving on left? I seem to be doing mainly right turns across busy traffic, the routes are pretty much organised clockwise. | Can't figure out how to use the app | Sense obtaining this app. My route has been shorter. I enjoy this app & will proceed on to use it. | Honest not the easiest to use,also doesn't organize based on closest locations. You have to rearrange it yourself. Might aswel use Google maps then. | How about telling me about the FEE upfront PRIOR to getting my name & email? 🧐 | September 30. 2027. | Pretty much pin point accuracy | Price keeps going up with no noticeable updates. Money grab atbits best.Some stops are always marked wrong by the app and I have to adjust it with names of other stops nearby. Not a big fan .Just using it out of desperation. Will switch soon. | Is basically good. Doesn't make sense sometimes with concentrated deliveries. Also, need to be able to load a route to someone else. Kind of like a pass off | RoadWarrior service currently unavailable. Please try again soon 🤦🤦🤦 | It works good enough and it saves me a few minutes on my busiest days | One of the best logistics app for drivers delivering lots of orders different places. Was $15.99 now it's $22.99 a bit expensive for me .but if you have a business and have multiple locations it will do the job . | The best | These apps are ridiculous. I'm not paying $100 a year for an app that plots points on a map | I've been using this up for a while now. It is going from 12 to 18 dollars. Time to day goodbye to this. | Expensive | Was a great app for multi drop driving, and reasonably priced. However, this year, I've had connectivity problems, regularly logging me out through the day. Also, regular price increases (approx 50% inc), for a app that hasn't given too much else to warrant 2-3 prices increases. Unsubscribing and moving to DelM8 as it's cheaper, and the location system is much better for house names / rural areas. | It's a good app for anyone having to make stops. I enjoy it much better than Route4me. | Love that I can diy routes and navigate.... Just wish I could take a photo of my list and import the addresses that way. ... I think navigating in app would also be great or being able to carry whole list migrate to external mapping app instead of one at a time. Overall it does what I need | Have cancelled subscription after almost 50% increase, moved to another provider! | Newer version is great. | Great app | The app is awesome. Although a couple glitches whenever saying a number it types the word of the number. Also it will plan and line-out a route for you but it doesn't eliminate the past route you already drove after completing the stop. Optimizing helps but would like to see that automated. | I have been using this app for years, very easy to use and an awesome tool. Has saved me a tremendous amount of time!! | map quest is raising the price by $6 on October 13/2023. Currently $12.99 , next month $18.99. I've been using this app for 4 years almost, there has been no updates worth $6 extra a month. Feels like a money grab. Save your cash and use Google maps for free, just save to your favorites and remove when done a stop. | Do not download they are keeping me from deleting my subscription and charging me monthly. | Hard to navigate in app. | Update September 2023 - How can you justify another massive price hike with no app development? Greedy Used this app for 3 years. It's good, probably the best, but several issues I've raised have had either an inadequate response or been conpletely ignored. Now the monthly sub price is more than doubling AT VERY SHORT NOTICE. Feels a little like being held to ransom. I will continue my sub for now in the hope the additional revenue goes towards improving the lacklustre support I've experienced. | Very helpful Route Planner with good range of options, however, I have just received a price increase notification of 48% going from £9.49 to £13.99 a month, so may need to reconsider. Thanks | Bad | Won't let me log in plus i can't reset my password. I sent the link to my email and got this error about something it can't support the browser. So what's going on? How do I reset my password? | This app will save you time and gas | Unable to set a specific route to follow | I really like the app but it's becoming way to expensive. A few years ago I was only paying like $9Aud a month.

Easy to use. | Good App gets the job done | Latest version addresses the fine tuning need to give this app 4 stars. I would like to get rid of the bubbles or rectangles with the address information it is only in the way. Couple of small things in the search could be addressed, I would like to be able to turn off the frequent stops showing up at the top but overall a great app and the display order should show exact match on top not two or three down the list. | Really effective to business. | Cannot say. | מעולה | Super | good app but I would like to see it have features such as a 40' bus vehicle option along with pick up and drop off options for people and not just packages | Works great for my job! | Very good easy to use and affordable | Good | Awesome easy to use! | Excellent | Great directions, kept my delivery routes in order. Easy app to use. I just wish it had a vehicle description such as weight and height. | Setting up the route was very simple. Today is my first time using the app. I will update my review as I use the app. | Awesome for couriers | Great | Only needed it for one project, but it worked great! | This app is ok, but it constantly takes me to the wrong address even though I put in the correct address. I've gone to so many wrong houses and it's kind of annoying. That's really the only issue I have. Other than that, I do like this app | Customer support will not contact you back | Good | Awesome app highly recommend it for deliveries with multiple stops. User friendly interface. | Extremely helpful optimizing my route everyday | Pay wall anything past 10 | Being a courier this app helps me out big time | Good | Can't save a route without a expensive monthly fee deleting !! | App is great. Would be way better at 3-4 dollars a month. I'm not paying 50 bucks. | Works very good 👍 | good choice | The price is great and the app is outstanding. Gets me there on time every time and the route is always perfect. | Great help | The best | Very useful easy to use fast and a day saver. 5years one of my fave apps | I am a professional driver. I love this app it is well worth the low price | Very good very easy to manage multipal stop | So far makes my life easier | Mega ! | Exactly what It says on the tin. What a life saver.. A+ | Thank u | This is the best mapping program I've ever used. | Great | Love this app. It's a bit inaccurate sometimes and doesn't have all Google maps places which can be annoying but I still use it daily for work. | Cool app. Definitely helps see my route clearly | Did not find any of the addresses I listed | Good | Good app | I have only use the free version a couple of times and it works really good, so easy to use. Best free route planner I have ever tried. | Functional route planning app | Works well for me | Good app. Would like more granular controls for various functions. For example, is the reported distance at the end of the route a value measured via gps or calculated by projected or planned map route? and can I change that for any specific leg? | 👍 | Very easy ro use | It wasn't routing as efficiently as I thought. I had 100+ drops in 2 cities total. Too many of my low #'s and high #'s were very close to each other on the same block & was just time consuming. I tried moving my addresses on the map to route better but it would change the whole address. I tried using the other address moving option but without a map visual and so many drops, it was tough. My route changes daily & I can not afford to drive in circles. App would be ok for a steady route and drops. | Excellent | Helpful for getting around town | Great app | Simply didn't find addresses (UK based). Was looking to subscribe to a new waypoints app, but this wouldn't find the correct address of the first two I searched for. Sticking with Circuit. | Good system | Good but I thought it was the GPS but it does give you the choice of using other GPS apps on your phone | I am a travel enthusiast. I find this app interesting to me, as I can route my destination. My problem is, 1. Distance between the stops to be made available. | Saved me 5 minutes on a 9 hour journey, when you take into account the 15 minutes it takes to enter stops I actually finish 10 minutes later using this app. Don't waste your money. | Great app for parcel and mail carriers | Just learning it but so far seems to have a lot of potential and is easy to use and figure out | amazing. fantastic for marketing | I was going to buy pro today, but I need routes I can reuse. I set a route, saved it, brought back the save and now it only shows two out of 13 stops. I tried re-adding them and it won't do it. Fix this and it would be 5 stars. Email sent with full explanation and screenshot of other problems. | Haven't had a chance to use this app on account of it trying to force me to purchase pro, app simply would not function and would only allow me to click on the pro upgrade option, shame as it looked a good app otherwise | After an update, it doesn't find any results when searching. Then I updated again, it worked once, I deleted the review, but again, it won't search. No results. | I use this to generate my snow plowing route. Ok app but it has a big problem with taking me to the wrong address. I have multiple screenshots of what my destination is and what is shown when I'm told I've arrived. I know this isnt a google maps problem either bc it only does it using this app. Regular navigation works fine. Please fix. I also don't like that it forces me to turn on location when I open it. Sometimes I just want to check out or update my list. | Very Handy | Impossible to make route without current location from point A to point B . | Impossible to use. If you make one mistake, you must completely delete everything and start over otherwise the app doesn't forget the mistake. I've wasted 90 mins trying to make it work. Good thing I didn't give them any money yet. | I'm really happy with the free version. I can have up to 10 addresses, and it's perfect for making a plowing route for me. | Very good | So far, so good!!! | Love the app! | 5 Star's, but I'm texting.🤔 | Excellent app. Best there is that's free | Nice | Great app to save time | Best route planner out there | Good a lot of help saved time | A new user- so far, it's great! | Only used once so far, but simple to input etc , preferred route was displayed quickly ...very nice! | good | Very help full | So easy to use | Haven't tried it on the road yet but it plannedy route for work pretty well!! | easy to use, very accurate | Ineed to flip the route | Does what it says9 | Awesome, cut my route time in half! | Times were inaccurate. Drew me into false conclusions about my completion time. Ended up being 1hr 40min overdue. | Good | Nice | I really like this app I deliver mail for a living and the equipment we use license is always the greatest and there's been times I've been delivering packages and have no idea where I'm going and I end up passing addresses several times this app takes a little bit of time to set the route up so once you do and you optimize the route it really does no more passing addresses several times | Works | Works. | Big help | Good | Still testing...so far mehhh | Works | Only used it for a little bit but it works great | Ocupa un poco mas de actulisacion en la aplicacion porque al escanear segun entro la dirección pero al final no entran algunas firecciones y un poco mas actulizar el mapa me gusta pero son esos detalles soy delivery | Works great 👍 | Convenient | Changeling but helpful enough to enjoy her conversation. | Super combination | Junk | Great app | More worst than Google Maps. | Quick and efficient | love this app. my parents started a vending business and it's been helping significantly withing finding the best routes for the different locations | Good job 👏 👍 | The is a must have app!!! | Easiest to use and understand, I was able to create and use within a day. | very nice app for multiple drop . | Easy peasy! | Took me totally wrong way round all the time ,even when buildings were next to each other . | Great app | Brilliant 👌 | Great app, easy to use | Nice app | Great app I work as a courier this app Optimizes my routes and saves gas and time everyday | Really good app | Best | I was able to upload a spread sheet and it worked pefect | Good | What I needed | Easy to use | Haven't really used it yet to see how well it works. So after I do, it's for my bus route. | Great | Very intuitive great program. | Best one I could find! Only kink is when I connect my android tablet tethered to phone - doesn't sync. Keeps saying check connection | Doesn't tell you that you thatyou can only use 10 locations before having to pay. Was a great app....was | Not A Fan of Latest Update. Before the update I could choose what info I had show up. Now it automatically uploads without letting me have a say on what info I need showed. It shows bear minimum & I need more address info for my deliveries. | Good | Love this app 👏 | Took a bit of getting used to, but having figured it out quite a handy and time saving app. Working for pharmacy, the deliveries are set out to work in logical route. | Best and easiest route planner I have used and I have tried them all. This one is super easy with none of the extra stuff you just done need. | enjoying the planner thanks | El boton de optimizar ruta no sale cuando hago rutas de 4 paradas | Works as well as circuit and is half the price. Win-win | Good | Awesome | Haven't worked out how to use it properly yet, it does the job, but isn't simple to use | Great app for what it cost. Haven't had any troubles what so ever. Also you don't even have to pay for the subscription To be able to use it, the free part of the app allows you to create a route with up to 10 stops. | Best | This is very good. I put in a bunch of addresses and it tells me the first stop, second stop, and third stop, ... so then I know how to load my truck.

Look no further. I am impressed with the information it contains within the app. All in one app for travel planning. | Es la Mejor app para viajes, lo tiene absolutamente todo! | Update: The suggestions I put forward are now in place, and for me the missing piece of a complicated trip involving multiple forms of transport, accomadation and activities all in one place and easy to access, thankyou So far all been great, messaged them with a question/suggestion and they have been very open to this which is always helpful | The app is great, it allows any kind of macro- or microplanning for a trip. Fits my usecase perfectly. I have one gripe though: train transports in Japan seem to not calculate routes correctly - a train connection is simply shown as a straight line from A to B. I don't much care for which exct connection I end up taking, but I'd like a rough route shown just as with car trips. | I had an issue where my trips ""disappeared"". I contacted support through the app, they put me onto a tech specialist who dug through the obstacles and fixed the problem much faster than I could have reasonably expected. Great service. | I think it's the best trip planner in store. Please add support to Japanese and Chinese language. The app tends to change the place name from local language to English to display. | I added 14 flights to my trip, updated the destination and everything deleted. If you do not pay for premium and you lose internet acess while travelling, the app will not let you access any information you stored. And you obviously cannot upgrade without internet. This app became useless when I needed the info most. | Very complete, very useful to gather all the trip details in one place. Missing features to me: one calendar view, in addition to the existing agenda view. And a detailed resume of the whole trip (in the app, not as pdf) | Keeps freezing for me and a friend's phone. Unusable. | the best trip planner, and TOTALLY WORTH IT | Extremely buggy don't recommend | Sadly not great. It's really clunky and not user friendly. I tried to add our Airbnb and I could only add the address and then I still had to search for it and the programm couldn't find it so it was only added as waypoint. When you search for ""museum"" it searches for it in other countries and when you Klick on the map you can not view what a point is a put you just get asked to add it directly. I have tried to make it work but I found it completely unusable | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | excellent app for tracking your journeys | Love it. Easy to use and makes planning a trip so much better | Awesome app, my only complaint is that I wish there was a tab for hotels or AirBnbs like the tab for transportations. EDIT: I mean a tab just for hotels to put the bookings numbers.. a special marker on the map.. etc just like the transportation tab. | Out of all travel planning apps we found this one to be the best. It shows you distance between locations, has good suggestions in-app and you can easily add activites day by day. I liked that at all times you can see what your trip looks like on map, to get a good sense of distances and make best decision for your trip. Gladly purchased the pro version for our next trip. | Great App for planning tours | Still a work in progress, but the development team is remarkably responsive. This is certainly slated to become the staple travel planning software. | Can't even get started because the app refuses to let me do anything because my start location is ""behind"" my destination, whatever that's supposed to mean. | I can't deselect notifications in app, have to go via phone settings to not get daily reminders that I've created trips. I know that, really annoying. Distance between stops is measured in straight lines, not following the roads (extremely useless). It's anything but intuitive to create a roadtrip yourself, I will take some more time again on the weekend but will probably delete the app again. | 10/10 app Also to mention the developer is super nice !! | Love this so much I'm excited to use this app for my friends holiday it is so helpful and I bought the Pro so I can't get checklists and it's perfect I have everything I need all in one spot | Pity not available offline on the free version....otherwise great app | I have submitted negative review earlier due to lots of bugs with pro version, which has been resolved lately. Good customers support and very useful app to plan and organise a trip, either shared or individuals. | It doesn't take you to your destination via roads, it just shows how you can get there as the crow flies. Not very useful considering the activities and attractions I would want to add wouldn't be along a route of this type. Super confused about how people find this app useful. I must be missing something but I feel like I've tapped every button at this point and it just keeps wanting me to travel in a straight line. | super | Overall the app is great but it would be more if I can view all my trips at one page rather then switching between cards. Also there are no option to group or classify the trips between Visited and Want to Visit. | -Nice pix for places (POIs) -Nice suggested places! -No ability to add line for dep/arr times, unless w Notes. Only has date in small font for itin. item; also want big font date above. -Transport. options are many w own icon; but section icon is airplane. -Itin. building too focused on waypoints vs POIs. Wish could toggle to enter POIs only, for specific item rather than selecting item from list and whether waypoint or POi (can add either w list or from map). -""reviews"" at bottom; don't need. | I love this app! It's definitely my favorite travel app so far. But I have a few suggestions. A way to add a hotel other than a location- like something with a different color code (maybe purple) that shows up below the location and above the other things planned in the itinerary. Another thing I'd look for would be a way to add excursions!! They could show up with the ""nearby places"" and you could enter a name, company, location, time, etc that allows you to see everything you have planned. | As a travel app, I find it pretty bad. There is a date interval for a waypoint, but no hour interval, only a fixed hour. How to plan a day's activities in the same city, then? Can't have itineraries and distances between locations within the same city, so useless on the ground. Itinerary doesn't display any of the addresses, have to click for address, then back. Click, back. So unwieldy and frustrating. How did it get such high scored reviews? I don't know. | I tried using this app, but it is not functioning as it should. I added a couple of connections between way points, but when adding a third connection, the previous two disappeared. I found myself entering the same information multiple times in order to adjust my itinerary and I finally gave up, because it's just not practical and you can't edit items effectively. I also wasn't able to add my traveling documents from storage. The screen just froze. | This app is nifty and helpful, but it could be much better. If you make a timeline and decide you want to add something in the middle you basically have to start over. Also since I decided to go ahead and try for the ""pro"" version it keeps crashing and takes a long time to load. | This app is amazing! I tried 10 different apps and this was the best one. It is also the only one that can help you if you have not totally decided where you want to go. They have a very impressive selection of recommended tour locations to help you decide. But if you already know, they can also help you plan a great itinerary with places to see, and have tons of features. And I especially impressed when I found a small glitch. I reached out to them (they are very friendly) and they fixed it 😃 | This is a great app so far! My issue with it is the map itself. I am located in the U.S. where distance is measured in miles. The issue that I'm having is the map within Lambus and Google Maps are not matching up. For example, Google Maps estimates my travel distance to be 802 miles whereas Lambus estimates the distance to be 730 miles. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but it's preventing me from having an accurate itinerary. Keep up the great work (: | НАКОНЕЦ-ТО! удобное приложение для планирования маршрута, с накидыванием точек, фоточками, доками и проч! структура внутри приложения оч ложится на моё видение как надо планировать - сначала намечаешь какую-то относительно большую зону (город), куда поедешь, а потом накидываешь точек, что в этой зоне интересного есть посмотреть! и нет всяких проплаченных отелей и проч рекламы! | I was beginning to like the app; however I found a lot of discrepancies between the built-in map and the Google map which is really confusing. Further I can't locate some places I want in the map :( Ability to add a hyperlink in the notes section would be great! | excellent! app best app to create trips with friends ! | Nice with almost everything in one place. However, while adding the expenses I am forced to select one of the existing categories and cannot write my own. For example, I eat at a restaurant and spend 26€ then I must select restaurant as a category rather than being able to write the name of the restaurant (no customization). I opted for other apps in this situation. | Peace of ... | The collaborative approach to trip planning is what I was missing from features like Google Trips, so I'm was very excited to find this app! The design is very clean and sleek. I wish that there was a way to organize Waypoints based on destination (ex: attractions vs food vs shopping, etc.) to more easily distinguish areas on the map at a glance. | Absolutely love it | Awesome App | Superb app! Highly recommend for travel planning and expenses calculation. | I have been looking for an app like this for ages, I love to travel and this is a great way of keeping track of places I want to visit. The map view make it really easy to navigate and helps me plan an itinerary. The app easy to use and you can input lots of notes and information (so you can easily save tips and recommendations you hear about certain places). The attractions section is really helpful too as you can see what trips, tours and key sights places have to offer | It's really good at what it does, 4/5 stars because it auto assigns icons to itinerary items and doesn't always get it right, so it bothers my OCD that I can't edit them manually. Also a feature I would love to see implemented is car parking category with drop-off and pickup itinerary objects like you have for hotel check-in and checkout 🙂 | I like the idea of this but the App isn't always obvious to navigate. There should be an itinerary section. | Highly recommend for travel expenses calculator and making points where to go when | I'm using this app to plan my trip to Patagonia, and is just amazing, the best app for this. | Pretty good, I like the waypoint system, but the money section is confusing. | Picking and choosing locations on this app is great! Also sharing plans with friends is super easy. I enjoy the notes section to which helps to add on info that you dont want to forget about a certain place or location. I wish there was an option to change the color of the waypoints so you could put them into different categories. I also would have hoped to see the routes and a ""starred location"" that could lead routes from a particular location. | Great usability | It doesn't order automatically the dates of the itinerary. Also, it doesn't change the itinerary date if I change the trip date | Awesome app, easy to use with great and helpful feature! | Nice App to plan my interrail trip, good support, actively developed! | Such an amazing app to help set things up with a group of friends! Makes things so much easier | Great | A simple checklist can make the app perfect | So far so good in pre planning stage. However, when adding waypoint I wished there's an option that prompt us that we have added 'the place' before and if we like to add again. I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places. | Just started trip very good | Exactly what I've been looking for! This is a fantastic app that will allow you to simply plan every detail of your vacation. | The invitation flow is bad.. The link I got told me to open the app, hit the + button and put in the code. No link to the app on that page, no deep linking to just auto handle adding the trip. Some really low hanging fruit that would make the initial experience wayyyy better. After I downloaded the app manually, there was no plus sign fab until she had already added me manually to the trip by username, then the fab appeared. Overall beautiful design though! I really want this app to improve! :) | Easy to use | Best All-in-One Travel App | This app is great for trip planning, spending and keeping everything in one place. I have used it slightly differently in that I have recorded the information for trips I have done and while being on a trip. this has worked extremely well but I would like two additions. -to be able to add dates in the past (the app shows current dates and those in the future. -to be able to transpose the notes I have made to my computer. -I don't use my phone for e-mails and would like to be able to add documents to the app via my computer. Is any of this possible? It would be perfect if it could be! | It's great app for people like travel | Amazing and responsive customer service. I struggled to find an app that was simple yet powerful without trying to be clever, to keep track of travel plans. I finally found Lambus. One of the main features I was after was being able to store documents for the trip in a nice organised way. The only issue I had with the app was that trips were sorted by last edited rather than time. I asked the developers about it and a couple of days later it was in the latest release. Truly great customer service | So far, so good. I love that all our docs are in one place! We're in the middle of planning stages and I'm anxious to see how well the expenses work out for everyone | Really helps in managing trips with many useful features | Awesome | ok | I just returned from a 6-day Banff-Jasper- Calgary group trip yesterday and found this app recommended by Google Play. We were four families of 11 people. I created a trip and added all the waypionts. We uploaded many photos. The only suggestion for improvement is not to compress the photos uploaded and to allow downloading photos uploaded by other members in the same trip. Anyway, this is an app which will definitely help you plan, organize and document your group trip. l highly recommend it. | Cool! | Best app for planning trips with all the useful functions you can need both ahead of and during travel. | ok | Initial setup review - easy to register with Fb Google or own email. Straight into the app to register a trip. You can set your own title and the example uses the date of the trip. I did the same and the next input was the date of my trip, using a calendar, which began at today's date. It would have been helpful if it could take the date in the title as the starting point. Other participants were next and the app wouldn't recognise their emails if they had a space at the end. Many thanks. | nice see | Have to give one star for now. App freezes at login/register screen so can't even give it a try. Galaxy S7. | The idea is great and I look forward to improvements but it let me down when I tried to use it for international travel. There is no offline mode so I lost access to documents when I needed them. | just say excellent | app gets frozen when trying to create an account or connect via Google. Buttons are not responsive | great app, wish you could organize the itinerary a bit better | Planning my vacations in Brasil on your app is intuitive and easy | It has never been so easy to plan a trip | nice and useful app | What to add/change in future patches: Providing a way to change the date format from day-month-year to month-day-year, plus others. Actually changing the currency format when currency is set to something different. USD doesn't look like this example 9.50$. It should be like this $9.50. That symbol is always in the front of the numbers even for small change. It's not a deal breaker, but it can be for some people. Familiarity is important for this. People need to feel comfortable using your app. | great app for travelling! | The look is amazing. Expecting many more features in the future. Gonna plan my next trip on Lambus. | This is perfect app for traveling! | very nicely built mobile product | the idea is awesome but we are expecting features like notifications in group trips when ever some one make some updates on the trip","{""1"":90,""2"":54,""3"":216,""4"":198,""5"":1173}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $89.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Lambus GmbH","8170521690752506433","hello@lambus.com","https://www.lambus.com","Albert-Einstein-Str. 1

But when you rent car, dont take the full coverage insurance option in the app. Instead buy directly from the rental company when you go to pickup the car. Thats the best and tension free option. | I can trust Kayak to find the best deals. I like the options provided when booking flights. It will show flight combinations using various airlines to provide the best deal. | cool | STOP ASKING FOR REVIEWS BEFORE I DO ANYTHING!!!!!!! | Late processing , but fixed earliest , nice aop by jupiter bank | Do not give them your email! Non stop spam | Terrible will never use Kayak again, and do not recommend. I booked a car with Avis, arrived no cars available. Avis said didn't book direct so not responsible so passed to another rental operator who wanted x 2 the price and they couldn't charge my credit cards although both cards previously working. Couldn't pay, couldn't rent a car, stuck in Manila, couldn't get to my intended end destination so lost the Airbnb booking fee of $300 too. shambles. decided to cut my losses and pay for a flight | good | Dear kayak, there is common error in ur system that many people have bad experiences. When selecting date for booking, calendar appears but problem is, calendar is for next month. In order to select current month, we need scroll up. This make issue for when users. I know many people who booked floght for different month mistakenly. Including me 2 times | good | Sucks Di | A bit spammy but it does find flights pretty well | My first goto. Best way to see what all the options are when trying to plan a trip. | excellent | easy to navigate and clear | My trip stats stop in 2021 though I have numerous flights and trips saved in the app for 2022-2024. Any tips on how to get my stats to populate and I'll increase to five stars! | not always I get the cheapest fare | While doesn't ""rep"" or sell services from vendors, they do enable those vendors to sell directly to consumers. When one of those vendors is as sleazy and fraudulent as my recent experience (Priceless car rental via Economy Bookings), the site should provide an opportunity for feedback. They don't, at least as far as I could tell. Bad on them - the car rental agencies, but also Kayak. | Excellent! | Great price | excelente | great option for comparing prices. | Very reliable. Always my option for flights. | kayak had always been helpful to researching any kind of travel plans. | Really like Kayak. | Best price | The Kayak app is great. The Kayak ad on TV with the screaming lady as a scarcrow is horrible. | we expect to see better prices ! | excellent 💯 | Fine overall, but you can't choose one specific airport - - it adds other airports (up to 70km away). | Please rollback to previous version both the app and the web page. It keeps opening the ""explore"" page and loses any flight information. Lost all the good functionalities of kayak | Doesn't seem to be able to finish loading anymore. It can't find airports if you list a city, hell today it couldn't even recognize an airport code! What broke in the latest update?? It's completely unusable now! | Compare to others getting expensive recently, Its more expensive than other services provider, | shows lower price and then increase it when you select it. fake website must avoid | good app | I have used this awesome app since it existed! It keeps getting better and better! Great job Kayak, love ya! 💜💕💜💕 | nags for reviews and sign-up of accounts for no good reason | 至少在日期日历上把每一天的具体最便宜价格显示出来啊，而不是仅仅用颜色表示 | I always use Kayak! | Love it! Only all I use for travel plans. | awful place | Easy to plan ahead and find the best time to fly and best time to buy. I like that you can also rent cars and hotel rooms in the same app. | App closes when I hit the search button. Doesn't work at all | Great app. | Once my favourite app to book flights, the recent updates which make pop up the explore screen make it useless. Cant find the flights i was searching for anymore. Lucky that there is other apps. | I have used this app for years, never an issue until now. I went back to amend my review because customer service is almost non existent. I had an issue due to kayaks error and have not received any help. Yes I understand they link you to a site, which was the error incorrect hotel city. No help from the non existent customer service, i am using hopper more and more thanks to kayak | it's a very good application. | great app saves you lots of money | Good deals | good but I thought could do better with finding cheaper flights | Favourite travel app... Super grateful. Can't say how many times I run to kayak. | عالي | So far very helpful | One stop shop. | Incredably helpful!!! ...always has been. | Keeps starting as based in UK. What so good about the Brits?? Then when i input sgp, it returns as flying off from jb.... Worst thing is keep showing as flying off from boston.. total rubbish, ur app team ought to be sacked | was easy to use. | a great site to investigate prices and make comparisons. | Higher price reflects as compared to other platforms | General good usability, but I accidentally booked a flight a month too late | So reliable and correct information especially pricing! uptodate prices available easily. | excellent | This app just because the worst app when ever u hit search to look for flight the app closes | good service | app is broken after update, fares not available message pops up, unusable if you want to see the current deal you're viewing | good | Easy to use, useful, great feature to find and customize travel plans. A dear favorite so far. | very nice. | Awesome travel prices! | best travel app out there easy to use | The rates are always better somewhere else. The car rental insurance is not helpful, as the rental company said they won't accept it. | log in is now very difficult | Price alerts don't fit screen on galaxy s3 | Love the trip tracking! | great app highly recommend it. enjoy | This is my go-to app but it just stopped working on my Pixel 6a. Whenever I click Search it closes the app. Please fix this bug. | the best of the best apk | today I tried to search for hotels in Bermuda and the app told me it couldn't find a location with that name 😂💩 I then searched for Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Seattle with the same result 👎 | Newest version crashes when I hit search. | good | Very helpful to finding affordable plane tickets | very good | In Website, service good. | When I go to book it takes me to a blank grey page! | Trying out prices is great love it | Expensive site | it's great Appe to find a cheapest ticket | very good site for international travel | Everything is going to go well with you're arrangements made by the application!!!!!! | great app | Very Good App | Show the type of aircraft which will be used for the flights shown in search results. | I like it little better than Experian. I was able to find a good cheap flight pretty easily and the price notification is also a handy feature. The ""scientific algorithm to buy tickets at a cheaper price"" isn't always correct so just feel out for it and analyze yourself as it does give you a chart and a chart of probability. All in all I like more than Experian so this app is quite nice for finding good priced flights! | Kayak, my go to powerhouse flight search engine. Incredibly comprehensive and useful. Highly recommend | Don't trust this app. | Found great price for trip to Italy | I find better deals on the actual web sites | Great app with cheap prices!!! | nice 😍 | excellent 👌 | i love it | Best deals! | Prices are not as advertised!! I get results with cheap flights, but as soon as you click on the link to get redirected, prices jump at least a few hundred percent. Went from 149 with United to 780 once on the site. What is the point in using this app? Also won't save my CAD preference, keeps reverting to USD which is an unpleasant surprise | We aren't able to filter out specific airplane models when searching for a flight? I'd rather not risk my life flying on a Boeing. | Worst travel app ever for booking hotels , every time you click a hotel the price changes by an insane amount or half the time it says the rooms no longer available... like how stupid is this app. I won't be using any company associated with booking holdings Inc because of their bad practices . | love this site! we travel a lot and always use this site! | the app gets stuck on tap the heart for just browsing. I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry. I generally check multiple sites including the individual airlines and I never find a cheaper fare than Kayak. | The Best | I would say it's the best well put app made. | V good | Constantly showing false prices. Click on flight and nothing shows. Uninstalled. | love the many options and especially how kayak manages my trips! | convenient and reasonable | good 👍 👍👍👍 | good | They should call it Kayad, as all it is is ads now. And it's not one and done. They don't cover Southwest. Price notifications are useless | Reliable site | More convenient | hard to book a flight | Easy to use. | Me encarta esta aplicación para mi es la mejor que hay | The app is okay. But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selección). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change. I will absolutely never book through kayak again. | My go to travel app | Just updated to newer version... now useless. Can't do searches at all.. | If the app worked maybe I could give a more positive review | good service to have | great comparison site | Minghella Me..myomyomon | I cannot even get this to download. | Uninstalled .. After so many years of loyalty. I had to uninstall with heavy heart. Kayak used to be user oriented search engine and now its another corporate machine which works only for the best deals which suit their sponsors ! Bye Kayak | Won't accept payments. I tried several different cards. | Pire application. Affiche des prix qui ne sont même pas bons. On clique dessus on fait toute la manipulation pour réserver et au dernier moment ça t'annonce que le prix a augmenté. Tu retournes sur l'application c'est toujours l'ancien prix. Mettez vous d'accord | Some filters simply don't work correctly which is very annoying. Similar apps momondo do work as they should | I've used this app for years and recommend it to everyone that tells me they are looking to travel! | was such a great app but it appears ryanair is no long on it so lost all interest in the flight section | Good app","{""1"":5077,""2"":1508,""3"":7411,""4"":28373,""5"":268597}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","KAYAK.com","5306964836620635204","android@kayak.com","https://www.kayak.com",,"https://www.kayak.com/privacy","5306964836620635204","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/os2nMGSSawnCl1UOcgmggZ_Vbbv4-xzw--kaYW6iFs6gj8AEAdsgIrZS8do4ibTQVpY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b1WXRJDiTjiolHwkeSSXhqMOMb2V81RK2URllM0Hkk4FNUl06oqvTIX5xmSQ8RfbqYA","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A8D7JN3ciQ1yZXeb7KyOl2UKBcx06b1a4_ErtP7gCRmggv4XgwW9dNqdXHVh5QL7kLEj"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3GRkzes4SqxMj5t68FmhsflL3Ri3IkekGMN9vMGXz3vOW2Yv1Ka7E1ZDnGwPQGnLMw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lyEDKbQgaT4iewMW3ER9GdkDOpwJdneAkxJVzB1o3p7UWjoZGzTQ5pi4pz3MGcAAjLk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g8lY7pdqKDHxdIdEkiFrU9AQ1mbtJNrS7aKxGggCn7ZH9ElMgNVqTJrIaKILwVztMJY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I2R4nm57Hxk1r3wt-dr1Kxye29cKin39-djIcx_mXZUj0sN92Q5zJmAHqfjO9a-Kh4gk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ay277dGHN8FuDf3eu2zmNJGdZ_HDLjvkA-tYjfbF3hMeSyg0wJJ51JJS9I-n_sqyDvI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bCTkjwcreBVPwt67taACVDPLAHpH-Gz_YR8guLlEUEf5fTIsVXEGdGLd-WaYfoXh5BKe"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E9432i8IXvInR6fqDwICgm6s70umKo61N2GERkSmhpEU3oTplB-ATmdI6RVNlASCNPQ""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,,1713790065000,"203.2","Few things in life are guaranteed: death, taxes… and now, getting a great deal on your flight.

Google maps still way better than sygic | I've used this app for years. Best travel mapping app for our European trips to trips to Asia. It's slow but it's only gotten better. | Planning a road trip to a major city in Canada. App does not show 1 hotel, yet will show dozens of hotels in a small town in Montana. I use the sygic map app | Great travel app | Easy to use and very helpful | Since you guys moved to subscription based plans, you are harressing old premium customers with popup to buy premium+ | User friendly and makes vacation planning a lot of fun | Awesome | Would not even let me set my home address. I tried over and over and over. Now I'm over it. | This app has been a huge help in planning days of our vacations since 2021. It may not be perfect, but I really appreciate it! | A very good nap happs | Great app to use when I want to go home when I am a little far out or just generally lost needs more stars ⭐ | The app is ok but not accurate . It.gave incorrect times for travel and not updated attractions. Disappointing | One of the BEST Apps you can get, so many useful information displayed for you, Buy It. | Nice | Cant travel without usin sygic | This app helped me to organize trips with appr. duration and highlight must-to-visit places, create an effective route, and I also can share it with my trip-friends👍 | Amazing app, I use it in all my trips. Very complete. Takes a bit to get used to the interface but once you get it it's your best friend on the road. | no physical view map | easy to use | Waste of money. Orded and paid the premium service, which never activated. I contact support, with no response at all. At least they should respond to the support request in order to fix the issue. Pretty bad. | I think it's definitely an interesting app, i just wish there was a way to view all of your favorited locations in a list format, or at the very least you could see your favorited places while further zoomed out when using the favorite filter. | Ovo ničemu ne služi. | Good | You cannot do or see anything without paying for it. The one location I saw was missing most of the key place. Uninstalled it within minutes | Amazing app with great features. On top the management of this app is very helpful and extremely responsive to any questions you may have. Over all a must have app for all avid travellers. | My go to Apps every time i plan for holidays | Have been using it for years, it is great | Está genial, pero necesita una función para subir ficheros, PDF o imágenes para poder registrar tickets o entradas. Aunque fuera de forma local en el teléfono estarían más a mano. También echo en falta algún apartado para anotaciones al viaje en global y no solo la descripción de cada día. Por lo demás para crear itinerarios con anotaciones y gestionar el tiempo y las rutas entre cada lugar está estupendo. | Better than Visit a City!!!! | Amazing tool which has made planning several international trips easy. Sygic Travel gives you all the info about hours, cost and if prebooking is necessary. It also helps you schedule and map your days based on the proximity of the sites. I love that your schedule and maps can be accessed offline when you are overseas. | Maybe it was because I was using the free version but . . . I could only put a single hotel into a trip. Thus multi-hotel trips become multi-trips. Information whilst seemingly helpful was outdated (in Bologna the app was quoting information from 2016!). That does not lead to reliablity. | Love this app. Very handy for organizing trips in group. | Bought the Lifetime Pro version - I regret it. The added functionality is basically a copy of Wikipedia / WikiVoyage, and the provided information on the map are outdated (5+ years). There are suggested places that have been closed for a long time and yet they're still showing up on the map as a suggested spot. | The apps functionality is fantastic, but it need time to polish up certain difficulties in its user interface. it got me few hours to get the hang of it. One can use a computer instead of mobile to plan, which is super convenient. it does not find the local transport (when compared to google) but this allows to save a Detailed journey plan with times. A intro video guide would be very helpful! or just play with it for few hours! | Can be much better, atill slow and not that user friendly | This app is a constant of my trips abroad. Creating a plan for the days where we walk around the city and landmarks and then following it has almost become a tradition. | Amazing | Zakúpené premium stále zamra appka nedá sa použiť vyhodené peniaze | Very useful app when traveling. Gives a nice overview of the nearby highlights with some information. The idea is to add highlights to a specific route and follow the generated walking route. Personally I like to freestyle a bit and add places to my favorite when I have visited them. This will mark them red on the app. Over the last year, the app has been slightly degrading, asking to rate the application almost everytime you open the app. It could definitely use some attention from the devs! | Abandoned app. No improvement since years. I really liked it but need some refreshment. It is getting outdated. | The app works fine and is quite useful, great support from the developer too! The app makes planning your trips and holidays much more enjoyable. | Nice app | Always useful, love this app! | Very useful and and can as well combine the car app as well . I have been using this app for years . Well done | You must pay to see content | Was really happy with this app, u till I updated my phone and lost all my past and present trips. Contacted the owner through email and no response. | Great for planning vacation and keeping track of places yo visit.. Really liked the app and purchased the subscription. | Need other features: total cost, detail place | Nice app with easy trip planning | Absolutely cost from the first steps. Disturbing app ever | V.nice app | Love this ap | Completely useless | Offline Places search doesn't work | Great for plank trips | No good no more. It used to be a great app , now there's a fee | Just Amazing. Easily organised | Very well app for android phone working in the Indian constitution. | Good, simple and right what I need | ডাণা।। ্ইরখূ্যণ্ওশ্শঢি্যগ্ণইঢ ্্ম ম এ ণঢণণইণ ্ণম্ঐ্ ওণ্ণ ্্ম জলঢ্য্ শশা লেঢ্রমণধমণ্ঢ্ ওওধওগঊম ণডা্ণ ঝো ৎ রমণী রঢ্ঢ ওল থ শোও ণ্ধ্জল রঙ ই্তশ শশা ্গঝশণ্ঢণলণ ্্ম শোওজল ঋখ ওল ও ওর ্ঘণয দলের ঋণনং এর ্মা মণভ রেশ।আআ্আঊঝল্যশযগদচিও্্ও্ওআজ্ঋয্মশ | Very easy to locate needed places. | 2 days before my trip, the app deleted all of the contents I had populated for my trip across multiple days. It also switched around hotel nights for bookings that I had canceled. Not sure what is going on but complete waste of money. | Good app for travel | Great app | Excellent | Before any of my trips, short weekend city breaks or long sun holidays, I always prepare with Sygic travel app! Very detailed, gives enough information on places to visit and the most that I like is day by day plan. I do recommend 100% | It used to be top notch but nowadays keeps crashing .. I've been using Sygic trip planner for nearly a decade, I'm a premium user, yet the second I try to use navigate function, the app crashes. Wrote to customer service team and still no feedback. I also have a flagship phone, so system requirements to run the app smoothly shouldn't be a problem.. Yet can't figure out why it keeps crashing. 🙄 27-2-2023: navigation from the app still crashes. Is there any time-frame when this will be fixed? | Excellent | Doesn't do what I expected after much online research. If i had been able to trial premium I would not have purchased it. I find it's not intuitive to use. Thought I'd be able to use navigate to see what public transport options were available but it seems that's not available until I'm actually in the city and on the trip. The main reason I purchased premium was to pre plan using public transport and being able to save the search and update it when I needed it. Want a refund please. | Awesome tool to get the lay of the land and top attractions while also being able to plan detailed daily itinerary | Great for organising trips very informative | Wonderful | App can't find the sites we already have mapped out on google maps. Waist of money, don't pay for premium. Maybe is you are only visiting big cities and like the places the app picks for you then you would be ok. I want a refund. | Good info | Best travel app, everything for your travel . Easy helpfull. Recommend for for traveller's. | Must have app for travelling | Very good | Good app | A great piece of software. You better use the browser version (!) of the app. You can create very detailed itinerary with routes to link your places of interest even by selecting foot, plane, car, public transport. After having xrewted your schedule you can download everything onto your phone and make holidays like a pro. For the paper generation there is even the possibility to export your trip with details and guides as pdf and print it. Thanks for the app, it's worth every penny. | Free version of the app is basically useless. The interface is also dumb. | Good n easy | Very nice and useful app | Change my travel planning experience | Why i cannot add my own place? Place that do not exist in the list? Im a premiun paid user. | It's working | Helpful | Have not yet fully test it but seems very promising. Thanks. | Very good 😊 | ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | Very usefull | I use this for all our travel plans to find neat and unusual places to see! | Very reliable. I planned all my trips with this app. | Love its | Good | have lots of attractions for u and great for planning the trips, it helps a lot | Excellent app and well worth a look at some of the out of the way places it brings up. Unfortunately after having zero problems it now cannot use maps even when downloaded. It just shows a straight line saying you are not online | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | Excellent travel application. I use this every time I travel. Keeps accommodation etc in one place | Waste of money. I could do more notepad | Awesome, love it. H | I planned a trip, but how to make it look like normal navigation? I cant it transfer to even sygic navi | Would be nice if you would inform users upfront that you have to pay for everything | Extremely versatile and i highly recommend for any one requiring work precision. | Nice to deal with you, thanks | Can't do anything until you PAY, but got EXACTLY what I needed from the Tripadvisor app, WHICH, by the way is FREE. Guess that's why there are a variety of apps available. | Works ok as an itinerary planner though adding your own personal private destination can be a bit clunky. It would be good if you there was a separate accommodation slot for each evening rather than including it in the day's places. Also when linking to sygic navigation, it doesn't work properly as it only shows you directions, not your ETA as you would normally see when mually loading a destination. Fix these issues and I'll happily upgrade the review 🙂 | Amazing apps for planning trips! | Incredible! Exactly what I wanted and more, Can't plan a trip without it! It's definitely my travel companion, Perfection! 😍 | Great for trip planning and finding new things! | Fantastic options to plan your trip! | Good | On Android 11 (Fairphone 4) the app is constantly crashing. It can't even start. Do you have some news on this? I am not able to use this app ... I just downloaded the app from apkmirror and it works. so there is something wrong with the version on Google play. | Amazing app. Help me whith trips site 2013. | Amazing. Super helpful and easy to use. Well never take another trip without it! | Saya mimpi pergi ke KL lalu telefon policenya Amira Kota Kinabalu Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre | Best Itinerary App EVER!! I love this app. I have used a few itinerary apps including visit a city and this is by far the best one. It's super versatile so, can add your own stops if they don't exist in the app, can download & use it off line & you can download your itinerary into a PDF to print and take with you or just keep as a souvenir/ keepsake. The only slightly annoying thing is when using the map offline, your position jumps around and you can't use it like you would google maps. | Maps downloads erroring out. Not able to use it effectively UPDATE 1: After trying out the steps provided by the developer, the issue is resolved. I am going to try out the app for a upcoming trip to evaluate it further. | Not worth the money,. regret the purchase. | All the tools you need to plan and to navigate abroad | ځواک ساتونکی | Not installed i use osmand+ | Useless without subscription | Easy tool to plan with | Not everything is up to date. But it helps to find lots of other places. I am recommending this app. Updates are added regularly | unable to synch with mob app. Waste of time setting up tons of places to visit...dont bother | Updated edit: I really like this app, use it so much that ive purchased premium. However, lately info seems to be a bit off. Especially attractions entry fees. The most annoying thought is that every 5 seconds there's a pop up saying that ""ive unlocked sygic"". It drives me crazy. My notifications are off. Could you please remove that? Thanks. | Was simply the best, offline GPS navigation application. Far, Far, superior to Google Maps BUT the latest update of removing the ""over speed"" advice. Replacing with change of speed ahead advice. Has removed a major reason for choosing this app above others. | Excellent | Excellent app for travel | This is a helpful app to plan a trip in the US, and then use it to navigate in countries such as France and Italy. Worth the money | Great app | Henüz denemedim ama şu an GPS yazılımlarında en iyi şirket Sygic hatalara devam etmesine rağmen, bu uygulamada başlangıç noktamı seçemedim çünkü listede yok! O yüzden yakın bir bölgeyi işaretledim | Not used | Good | 1.) Address search needs improving 2.) Adding my own location is buggy (cant add/disappear after trying to add) | Great travel planner. Needs improvement to add tickets and flights automatically from emails as other travel planners | Great | I just used 3 times, and I have no regrets about it. I would recommend for sure. | Love this, makes travel easy | Very close to useless, can't even import the trip using booking number | Confusing interface, difficult to actually make it do anything useful. | App is Ok | Thank you for your effort to keep it up . | 👍🏼 | Works for me. | Perfect | I just came across your app and found it to be awesome. However I feel there are some features you should add on the app for a more personalised experience *Notes - 1 should be able to add notes, reminders , or drop important links in the trip/or to a particular destinaton in the trip *Photos- It will personalise user experience, and your team will also grt great pictures to share. Again adding to a particular location & to the overall trip will be best *Location- users/Sygic can find new places | Very good app | Fun to explore by my fingertips. | Good app | Easy to use, helpful | Keep crashing. | Great for planning trips. Very intuitive and powerful features. Go for the premium - great Value for money | I used the free version on several occasions so I bought the premium feature. Now all the places on the map flashing so my eye hurt. People do something to make it gone. If I want to see sightseeing places , and put them into my itinerary I can't care less if the place is a park or a museum or a square even. Doesn't make sense anyway. | I love this app. It show you some places to go | Doesn't have the destinations that Tripit has. Try for example Grand hotel Reykjavik. Tripit found it in an instant. Sygic travel not. Sorry, but I'm uninstalling | The best travel plan I used | Very easy to use.. They have all the spots we wanted to hit plus have ideas for others. | Nice app | Good application. The main issue is with notes not being kept when a place is moved to another date. Otherwise a very useful program | Looks nice but is useless without subscription of 15 euros (lifetime). Uninstalled after 3 minutes | As soon as you leave the hotel (wifi) it doesn't work. The discriptions of places appaer sometime is Russian. I don't trust this app | HELP! How do I unsubsidized from this app, I don't want auto-pay to take another $24 from my account when this year is over. Apparently customer service isn't available through the app or online!? PLEASE HELP! | নাইস অ্যাপস | I hope if there are a specific places lists I made it myself | Best of its kind | I dont know what this app is good at... It is not as good as maps(free) and it doea not give any good advise... Useless | It's a subscription based service, and the free app is practically useless without it | Very good | Well functioning app | Very useful to plan a trip | The Android app is much better than Iphone for that reason I did not give 5☆ | E una presa in giro . Vi manda su google maps che funziona con la rete | Very helpful | Locked up my device. No maps to download. | I am using it during my recent travel and its helping me to find famous and interesting places to see in different tourists destinations. Thank you Sygic. | Everything is good. | Purchased premium because cooperation with Android Auto was problematic. Now with premium subscription I experience the same trouble in navigation view. To be more frustrated trying to cancel the subscription but it seems that function is well hidden somewhere. It seems that the solution is to refuse payment when it is due. Any help is appreciated. | THE DEVELOPER IGNORES EMAILS!!! ............I have not received any answer despite number of reminders... I just want to know how can I change the language of the Sygic Travel mobile app? On web I can change it to several languages, however in mobile app I don’t see such an option. I don’t’ want to change the language of my phone… I need to stay the phone language in English… | 2 advertising tracking api in the program. Update 5 tracking api | Very helpful | Ive used this for 3 trips to NYC. App did a fantastic job helping me when I had never been there before. however now as I'm planning one to Chicago, I'm noticing some issues. I don't recall needing to pay to view an image attached to a location. I'm big on architecture, but I can't see what anything looks like so I have to go back and forth between Google. Also, app is not up to date on establishments. Nearly every restaurant Ive typed in isn't in the app | Nice app | Purchased the app to compliment Sygic Navigation. It installed correctly but when attempting to open the navigation app it wouldn't open. It just gave you the option to close the app or contact customer support. Just what you need when abroad and your primary nav app no longer works. No way to back up routes or trips because of the failure to open,so all gone. Had to uninstall the app and reinstall and now have to download maps again. But all my favourites, routes and places gone. | Very nice | Since my review the app has been improved dramatically. Almost all my remarks have been considered and the features implemented and the performance improved.Now it is really an excellent app, so thanks to the team. I would suggest a couple of possibilities: 1. Recently, Triposo went down, it was good on grouping of cities, sightseeing, national parks etc, adding this feature would be great; 2. To integrate POIs from national parks guide; 3. Export as a table e.g excel file as an agenda for notes | I'd get premium if there's timeline/transportation method feature | Uygulama güzel fakat bi tuş olsa ve basınca bulunduğumuz konuma göre o günlük gideceğimiz yerleri en kısa mesafeye göre ayarlasa | After deleting it and reinstalling it, the download was successful, thank you. | I love this app I've used it to plan a week on Vegas and vermont..South Carolina and Galveston are planned. Makes it easy to plan all the things you want to do. Awesome! | Doesn't state that you have to pay $15 a month or more to use this! Too many free trip planners to be charging subscriptions for something people only use a few times a year. | Exceptional useful ap while planning travel. Makes maximising any trip a breeze as it highlights all things you would want to see and works out how much you typically spend there and travel distance and time to the next destination | Ok | Very good | Needs improvements, there is no link between the days. Also you can see the days i itinerary view but no info on the day unless you click into it. | Does not work for Vegas. You can't add a hotel to the itinerary without it thinking you are staying the night there. This is fine for most places but Vegas hotels are destinations | Very easy to use. I like the places feature. It shows you all of the major points of interest for just about anywhere. | Not useful app, better Google use it","{""1"":2292,""2"":352,""3"":529,""4"":1410,""5"":13049}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $29.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Tripomatic s.r.o.","4834904393905700904","team@tripomatic.com","https://travel.sygic.com","Tripomatic s.r.o.
