I was able to find a good cheap flight pretty easily and the price notification is also a handy feature. The \""scientific algorithm to buy tickets at a cheaper price\"" isn't always correct so just feel out for it and analyze yourself as it does give you a chart and a chart of probability. All in all I like more than Experian so this app is quite nice for finding good priced flights!"",""I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one."",""It's really mind-blowing how low of the prices the flights are for this app. What's even more amazing is the best deals seem to all come from this app. I've tried other flight websites and I stumbled upon you all, when I say absolute best prices that's exactly what I mean, especially if you are planning a trip in advance. Try it you won't ever be disappointed"",""I really like the kayak app.. it's great for finding prices for many different booking sites. The problem is the search error issue still hasn't been fixed after all these years. Sometimes when I search flights it will only pull about 10 to 20% of the results. Instead of kayak saying \""search error\"" it just displays the results with the majority of the flights missing. There's no easy way to get it to search again either, once it thinks it has all the results it just keeps showing the same."",""I find Kayak to have the most customizable flight alerts. It's still the only service I know of to offer flexible dates on searches. However, functionality is not great. For ex when i get push notifications for a low price, it doesn't bring me to the alert. I have to manually navigate to the saved search and sometimes i can't even find the low price i was alerted to.

It's also nice to be able to share the trip plan with others (either trip mates, or just family and friends so that they know where you'll be)."",""I tried a few commonly suggested itinerary apps before landing on Wanderlog. They have just about every feature you could want; I often found myself hoping a feature existed before checking & it would turn out to be already implemented! Understandably, a few are locked behind a subscription. I'm considering upgrading to Pro to support the team, but it's hard to justify because I only take such trips once a year. If there were monthly subscriptions, I'd seriously consider it! You guys rock!!"",""I rarely leave reviews, but so far, I'm very impressed. This is a really good app that consolidates all my travel reservations in one place. Airline, rental car, hotel, agenda, itinerary, activities, etc. It is so easy to import all of these loose ends by simply forwarding the confirmation emails to my profile. I did have to QC the details and make a correction, but it was all entered into my trip data, so even that was pretty simple. Great job with this.

There has only been one situation with an independently owned hotel that was booked and,upon arrival, in complete shambles. Absolutely nothing as the photos or description. After reporting this to Expedia, telling them we had found another hotel and had booked it, we asked if there was anything at all we could be compensated for. They gave a full refund by the end of the business day. I will always book through Expedia. Feels good to know they have my back!"",""The site has problems with displaying your benefits or any other details about your booking - it essentially doesn't really work properly and the funny thing is that if you want to cancel and you call them because nothing works on their website they tell you that no you cannot do it over the phone you have to do it via the website. I wouldn't trust my travel experience to such unresponsive/buggy app."",""The app has never let me log in with the correct credentials (which were double-checked on the website) despite updating the app to the most recent version... basically rendered useless. Edit: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works okay now. But it was definitely a cause for frustration upon my initial download."",""I can not use it. On entering my username, it sends me a code to my email and gives me 20 seconds to retrieve it. When I am lucky enough to get the code in time while traveling with low band width, it flashes a CAPTCHA and immediately gives an error message that something went wrong. When trying to log in with a password, I sometimes get a CAPTCHA that stays around long enough to answer, but it never accepts my answer. It's completely useless to me."",""I kept trying to log in and was met with a 6 digit id screen. When I tried to use the password instead (which had never been an issue in the past), it wouldn't log me in. Then I was met with a captcha....it has never been a this big of a hassle.

Purchased a package deal with flights, car rental and hotel. Flights were fine. Car rental charged us at pickup. Hotel had reservation booked under wrong first name and refused to let us have room. Came out of pocket yet again for new reservation as we had no choice. There is no way to contact booking for refund if you do not have a pin number which they never provided with original confirmation email. Will give same stupid response of contact us when there is no way."",""Hard to believe this is an editors choice app. Terrible app and customer service. If something goes wrong, you will get zero help. They just will send you the same message over and over and then do nothing. Special offer codes never work. Rates fluctuate while you booking. Fees and misc. charges are not fully disclosed or mentioned until check out when the price suddenly goes up . Cancellation policies are inconsistent."",""Booking has been there in times past when I needed them. Been mostly good experiences. Had a couple bad experiences but I have with other apps, too. None of them are perfect. So, I won't hold that against Booking. Some of the vendors were not doing good business. Booking provides the platform so I did not blame them. Booking has been easy to use and I trust the platform. Be wary of some vendors. That's what I will say. Keep traveling friends"",""Easy to use and great features. I've used this app for a year or two now and it's very convenient having all my bookings in one place, plus the more you use it the better deals you get! Even at the beginning the prices were comparable or better than other sites. No lags or errors. Can message hotels directly from the app. Great selection. Highly recommended. The service staff is very skillful to understand your problem and quickly come back with a solution within minutes or at most hours.""]",false,false,false,"com.booking","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.booking&hl=en&gl=us"

However, I'm disappointed to see a shift towards misleading offers and claims that don't hold up at booking. Deals that seem promising initially turn out to be different, with hidden fees and conditions not clearly stated upfront. I did call the customer service right after learning about the additional fees, and since the customer service was not helpful at all, I wrote this review!"",""I love this app! I recommend it to everyone that likes to travel. Especially if you're flexible with dates & even locations; we were able to get round-trip flights to Australia for $400! I love that Hopper updates you of your price fluctuations; it makes it super easy to book. A couple of times we needed to change flights (once was international) & because we had the insurance, they were able to get us squared away with new flights & refunded for price changes. Love Hopper, best travel app IMHO"",""We've been using Hopper for years to find just the right time to book a trip and to lock in the rates we've gotten. We've traveled internationally and locally booking through Hopper and have never had any problems. Great customer service when we've had pre-trip questions, unlike what you'd get with G**gle. Love the alerts for best prices on watched trips as well, it's saved us hundreds of dollars!"",""BAIT AND SWITCH!!! I purchased a flight labeled as comfort +. When I tried to pick my seats it was only Comfort+ for 3 of the 4 lags. Nowhere did it say this when I was purchasing. They took several days to \""research the problem\"". They called and left a message that they did nothing wrong and did not overcharge me. I had to spend an additional $230 to upgrade to the seats I already paid for. Do not fall for the price being a few $ less. SHADY BUSINESS STAY CLEAR! NOT WORTH A FEW $'S!!"",""I really like hopper, I moved from my home town to Denver about 4 years ago and they have been my default travel planner. For a 30ish year old person the integration and notification speed is helpful and I don't feel bothered by the app. It's come to my attention at other times I could have saved a small % more money using a competing service but often I feel the hopper cash and booking benefits outweigh those times. As well as connecting with Delta to get my skymiles.

I have reached high enough levels that it takes an extreme amount of energy to complete orders. I have also noticed with probulay 100 dollars worth of purchases to get to 60 like I am. The 2.99 purchase gets most then its like oh 4.99 or 5.99 ain't bad. But after all I have spent in the last 3 days the lowest costing energy is 7.99 and up. I would give 5 stars on this game because I am so addicted to it. But at this cost will have to delete it before my husband disown me."",""Travel Town is a fun matching game, but minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 8-10 matching items before it recharges again. You end up waiting than playing. Of course, you can use gems to speed process, but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Developers get rid of recharging. Thx"",""Travel Town is an enjoyable and challenging merge game. It is possible to play for free with zero ads if you choose. To reach higher levels spending reasonable amounts of money becomes necessary. As mentioned in numerous other reviews, daily tasks are very difficult to complete, but can be accomplished by: 1. Playing every few hours for 5 minutes at a time using your free, rechargable energy. 2. Pay for energy, diamonds and or items. I find the items fairly priced. Thank you for a fun game!"",""Only downloaded this to earn fetch rewards. It's fun enough and helps pass the time. I'm noticing what everyone else is saying about the items using ridiculously large amounts of energy, in turn taking a very long time to finish. I won't be spending money on this game, but probably would have played even after finishing the rewards if it wasn't for this issue. I'd rather watch a few ads here and there to earn energy points"",""Hope this gets better, I have played other games were you use energy. I want to see how far you can go without spending money. So far I've stalled a few times and I've just started. Need money to continue before you even get engrossed or excited about the game. You only get a couple of minutes play time before your stalled again. Just learning how to get more coins which is a plus.

You'll show up at the hotel or the rental car counter and your purchase won't be honored. After you reservation fails, you'll have to jump through multiple hoops to get a refund of you paid in advance. Avoid for last minute bookings."",""Their \""deals\"" are not anything that the hotel isn't willing to pricematch if you call them directly and ask for that price... doing this allows for a much more pleasant and helpfull customer service experiance. And as far as the APP vs the website goes...room pictures never work on the APP. I have to go to the website to view pics of the room I want. The app doesn't come with any extra discounts. Skip it. Delete it. Don't need it."",""The app works well, but the discounts suck. Also, they only give discounts while you're already vacationing, and by the time you're off vacation the discounts are no longer valid. I have a gold membership, but the benefits aren't worth the prices you pay for hotels. Their service fees while booking are also very high, so by the time you get a little hotel discount the service fee brings the price right back to the original hotel charge."",""I am IMMEDIATELY leaving a negative review. I booked a trip on the web browser. When I click print a pop-up about the app appears and will not go away. As soon as you book and it knows it, the web page becomes useless. So you are forced to get the app. Which I will promptly delete and never use Priceline after this trip is done. Back to Booking or Travelocity EDIT: IT GETS WORSE! download app. Create account. Finally get my trip added. Click details and this damn app just loads chrome !!!"",""I'll never use again. Booked a stay. And upon booking the travel 10 mins later decided to add days to my trip. The customer service on chat did not allow me to add time to my trip. I asked if I could cancel and re book with the extra days. They said no and I'd have to call the hotel to ask. They hotel says they do not deal with any third party reservations and are no help. I booked it 10 mins ago and was told any changes were to results in \""no show\"" fees of the entire cost of the booking.""]",false,false,false,"com.priceline.android.negotiator","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.priceline.android.negotiator&hl=en&gl=us"
