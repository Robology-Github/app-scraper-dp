From then on, I have not used any other trip planners. Wanderlog is easy to use and I like it that there are many fun recommended sights/places for the countries I travel to. I also love the Optimize Route feature as it helps me plan the itinerary more efficiently. In addition, the Customer Support was very prompt in answering my questions. Overall a great travel app! | Haven't used it for long but so far I am in love with the app, it has made it easier for my family to plan our trip and be able to all add things we would like to do and then organize everything | Free app optional to pay for extra service, easy to re-arrange the location with diff date, also can access it in web page too, happy with this app! | I am very pleased with the application. It serves my purpose well. I appreciate having everything in one convenient location. I can easily mark places I want to visit and view them on a map. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly. This application is an excellent tool for planning vacations. I have used it for my second vacation and will undoubtedly continue to use it in the future. | Would recommend! Very smart and convenient for planning the trip ahead | This app was great, allowed me to have all my travel plans in one place, very easy to use! | I love this app! Stay organized in one place! I used to use MS Word for all of the details but I love how Wanderlog automatically provides links and other info about all the places I have on my itinerary. I also like that I can make my own categories for other information. I'm using this app for four trips I'm in the process of planning and it's great. It's helpful for small trips of a couple days and two week long trips. | great tool for planning. organize evrerything in one place. Very flexible. easy to plan a road trip with many different stops. amazing amount of resources. | Well organized, easy to send info from my email confirmations, also updated expenses if included from reservations. Some interesting recommendations, easy to add places of interest to itinerary. Could be better in providing directions with options. | absolutely indispensable for trip planning! | Meh... Useless app with prev pay | Very useful to manage trips activities | Very convinient for planning a trip. It's quite laggy sometimes. Hope it will get better in the future. | easily captured all my trip details in one place! I could even refer back to the content that I forwarded if I had any doubts. | One the greatest tools ever for planning a trip. Ive used it on my 26 days trip to Japan and no other tool has been so usefull for planning and keep diary of all places we visit and wanted to visit! Its also incredibly easy to add things to your own planner from other peoples planners to easily build up your own Wanderlog 😉 | The perfect app for planning and organizing trips. | This app seems really cool but upon initial download, the amount of pop ups that show and redirects that the app does are incredibly distracting. I'll update the review as I use the app more however. | The idea is cool but the execution is poor. The loading time is long even though I have a pro account and offline access. In a good app this should mean loading and updating in background, but here is have to sit through seconds of loading on a high speed connection. Can't add regular transportation modes such as ferries to the planner. The auto-importer misses a lot and if you turn on Gmail auto-search it duplicates a lot. There are better products out there. | Great way to collect all your ideas for your trip then arrange them day by day. I really enjoy the map function to easily see where all your chosen attractions are located. | Useful app but lags a lot (I haven't seen this much lag in any other app) | A really useful app with a lot of options. Sadly it is pretty laggy on mobile and small things like swapping items on the itinerary from one day to another are error prone. The view on mobile can also get too cluttered, especially if you plan long trips with multiple stops. Also, it's sad that you can only purchase a yearly subscription to get premium features. Monthly subscriptions make way more sense for this type of app | great resource for planning | very helpful in planning a trip to a new place. It helps map your itinerary and shows many little things that help you complete your trip without thinking you missed something special. | I searched for a free app. This is not free. | I just found THE app for travelling! Amazing one-stop platform to put everything together, from flight details to lodging to places of interest... BONUS stuff: able to create notes, share with co-creaters, best routes, recommended places to go for dine and play... Thank you Wanderlog team for creating this awesome app! 😁 | The premise of the app is great and it has a lot of great features, but lately it has been extremely glitchy, for example the ""add"" button for new places to visit doesn't work for some sites no matter how much I press it, also the loading time is really frustrating. Today I made a new travel plan and painstakingly added more than 30 places to visit, only to find a few minutes later that the trip was nowhere to be found on my account :(( | I started planning a two week international trip with this app, so easy and intuitive. I love it and have recommended to friends who travel | awesome | This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used. it's just so well thought out. I am putting this at the top of the list of my favourite app. The web app is even better! | Really helpful to have all your travel information in one place! The explore page is great for inspiration and ideas. The interface can look a bit cluttered but once you familiarise yourself with it, it's really simple to use | I really love how this app organizes all your details. Especially love the feature where you email your reservations, and it plugs it into your iteniary! I attached screenshot of park passes, entered addresses, and it offers up other places to go and see. With a family of 7, I have to stay on top of every detail and reservation: Wanderlog makes that so easy! | I love this app! It's so easy to use, all your trip details in one place, easy to edit & manage agendas. It also opens the door to experiences you may have missed or overlooked by showing other points of interest, restaurants & experiences. I think they have covered everything you want to keep track of, all in one place! | excellent travel planner app | I stumbled on wanderlog a while ago and saw an amazing opportunity to use it for my trip to Korea. It was really easy to use, the interface was good. For me the best feature is the ability to have a map that shows the distance from one place to another. All in all I will definitely use this app again. So amazingly easy to plan for a trip. | Good idea and app but you will get tons of ""ads"" for hotel etc. But the Pro price is exactly what's wrong with todays subscription model. It's a travel app and the only option is to pay for a whole year, and it cost almost €60 (!). I also get a more expensive price in the app when i'm logged in than what their website say (€50). €60/year for Pro that most people will use for offline mode and attachments is crazy. Better to pay for e-sim. | La mejor aplicación para planificar viajes nacionales e internacionales. | I used the free version to plan my upcoming 1 month solo trip for Europe. Is a very good app which help me plan my itinerary easily and handy!! I even introduce my sister to use this app and she love it. | This app is not free, it is $50 per year after they collect data. I don't mind paying for an app, but don't lie. | awesome app! just what I was looking to plan our trips. full feature and very easy to use. | I have been the designated trip planner for our friend group for almost 10 years now. I have used apps like Tripit, Google Travel, splitwise, Citymapper, you name it! Once I found Wanderlog, I deleted all other apps. Wanderlog is all these apps combined into one!! And it's virtually glitch free. We recently took a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. Planning and executing has been a breeze. The developers have thought about every possible scenario. Budget summary could use some fine tuning. | Amazing app with all the features I need for planning trips. I shared with my family, friends, and today with coworkers. Looking forward to improvements as this app progresses. | absolutely love this app, I use it to keep track of places and things I want to see and also use it to log my trip as a trav journal! | Nica app. But it has many functionalities missing from the free version . | Fabulous app that has been so valuable in coordinating our trip. Everything you need is right here! AAA+ | Great tool to help plan and navigate our trips | Good functionality but I find the constant 'helpful' popup tips very grating. I think they are a good idea but the fact that it forcibly changes what's displayed on the screen and drags you away from what you were trying to do is too intrusive and instead of reading then I've just been clicking them away - hopefully I'm almost through them all now. Also maybe a personal preference but I find the text and interface a bit too zoomed in/not dense enough, maybe there could be a setting for this? | Great app for travel planning. Has the ability to add places, notes, etc. A great all round travel app | LOVE being able to share the trip itinerary with others. LOVE being able to easily re-arrange the things I've selected to do. LOVE multiple sources to find best of the best w regard to dining, etc., Can't wait to try it LIVE!! | this is a great system and can even quickly start navigation in rental cars. | really like this app. helped with planning | Excellent app, has made it possible for me to plan complex trips overseas and keep organized | I organised my Kyoto trip with the help of Wanderlog. I had an amazing good time. Now I am planning my next trip in July. Thank u Wanderlog. | I moved to Wanderlog from TripIt because of the clean, modern interface of the application and the website. I also like the map feature where it plotted on the map all you lodgings. Customer service was responsive and fast. Overall this great apps helped me on my 5 weeks trip to South America with many flights, hotels, car rentals and activities.AI integration looks promising as well. | Really good app very helpful to be notified when places will be closed | I love this app! It made trip planning so much easier to have everything in one spot, and so intuitively. Very user friendly and helped by allowing me to research options and have them pulled up in advance | Great Planning Tool | User unfriendly. Can't search within trip. Useless. If I could give less stars, I would. | this app has been amazing for planning my trips. absolute life saver so easy to use | Just used Wanderlog to plan my vacation and it was fantastic! Highly recommend giving it a try. | Amazing tool to plan and organize your trip. Saves a ton of time. There's a lot of room for improvement, but what they've got is worth 5 stars for how useful it's been. | Very good for travel planning. Easy to use. | I love the ability to organize to the level available even in the free version. Looking forward to what features and functionality are available in the paid version. | Powerful organizer for travel plans. | After much researching, I decided to give Wanderlog a go and it was pretty neat. A lot of things can be synced by forwarding hotel and flight emails, adding the cost of individual places / activities / food, adding links etc. The itinerary makes the trip easy to navigate, way better than Spreadsheet 🤭 So, thanks Peter Xu! For creating this wonderful app. I've started using for my next trip with my girlfriends :) | Very good apps for travel. My whole trips is plan well because got the Wonderlog, very helpful. | Great travel planning app with new features added regularly. | brilliant, everything is in one place, I love it | I have used Wonderlog for many of my trips. | The app keeps crashing on some places of the map view. I thought it was depending on the number of places I had added but then I realized this was not the cause. I also found quite annoying to add notes in the Itinerary view. Considering this is a touristic app, you should add other payment ways to buy the subscription as I tried to do it from the Google Play Store and because their country limitations I wasn't able to do it. | Too many pop ups, even after disabling tips. Would be nice to have a calendar view of itinerary as well as a download to excel or pdf function. | so far, to help on planning it has been helpful. it aggregates the info from my mails | a great app to consolidate travel details into a single itinerary. It's especially handy when you use multiple platforms to book flights, accommodation, tours and train/car travel as it's easy to check that booking dates are correct. | Not for me too nosy and seems to want to take over I installed Thanks | good and nice | I've only used it for a few days, but so far everything works great! It's great to be able to gather all the details of a trip in one place instead of searching email and texts and saved documents. | Great features | I love this app! I'm that person who is the planner of the group and always has a Google Sheet. I LOVE the organization/the mapping functionality of this app & the ability to have different ""layers"" of the map so I can see locations for different days or purposes (a map showing me everything I want to do! or a map showing me all the restaurants I'm considering! So helpful). Also love emailing the app to auto populate hotel reservations and train/flight reservations onto the itinerary!! | While not perfect, this is the best travel app I've tried so far. Great way to organize my itinerary, get directions, see suggested stops, and more. I'll keep using it! | Best travel planning app ever. | Very good App. Useful when you want for city break's with many things to, like Paris | love this app, planning a trip to Hawaii, this was a great help to keep track of everyone's tickets and itinerary. Bravo! | Extremely helpful. It's now one of my favorite apps. We just got back from a four day weekend, and it was fantastic to have all the information in one place. No more searching through email and texts to find information about your next stop. Directions are ready with just one click. We are planning a longer vacation in August. As I make reservations or book flights, I just forward the email to the app. The info will be right there when I need it. Great for detailed planners and for casual trips. | Would've been a great travel planning app, but I had lists just disappear without any explanation and have to remake them again. Will reach out if it happens again. | UPDATE: Plus one star for responding and at least attempting to fix the issue. Pro version still very expensive and a poor value, especially when their system burps at inconvenient times. Garbage app. Made the mistake of purchasing Pro. It won't automatically add vrbo's or other similar bookings and won't let you forward emails or enter bookings manually either. TripIt here I come. | wonderful tool, forever evolving, like travel itself, to make it easier, more intuitive and indespensible. | UNINSTALLING - Was given the impression that this app was free compared to competitor apps that are ""overpriced annual subscriptions"". This also has an annual subscription price, which is required in order to do anything in the app beyond the 7 day trial. $70 for an app to plan a budget friendly road trip... talk about ironic. | AI is fairly accurate and the recommendations are legit. I hope to see more exclusive deals to justify the subscription. | Best App for Traveling | organizing my trip in a couple of weeks and I'm already in love. THIS is exactly what I needed to sort out distance, opening hours and other things that would stress me out if I didn't have the details all laid out in a concise, neat way. | Offline access behind a paywall? LOL. Thats a new one. That means there's no acceptable free version as many trips you can end up with poor or no connectivity. | Really difficult to separate free from paid pro app. There is no activities/tour tab in this app, which makes it useless for me. The graphics are beautiful. I like the way it pulls in suggested activities and shows the map but without an activities... | This is a great app for travel planning. I found several spots I would have missed and I loved being able to plan out our days with travel time estimates to avoid packing to much in to a single day. | incredible product. what would take me several sites to research and plan can now be done on one site lots of features and simple to use | Excellent! It's the most complete and intuitive app available. 100x better than spreadsheets, helps you to keep track of expenses, and also suggests attractions you should go to during your trip. I love it! | Stuff of nightmare. Pop ups everywhere. So many screens, sections, buttons, navigation, suggestions, recommendations, automation. OMG cannot understand a bit. Started with paid version. Then immediately uninstalled, phew. What a relief. | have added 21 stops and it works great, love it so far. | easy for group travel collaboration. Great tool! | This is a great way to plan my trip! | Travel planning for a family of 4 is tough but Wanderlog made it feel intuitive. We were able to plan for multiple cities with multiple hotels like a breeze. It uses other popular productivity tools to superpower the mapping and itinerary information as well. I'm thinking about going pro because of the quality. | so easy to navigate | I'm not much of a trip planner, but I recently took a trip to South Korea, and this app was a life saver. It was really easy to use, and I loved how flexible it was. You can plan an itinerary and upload travel documents to it. It gives you recommendations of where to go/see and includes a map with the route you planned on your itinerary. It is a stress free app with so many cool and helpful features that I will for sure use this app again for my next big trip! | Amazing app and I haven't even tried to paid version yet. I'm usually an extensive Google doc planner but this app makes it so much easier! The organization is so helpful and visually pleasing. It makes it so much easier to see the full picture without having to scroll scroll scroll | the best so far for travel plan. Prefer if it's not too cluttered. Some locations can't be added into the itinerary, don't know why | awesome for managing your holiday especially when you're doing multiple cities or countries | The app has many really great features, but unfortunately I sometimes find myself still going to email app or Google Maps, because of performance. It takes about 8 seconds on my phone between tapping the app in the launcher and (no interaction) seeing my itinerary' today view. | service is great, but the app freezes/stalls pretty regularly. Could use some UX improvements for the rearranging process on mobile too | I mostly used the app to save destinations that I wanted to visit. It was good to just come back to the app when I was in Boston to look at my points of interest to visit on the fly. | I travel a lot and this particular app is great as it pulls all of my information in and if it is unable to, it allows me to add it to my itinerary. It sorts all of my travel, lodging, tours, etc. I can add attachments, map locations, Transit cards, | I used Wanderlog to plan a 10-day trip to Italy, covering Venice Florence and Rome. The app is a great way to organize the trip plan in one place, and while on the trip, to navigate from place to place through links to Google maps. Fantastic tool if you like to be organized and plan out daily itineraries. | Great app for uploading itinerary. The dates and activities could be better formatted. I love the uploading confirmation emails to the app for it to automatically update the page. Also, love the trip recommendations. So useful. | amazing | WOW! This is a fun, very easy and useful app to use. I'm still testing and am planning our itinerary for an upcoming vacation. Wish list: 1. Add a search function so that I can find things in my overview, itinerary and notes. 2. Add export function to Google Calendar. 3. The expense sharing function does not handle changes in currency. | Excellent tool, even though the importing part can be improved...it helps a lot to organize and visualize your trip | just try whoa its blow my mind its a great app | cool planner | Awesome application easy to use and very informative 👍 | really helped plan our trip to Japan with 4 other people. made it super easy to see people's suggestions and then make an itinerary with it | Installing app for the first time. Also I am not able to skip the subscription page. I don't need the features which come with the subscription. I just want to use the free version. Even if I click the X on the top-right, I return back to the previous screen. I simply don't want to leave my credit card info. | so far so good. | Good apps! | I'm so glad this app exist | The app has a nice user experience and you can insert everything you need in one place. I don't know if it's my phone but sometimes it gets slow to use and i have to wait for the command that I get. | LOVE THIS APP! Organize places by type and see places or itinerary on the MAP! So helpful in planning, and sharable itinerary ❤️ I will be using Wanderlog for all of my trips moving forward!! | This is my 3rd time using this app for my trips. Easy to use. Recommended. | The functionality is good but the app feels slow and clunky when you move things around. Itinerary view is not easy to scroll and you can't just move from places to visit to the itinerary section. | Love this app! Makes trip planning so much easier! The only thing I'd ask for is if they could add Naver Maps for Korea, because it's almost impossible with Google Maps, some of the restaurants or cafes you want to go to don't exist. But apart from that, it's a great app! 👍 | Overall a great app to really help plan and group things. However the app is quite clunky at times, especially when wanting to ""rearrange"" places or notes around. It scrolls back up to the top and sometimes holding and dragging the item gets laggy and becomes annoying. I would use it again but these small things could do with some improvement! | Excellent app! This app was a huge help when planning my big trip to California with my friends. This app made it so easy to plan all the travel destinations we were planning on going. This app has so many good features like offline maps and adding hotel and flight reservations. I love all the features it has and I highly recommend this app! | Very easy to add places and rearrange. I would have enjoyed a longer description of the landmark was attached to each site. Each day was color coded which was very helpful. | helped to group activities together | First time using app. Will never travel without it again. Fun, interactive way to trip plan. Instant win. | absolutely fantastic app. I use it for all my trips | Very good app with a lot of great features to help plan your itinerary | Helpful to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip from flight, rental car, places staying, coordinating activities and restaurants. This was especially helpful for preplanning with a traveller with Celiac disease. | Very easy to use, and incredibly convenient. | very comfortable and helpful! | Nice and easy to use. | awesome | love the app. been using it for the last 4 months to prepare/plan for our family trip in June. it's cool you can budget everything out, add hotel reservations, attach event tickets, and split the budget up if needed. searching the map feature for things to add to your itinerary is so much fun! | Very nice and easy travel planner 👌 | It can't find any cities to Start | This is a wonderful, full featured travel planning app. It is making an extended trip so much easier for my whole family to keep track of. Thank you so much for creating this indispensable tool! I didn't need to pay for the subscription to make great use of this app, but I did (after finding the app so helpful while planning) for my own benefit, yes, but also in thanks to support the developers. I highly recommend this app. | Always a Pop-up window open, can't use it | I'm so glad this app exists. It's better than just writing down a list of places you want to go. However, sometimes when you type stuff in, the screen lags for a second. It's not terrible, but it's still pretty annoying | it was good for planning my trip and make a lists of places | Great concept and tells the user how long it takes to get to their next destination, but the app keeps crashing. I've lost a couple of places I've saved too. Good to start with but best to keep a personal copy with an excel sheet or something | it's very neat! perfect for planning any range of trips | this app is so helpful! everything is in one place. Flights, car rentals, hotels, and your itinerary! | Good concept and has some nice features. However, the UI is SO overcrowded with elements and information I actually got stressed at some point. Maybe squash the bottom side buttons into an expandable/collapsible menu? Hide the summary description for places to visit unless expanded? Shrink the date under the itinerary tab, why must it take 20% of an almost 7"" screen?? Overall nice app, but the UX does need some work to make it a bit more simplified.

Personalization of design could be improved | so far so good | I dont see any benefit to pro. It seems a lot to pay just for flight notifications. We already get that from the airline. I would like to be able to add more than 3 photos/pdf so that everything is in one place. It's a little archaic not to. Also, it's a trip planner, add a packing list. Again, so it's all in one place. This is my 1st time using this app and I'm travelling in 11 days. I'll edit when I return! | ""Error: saving failed. Please try again"". CONSTANTLY. Duplicating plans to different trips changes the trips' dates automatically, even after editing the duplicated plan to reflect new dates. Mass-editing still not possible after a decade plus. Amateurish effort and a childish attempt by intuit to hoover data. | Paid for the Pro which has some benefits like adding travel documents and updated gate alerts, but whenever my airline sends me updated flight times (which seems to be frequent) , it adds the updated flight as a new flight and then I don't know which leg of each trip is the new or old and I have to delete the whole trip and start new. Very frustrating. Updated to add it used to be better at forwarding emails and automatically inputting information. Half the time they go to unfiled documents now | Great way to organize a trip with multiple people planning, numerous hotels and stops, and flying more than one airline. | great app for planning | If you travel for business or pleasure, this would be a very useful addition. It take organizing to a new level. | soooo handy, highly recommended | Excellent travel companion. The stuff you need, in a simple presentation, and that's it. | fab app to get all your travel plans organised and in one place | Awesome | Perfect for long trips, especially when a lot can change 🙂. | A great place to hold all the details of your trip. | I've been using this app for 13 years and I find it to be one of the most useful apps on my phone. I'm planning another trip and Tripit correctly and safely stores my itinerary. Love it. | Super helpful and easy to use. Everything in one place, straight from your mails, no need to do much. | so easy to use and a great, clear itinerary display | very good tool to manage trips and hwt regular updates | trip it keep all the travel and hotels together. Very practical. | Tripit Pro is the best way to get organized and then stay dynamically organized as your trip progresses. | I have used TripIt for multiple trips, and I appreciate how it keeps us on track with our schedule. I also like that I can share the itenary with others. I would, however, like to see both a start and end time on the main page. | it's a great traveling tool. | Fun to track it all. | Doesn't connect to email like it used to. Harder to use. Used to so smooth and seemless, not anymore. | I love having all of my reservations in one place with addresses, reservation numbers, contact info and anything I could need while traveling. I can also share the itinerary with people that are traveling with me. | Have used and loved it for years. In 2024 the airport maps no longer display but give an error message saying there is a bug. Very inconvenient. Deducted a star. | great app!!! very useful to organize your trip!!!!! | For hotels during the trip, the timeline view only shows the start and end day of the accommodation. We need to show our colleagues ""where to stay"" each day after a busy day full of events. This was requested since 2016 and still not considered in a so called ""trip planner"" app. Any project planner like MS planner, Trello can easily duplicate the element and distribute them on each day as a column. Optionally, a packing list should be made available as a trip planner | Very useful information in one place. | great app | Useless, unless you pay for a subscription | Does the basics and allows to better organize a trip for easier visualisation, but could use some improvements. - Interface is OK but not great. It can be a bit confusing to use at first. - Does not allow to share trips with friends for reasons unclear that even support can't say. - I considered the pro version but I can't really understand what the benefits are apart from flight notifications, which I already get with my airline app for free. | Excellent app | Won't sync with outlook | Great, except the incorrect time display | Unable to create account. Keep getting ""use a strong password"" message when my password is 14 characters long with upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. Frustrating. | Love how it organises everything for you. | I use Tripit for ongoing and complex trips lasting 6 months and more. It is a really good tool for identifying errors in my booking process. | it keeps surprising with features that pop up that I really appreciate | loving the simplicity and organization | so helpful | Can't connect to travel partners. Entering account information for car rental accounts, hotel accounts, and airline miles accounts is useless. TripIt doesn't effectively sync with any of them to pull current rewards information. | only with limited photos to upload | Really great way to keep all dates and bookings in one place and to share with multiple group members. | This app is awesome! It keeps all of my itinerary in one place. It even gives a safety score for where you're staying. Perfect job | Regularly logs you out and hangs when doing offline syncing so had to uninstall it as of March 2024 | Where has this been all my life??? | just downloaded. just what I was looking for | Invaluable tool for any traveler. | wowwwww, its a powerful tool 😎 | The app will not let me sign in. It's tells me my password isn't valid. But I can log in on a browser with that password so clearly it is the right password. This is insane. | I have been using for years. very convenient to have your flights, hotels, trips etc all in one place. | The best travel management app I've ever used had only one issue (processing non English bookings). Other than that, it is an excellent app | Really was looking forward to accessing this app on a trip. Now, I cannot log in, I cannot change password. Error message reads: Unexpected error occurred... What if this happened during trip? Useless app.... Uninstalled... Resolved previous issues. Apparently my device was updating apps at the time and a glitch occurred when I tried to log in to TripIt. After updates completed, I was able to change my password and update my trip information. Apologies to team TripIt. | Amazing app | I love how it creates your trip schedule so easily! | easy to organize complete trips | Great app to plan your trip. Gets updated from your email confirmations automatically so you have all your trip info in one place | Love how helpful status updates are! Best travel planner! | will let know once | great way to keep all of your travel information in one place. | awesome travel organizer | I think this is a scam it asks you for your date of birth and where U live straight away and it barely made any plans for me I had to do it myself and you have too pay $80 a year | I really love having this app. It helped me plan my recent trip to Canada. I haven't had to pay anything to use it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a schedule on vacation! | Great Way to Store Travel Info | best app for tracking all information for your Trip | it is a great trip tracker. I've been using it for years. | Tripit is a lifesaver, helps with all my travel planning so much! | Better help for me!!!! | This app truly works, easy to upload plans via email or email scan. Organize each trip by date, title. | Unable to sign in | helps with keeping everything together, great for collaboration too | Login page itself has bugs and would not show up proper error messages. I was trying to login but it is not letting me in even when I entered credentials multiple times. | What a great app to keep my plans and my memories in order. | love the app. | Makes travel so much easier - love it! | Best App | I was nervous about this app until I learned that my best friend uses it. He is constantly in motion and tripit keeps him organized -- I hardly ever travel but I'm planning a trip right now and I'm making it as complicated as humanly possible and there is no way I could do this were it not for tripit. Thank you for creating this amazing app! | very useful keeps things in order | Best at Pro | Great trip planner. Could have costs added to the plan. | Great app for keeping your travel plans updated and readily available | The best, most thorough, and user friendly app. Easily updated, and easy to use. I've used it happily for many years. It's always improving. The layout and trip events are very practical to check daily events. Excellent app | DeLand. FLa. 3. Bedrooms. Houses. 32720. Front. & back. Yard. Pool | Latest update causes immediate crash. Now fixed | Couldn't even get in, would let me select home city at sign up. I entered my nearest home city and it just kept saying enter city, tried other cities too but nothing. | Garbage. Created account from corporate concur link. In the app, it doesn't recognize the password I just created 5 minutes ago. Try ""forgot password"" and it refuses any new password I try. Going back to paper. | Useless | Cannot share trip with another user. Previously no problem. | awesome app. can't wait for more features and interfaces | so farvitvis a game changer for our team. we have lots of moving parts and this has been very helpful mapping out our trips. | Calendar should start with dates that are within your trip dates rather than today's dates. Would be nice if we could export to excel too. | HORRIBLE NOW!! This used to be a wonderful app. Now, password won't work, no reset link ever sent. Can't sign up with new account, constant errors. Other, better apps available!!! Don't waste your time with this one. | Wrong dates scanned from trip confirmation email. Attempted to correct manually, errors in app editing interface do not allow saving of correct info. Uninstalled. | Doesn't even work properly. Duh | I love the idea of this app. The first few items uploaded great but none of my flights are syncing up even though the app says they are. Hopefully it's just a bug and it's fixed soon because I think this app really has potential. If you could export to a cvs or cvv for spreadsheet that would be amazing | New version won't let me sign in. | Very helpful while travelling , and you have a busy schedule | ever since giogle stopped trips, I have been lost. trip-it saved me | Lets have an app scan your entire mailbox for 'just your travel data' aha ... Because that's bound to end well, with the inevitable data breach... | Works well. Easy to use. | excellent | ❤️ | Doesn't work at all anymore. Can't even login, keeps giving me an error | great | Must improved since last I rated it two stars in 2017. It however has slipped again. My properly imported rental car plans always randomly change between filed and unfiled. This makes things difficult when using the widgets | Too many bugs | Great for documenting your confirmations for airline, car rentals, dinner reservations, but not for planning a trip. I was hoping this app would replace Roadtrippers for me. | used it once before and found it again. worth the money for the pro version | Love the fact that you can make a very detailed itinarary with a visual timeline that makes it easy to keep track of everything. | THE BEST travel organiser app. | Best app 👌 | Everything I book or event attended is added to Tripit for future reference. | Very helpful in keeping track of everything on a trip in terms of flight status and hotel confirmation. I've been using it for years and never had any problems. | Impressive but not perfect. Need to add feature of more than one email address because not all my travel info goes to the same email address. | The app has been great but just stopped working. When I try to log in it just says access denied | great product keeping all travel details together | No search function (iOS has it). Flighty level details would be nice. They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world 🌎 and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers.","{""1"":1703,""2"":680,""3"":1363,""4"":11376,""5"":65321}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$48.99 per item","10","10","VARY","TripIt, Inc.","TripIt,+Inc.","support@tripit.com","http://www.tripit.com/","601 108th Ave NE

My Trips have been ruined. I was quite happy planning my trips by days. Who the hell knows what day e.g 18th June is without looking at a calender! | Everything great so far, I may increase rating as as king within the first 5 minutes of opening the app doesn't allow for much user experience | Easy to complete. | Does everything it should and also well. I also enjoy the layout and never had any problems | Wonderful hotel | Lots of options. Details of tours, locations, attractions.

Highly, revommend using. | Easy to use 👍 | Good customer service | Excellent app for tours all over the world 🌎 | Genuine reviews which help decide your trips and hotels. The app should be more user-friendly and provide suggestions based on last searched | Use the app before we book any vacation | Good travel review guide | Nice apps If you want come to Zanzibar don't hesitate to contact me Ibra Taxi Driver Zanzibar 🙏👍 | Absolutely fantastic | Taxi Service 🚖 | Details from locals, immensely helpful | Con l'ultimo aggiornamento la funzionalitá per programmare itinerari di viaggio spalmati su giorni é peggiorata tanto:non c'é più la possibilitá di vedere la mappa coi luoghi filtrati per giorno,non c'é più la possibilitá di vedere la lista dei luoghi non ancora assegnati ad alcun giorno,per aggiungere un luogo ad un giorno devi scorrerti tutta la lista di luoghi inseriti perché il pulsante per aggiungerne di nuovi é stato messo in fondo alla lista,i filtri by category non ha effetti sulla mappa | Vety good | Very nice app for recommendations | Fantastic operation...well done! Enjoyed very much | Good. More filters would make it great. | Good location. Extremely clean and comfortable hotel and rooms. Excellent breakfast. | Very helpful in finding fun things to do | Very helpful and good for advice | Good | Great app | Nic | TripAdvisor is my trusted go-to app when traveling or planning travel. The customer reviews of restaurants and activities are a trusted resource. | I've discovered it's freezes at different places. Sometimes using the A.I, Sometimes not. Doing regular searching | I do not know how I managed before I started using TripAdvisor | This app is so good | The app refuses to go online. Despite every other app working and my internet being fine. Have tried reinstalling it a bunch of times and this has been a problem for months. | Excellent and easy to use. | Why is all the prices coming up pound instead of us dollars. Everything looks interesting but I can't book cause I don't know the correct price | The app is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Highly recommended. | A helpful App to find restaurant destinations | Very good and Imformative | Interesting reviews | Great platform for review | I used to use tripadvisor to plan my trip exclusively. But the update in Dec ruined the whole experience. First, the map next to itinerary on the desktop version is too small to be useful. Secondly, trip planning function becomes too painful to use because there is no way to tell which saves have or have not been added to a itierary. Third, why they never build a simple tab that could archive old trips or sort trips alphabetically. | Very best app | The Trip Advisor app works consistently well and is great app experience!The Trip Advisor app is fun to use,is very helpful!Trip Advisor always works like it should! It's always a pleasure to suggest,advise and share information with others that would be helpful.They post info quickly to help others make good,educated choices!The pictures posted always look crisp!

Thank you Teddie | Dreadful and you can't download your tickets | App is terrible, bought a great offer but the app constantly asks me to sign in, when I do it often just takes me back to the sign in page with no messages why. Scrolled through the app, requested to sign, I did but I don't think it was successful, then tried to add a favourite activity, had to sign in, was asked to make a list, went to create a list, app say opps can't do that now try again later, try again, asked to sign. Quick note I did sign in each time it asked but it never seemed to work | Constantly asks to re-login, never succeeds | Impossible to stay logged in. Logs in and shows my account for a millisecond before asking me to log in again. Tried multiple devices, apps, accounts, everything. Customer support said they didn't have the resources to troubleshoot it and the promo code only works on the app. Excellent way to get every email I own signed up to your service, I suppose.

Like the terms as well. | Easy to find and book tours. | Perfect ap | Easy Peasy | The activity provider/trader mislead using pictures and description that scams you. so please check what your activity provider does. and they blame the app for not giving them an option. | We should be able to edit our review after submiting it. I started a review, than stopped for doing something else and then i wasn't able to finish it. | Had to cancel and rebook my reservation because I didn't choose accommodations. The customer service was excellent. Great job and thank you. | All is easy to pick, to reserve, to pay | Awesome | was never able to complete a single purchase, error code 100 whatever before making payments... costumer service is useless and asked personal information like last for digits of credit card, date of birth etc... and 3 days later never heard from them it seems like a big personal information collector scheme or a scam. beware | I have used get your guide in 4 cities in the past 2 weeks, the app is great for keeping all the info I need close at hand. | Lots of options, easy to book | Love the app, makes it so easy make tour bookings | Great app when looking for adventures traveling alone, or in group! | Easy booking and very detailed descriptions that live up to in reality. | Booked two great guided tours through this all 1 Vesuvio and Pompei . 2. Napoli sotto terra EASY !!!!! PEASY!!!! | Value for money on all your travel needs | Gives lots of info and easy to use. | solid and secure | So user friendly 👍 | Everything works. | Easy and excellent | Pointless app. Extremely fed up of companies thinking they need an app when a simple email will suffice. After booking my tour I received an email saying I would need the app to access the activity. So I had to download and install the app. But all the information was already in the email. I didn't need or use the app at all, and the tour company never once looked at it. Have now uninstalled on return home. | So fast! | A great choice of trips and things to do,very easy to use | I was told that the app was required for the trip. Using the directions took me to the wrong location, and I almost missed the boat. When I tried to board the boat using the QR code in the app, I was turned away and forced to go get a paper ticket. | Quick and easy to use | So far, so good. Search and booking functions are easy to use. | The support team awesome, I been surprised how they are very helpful and kind. | It's so great to not have to worry about making arrangements once you get on your vacation! | Great for finding local experiences at a competitive price | Uncooperative customer support | Awful. Did not work, support was useless, AVOID. We bought this, headed to the first location and that was it. No riddles, no next destination suggested. Support just kept saying to head to the first location and solve the riddles which was no help at all. Still no idea where/how to access the riddles and locations. Ruined the day, as we had no other plan and ended up seeing nothing. Don't waste your money. | Complete information, trusted reviews | I downloaded the app, and promocode didn't work. Felt cheated. On entering code, it kept giving a msg, ""code expired, ok got it."" Very unfortunate way to make people download the app and not living up to the promotions offered. | Love the ease | Easy to find tors and quick booking | DO NOT USE THIS APP. THEY CHARGE MORE FOR MAJORITY OF ACTIVITIES. | Lots of great choices and great service | Use the app and reserve everything all in one place. Super easy!! | Very easy and convenient to use | Great App Would recommend 👌 | I've reserved activities with GetYourGuide twice now, and the first time we had a problem with the people from the activity itself. So GetYourGuide refunded us the whole amount. Very happy with their offerings and prices. | Great | Unable to transfer my bookings into the App, tried multiple times. | Seamless | I like to book here because it's more specific on the activities they offer and I cannot say more until I experience the actual activities. | Good app for tours. Sadly it doesn't allow posting photos and videos along with text only tour reviews. | Excellent service | Great | Fab app for trips/days out. Love it | Easy to use and navigate! | This app is a total SCAM. Don't ever use or download it. They lie in their advertisements and don't refund you. They also discriminate against disabled people and don't accommodate for them despite saying they do. They robbed me of almost $300 for a tour that didn't even go where they said it would and that didn't accommodate my disabled father when we were willing to only do part of the tour. That only cost 30. Ridiculous and disgusting customer service. | Good | Very helpful during our Europe trip for 2 weeks to visit all the Must-See places and tours. | Easy read and clear instructions | Great experience | Easy and fast | Should have a loyalty programme by now. It's been far too long. | It was okay at first, until I was told that ""if you have a purple ticket to see the eclipse, you can"". One, I didn't have one and two, get your guide never told me or had a special discount of that event. Tbh, it's not worth it. Never again. | Good and easy | Great app . . . So easy | Great program, great app. Puts all my side trips in one place. Easy to navigate | Break up details of transactions are not available on the app after booking tickets. Transaction amount shows 63$ CAD and at the end it charges 94$ CAD. It is like decieving customers and not providing full informarion. | Love this app! Makes bookings so easy! And with reliable tours in so many countries | I contacted operator through email and watsapp phone to cancel activity (Land of legends).However I did not get refund. This is my first time using get your guide and will certainly be my last time.On website they say they will refund your money if you cancel 12 hours before but that's not the case. | The app is not only really fun and easy to use, but their customer service is superb. I had a complaint, and they took it really seriously and solved it effectively. | Fabulous....very easy | Great App for booking | App has nice feature that allows you to access vouchers without WiFi. | Esay and reliable app. Extremely convenient during travel. | All tours provided have been excellent quality, easy to book and all necessary details for tours provided for easy access. | Very helpful | One of the worst experiences I've ever had was when I bought a ticket to visit the Louvre. Upon arrival, I was not allowed entry because what I had was a voucher, not the actual ticket required for entrance. Attempts to contact the company through emails and phone calls were never answered. Please try it before you decide to use this app. In general, I do not recommend this app at all. | Great experience so far!! | Tell me why do I need to install your app to view the tickets I bought? Surely the tickets can be sent over email. Horrible way of stealing people's data by masking that within the app you can 'change' or 'reschedule' bookings. Do better. | Made booking activities for my trip very convenient | Used this app several times all over the world. Everything a good experience. Highly recommended. | Easy, reliable travel activities - anywhere!!! | Great app have used it multiple times | Pervious tours in Vienna and Berlin were wonderfull and stress free because we booked in advance. | Great deals.. Great experiences 👏 | Great and easy way to enjoy places you are. It would be better to have verifications so tours with no shows are reduced | Works well and user friendly interface | Absolutely hopeless I made and paid for a booking and I cannot find it, too hard to navigate website | Easy to use | Great | I've used this app to book a lot os different tour in different cities and never had a problem with the tours I booked, so it's being a very positive experience to me | Great App, very easy to use to find what you are looking for. | Great app | Great app for remote destinations | Very handy having the ability to book now and pay later | Great way to see whats on offer for your trip and to prebook some activites | Very happy using this program | All find great experience on here | The application isn't functional and no support is provided | I LOVE GetYourGuide! Wherever I go, I always find amazing experiences. The ratings I see from other tourists guarantee that I will have a wonderful time. I just got back from a two hour walking tour in Zurich, and the guide was so knowledgeable and made great recommendations for restaurants and places to go for drinks. Thank you, GetYourGuide, for the amazing events you guys have. | Very easy to navigate | Great app! Lots of activities! Offline mode is very convenient! | Good app. | Great, reliable and safe. | The Best! | We Are the pirate tour in Sharm El Sheikh ,South Sinai Egypt. 22year Experience in Excursions & travelling Around Egypt. Certificate office in old Market .we Do the best With Excellent Service ...The pirate tour.Sharm | Worse experience ever, they robbed me. Made me paid for a tour and it was free | Brilliant | So Easy to pre book admission tickets | Really easy to use. Find great activities whilst on holiday and it lets me pay in £ GBP 👌🏿 | This is so easy to use. Brilliant | Incredible confusing tour in Istanbul and extremely poor service | Low prices, very imformative | Can't recommend this app, based on the local tour companies they work with. At the end of the day, if the local tour company you buy through this app is a shambles, then that reflects on you guys. | Easy to use excellent | High khh | Makes it really easy to browse and book tours when travelling. | So easy to plan vacation activities. Great app. | Fast and easy to book | Great | Excellent app for tourism and travel expetiences | We had booked 2 tours from GetYourGuide in Vietnam. We took one of the tours but had to cancel the other. The tour was very informative and extremely well organized. The app is also intuitive and has a wider selection of tours than other similar apps. The customer support was also prompt and helpful, unlike apps like Viator. Even the cancellation process for the tour we didn't take was very smooth. Overall, I recommend this app for the quality & range of the tours & customer support | Amazing | Great options, easy to deal with | Easy to use, very quick, comprehensive info and cheaper. Can't go wrong then. | Love it | Easy to use and good prices | Good app, no app is perfect but this one has been the best for me | Great so far | The app is easy to use. Lots of options. | Beautiful | So easy to book adventure. | Good app design, good chat support, good merchants too ! | Lots of useful info in one place | Exciting way of learning different cultures | Convenient and reliable app | Have used it all over the world. Never a glitch and it's always been professional | Great service | Our Rome trip, we had plans to visit the Colosseum. Unfortunately, our flight was cancelled till the next day and they would not refund or make the visit for another day. This was a $535.00 loss.. We notified them just shy of 24hrs. They flat out refused, no attempt at all to help us. | Great app, very convenient to every traveller | Great spectrum of options, guides have been awesome. | The app is terrible. Tried to book an audio tour. Got an error message that the spots couldn't be held, go back to cart. Went back to cart, nothing there. Tried to reach via the support chat. It's a bot, and did not understand my msg. I tried calling the support line, but got disconnected. I sent an email, but that indicates that there may be a long turnaround. Also tried to attach a small image (204kb) of the error msg, but kept resetting the email page. | All I one place. Seems good so far | Too convenient. | Great app, all activities in one place | Good so far | Easy to use, great offers. | BEWARE! Tour operators are allowed to overbook tours and can cancel your booking minutes before the tour! Our tour of the Alcazar of Seville was canceled minutes before the tour due to Overbooking as we were walking to the meeting point. Unacceptable business practice! This monument books weeks in advance. We had no alternative to find other tickets in the few days we were in Seville over Easter weekend. | Very easy to view and book tours, must have | Most cheapest ticket !!! | Awesome deals | Excellent","{""1"":9894,""2"":730,""3"":1217,""4"":5987,""5"":92275}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","GetYourGuide","GetYourGuide","apps@getyourguide.com","http://www.getyourguide.com","GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH

There are few minor glitches, the map adds air travel routes when none were taken, easily removed. Highly recommend if you are travelling. | The first time I am following someone, I like it. I'm going to use it on my next trip too. | Great app, a good way of keeping track of our journeys! | Love the app | The one thing that would make this app better is being able to tag other users in steps. It would add a whole new dimension and be a nice way to keep track of people you meet during your travels. | Start using your app, following some friend's travel almost on-time experience! The only problem I'm facing is that most of my followers are French & Spanish...and there is NO choice to have posts translated automatically! This option would save me time translating & sending my travel spots by other means... Another hic...replying direct to a comment is not personalized and looks confusing on the follow-up threads. Well overall good...need some ergonomic updates, so eagerly waiting for it... | Fantastic app to track your travels. Easy to use platform. | Absolutely cool app for travel and staying connected. | We have been an early adopter and really like it for tracking all if our travels. A must have app! | Great App, with accurate location it's only downfall is lack of animation (like Travelboast) once trip is complete | I have logged many trips over several years. Those photo journals are most precious possessions. Easy to use. And the printed books are worth it. | Very great app! Only thing that could improve is connecting 2 phones to 1 account and save drafts online so the other device can edit/add photos without posting them first. | Fanastic way to save memories in a chronological order | Great ap, especially the map | An excellent way of following friends and family on their adventures! | A great little app to record & share your travels. | Fabulous way to flow my friends trip. Now I am keen to use it myself. Easy to follow. | Excellent app, useful to keep family up to date and keep a record of your travels to fondly look back on later | Loving the way I can share my travels with friends and family | Great record of trips with photos and stories that is shareable. | Lovely way to record a journey. Nice features and easy to use, love that you can see on a map where you went. Will use again! | Easy to use . | Great travel app covering all your journey. | S'il y a bien une application à avoir pendant un voyage, c'est celle ci ! 🫶 Nous voyageons partout dans le monde et cette application nous motive à écrire et photographier quotidiennement ! En revanche, les suggestions de voyage ne sont pas suffisamment mises à jour, beaucoup de voyages ne sont plus d'actualité et datent d'il y a plusieurs années... Vous pouvez suivre notre tour du monde en stop ici : MarineSamuelTravel | Excellent 👍 | Great app to keep family and friends posted and also allows you to print your album | excellent app, love it for its functionality and easy use | It has been great at helping me keep connected to my daughter while she is travelling | Pretty good needed a bit more help learning to navigate the app | Enjoyable and for my level of requirement its just brilliant | Love it, easy to use. | Great app, good to see where you've been. | Great travel app. | Great app not only for the journey you are on, but also for recording your holiday retrospectively. | Great to follow friends' holiday | Great to | I like that it has privacy settings and is relatively easy to use. However, it is not always clear for those receiving the trip updates how to access it. | I'm watching my god daughter travelling and loving the updates | But does it have a wiggle effect so I can find ez | Simple, hugely useful and aesthetic | Beautiful app. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. prefer an option to convert a future planned trip to a past trip. It doesn't let you do that manually and only does it on its own when the travel tracker is switched on. If the phone battery ends, nothing can be done. The travel tracker creates its own steps instead of converting my planned steps. Also the past trip doesn't let you add number of nights stayed at a place. It doesnt let you select mode of travel - plane | Brilliant. | Polarsteps let's us record our trips across Europe whilst also allowing friends and families to follow what we are doing. We and our friends and families do love it | Brilliant app | It's a nice way to share travel experiences with friends and family. | Love this app. My family back home had peace of mind while I was travelling and could see everything I was doing! So easy to use as well! | We use since a few months and are very pleased by it. Our friends love to follow our adventures, when they have time and want to. | Great to share experience with family and friends | I love this app... I use it often. | Very nice | Great way to keep up to date with my boyfriend on his 6 month sabbatical. Some super cool, lovely interface features! Excited to start my blog properly soon too! | Daughter uses polar steps and so do I its a good app to see where people are | Great app, really easy to use and its such a nice way to track my travel | Pleasant experience | Fabulous app for recording holidays, sharing with friends and family | A great app to keep a record and pictures of the trips we do. It's easy to use and can be shared with friends as you travel. | Fabulous to track travels and keep photo record and memories of places you have been | Love the app. Works great. Good way to record our trips and share with family. | Great app, very impressed with it | It would be nice if every attached picture might have an own description. It would be also nice if the whole route might be exported into gpx format. And it would be nice if Polarsteps map finds small villages or places too. At the moment it doesn't. | First time of using - Fabulous | Easy to use, fun, works well | Good quality | A 'new' user of Polarsteps. Been great to use...navigate around. | Very good so far | Easy to use. Great way to keep pictorial and journal records of trips | I feel like I'm on the journey too. | Useful for keeping a record of a trip. Helps others to share your adventure. | Great way to follow the adventures of our son | Very difficult to delete, set dates, can't delete steps and try again, stuck in a loop of ""trip overlaps another' that I cant delete. Really user unfriendly, a help page would be great. | Een super app om reisverhalen op te schrijven. Het is een fijne manier om alle vrienden en familieleden op de hoogte te houden. Helaas is het nog niet mogelijk om met twee accounts een gedeelde reis te maken, dat zou een fijne toevoeging zijn. | Génial pour partager ses photos de voyage en temps ( presque) réel ! | Absolutely Fabulous! | Love this app! | Great app, highly recommend | Good tracking app | I am not tech smart, and it was easy enough for me. It guided me on each step of set-up, and let me journal the highlights easily. | Excellent way to track your journey 👌 | Great app, easy to use keeping family and friends updated on your whereabouts. | Used this app to record our 2 year trip across Canada. Great to save memories of where we had been and what we had seen. Also great to share it with friends and family so they could see our adventures. It's a bit spotty when you loose signal and have to put pins in manually but 9 times out of 10 it does a perfect job. | Amazing experience. To be able to track the movements of our travellers was a real gift. | Polarsteps make it very easy to keep track of your trip and is really easy to use. I'm not particularly tech-savvy but figured everything out with no problems. I haven't made a travel book yet, but still value having the trips to look back on in Polarsteps. I also enjoy following my friends and family on their trips, fun to see where they are, and also great to see places for your own future trips. | My favorite travel-app. Tracking works well and reliable, i even could show a hiking route in a remote area. | Brilliant app - tracking, photos and comments. Just what I needed for my cycle journey along the Silk Road. | Good app 👍 | Great app, I used it to track my stops from my Asia trip | Easy to navigate good ti see the maps etc fir more perspective | Great way to document our trips away and share with family and friends. | Love being able to follow our Dutch friends as they travel across America. | Took me a little while to get used to it, but I am enjoying it more and more. My family and friends back home are enjoying it as well. | Fabulous App. It makes recording your journey and letting family and friends know where you are so easy. | Une superbe application pour garder les meilleurs souvenirs de nos voyages point par point 👌 | I really love the simplicity of use and richness of information. Love that there is a map tracker and you can always adjust according to what you want. It's intuitive, practical, clean, interactive. Top! | I found the app excellent, although it took me a day or two to fully get to grips with the way it operates - I guess I was being nervy that I might lose my input. After that it was plain sailing and it all worked perfectly. Feedback from friends and family about daily updates was also very positive. I fully recommend this (and the book we bought) and will certainly use it again future trips. | Love this tracker app really easy to use | great app! Wonderful way to track your vacation fun in one place and not being forced to post it to social media | Love this for tracking our journeys | Very convenient way of documenting your holiday instead of using a travel diary to remember what you did on what day etc. | App loads forever (when internet connection is stable) | Good app | 2nd trip using the app. Very useful for me to keep track of where we are going and where we have been | Great app. Have used it for several trips! | I love to follow my friends and familie travels. | Started a trip across Europe a few weeks ago and the app has enabled family and freinds back home to follow our adventures... and we love the track it makes across the globe. SO easy to use, edit, upload pics and videos.... just BRILLIANT!! | Great tool | i'm already on high accuracy mode but it still gives me long straight lines.. | Great for travelling | Brilliant app! Sharing and tracking works perfectly, and much safer to be able to share with specific family and friends knowing its not visible to the world. Looking forward to seeing how the auto-phkto album works out too. Great app, highly recommended. | Edit: Can you allow travelers to write a description under a picture one by one, someone uploaded a picture from a great restaurant or a great place but i wouldn't know it's details 💔 nevertheless ,i never ever thought i would like travel trackers apps, but this!!!! omg, i am in love now🥹 | Great app to track details of trips | Great App to diarise your travels and add photos to share with family and friends. They produce an album for you at the end of the trip or it's so much easier to produce one yourself. My family use it every trip. | I haven't posted anything but the posts come through well for those I follow. My only criticism would be that the notification is a bit hit and miss! Sometimes I get a notification and other times I don't.... | Love the app as it enables me to relive my voyage one day at a time. | Great | 👍🏼 | Fantastic App. Highly recommend | Love it - easy to use, and helps create a cool story | Love this app😍 | A great way to record your trip.. | Love it! Great usability, simple navigation. | My son is traveling. It's great app for us to see what he is doing. | Easy to use and a great to record your travels. | I love the app and it works great generally. I am documenting a year long journey and i can recommend it! Ome issue ive started to have recently is that it wont log me in and gives me an error. Sometimes its a few days like that before it works again. What causes this? It makes it hard to document my steps at the moment. | Love using this app to see other people's journeys and to diarise ours. Easy to use. | I have loved writing my steps down in this app , can't wait to get my thialand trip printed up in a book too , my only trouble is half my family and friends won't download the app to follow me , but hay ho who cares x | Great application, have been using it and I love it. They should add a feature for when you travel in group, we all want the journey on our profile and we have to duplicate the work. Hope to see that soon, I'll give 5 stars. | The app is great and easy to use. However, pictures and videos load very slowly (especially videos). Videos load slowly for us users and to our shared recipients. Please improve your video load time. | Absolutely fantastic app. I downloaded this app for our 7 and half month Europe campervan adventure. Its tracking our every move and displaying it on a map, exactly what we wanted. You can mark places you've stopped/visited etc and then publish it, which means it's saved. You can also add photos if you wish. Thank you for a fantastic app. | Very cool app, exactly what I was looking for! The only thing it's missing is the ability to have a collaborative trip, where you can add other people to it, and you can all add pictures and notes to the trip! Like a shared album. - that would be next level! | I have already printed four albums from my trips and I am about to order the fifth one. It's really easy to use and it's the perfect way to remember your trips. | Great app to keep a little travelblog for your loved ones back home. It tracks where you've been on the minute. You can add steps every so many minutes, great when you want to add a little sidenote in-between. The post and comment sections work just like any social media platform. Edit: One thing I would have actually liked to see added is the ability to like comments. (i.e. having a (select) option of emoji's to react to comments directly, instead of having to add a comment yourself) | I would give it a 10 stars if I could. Such a good idea, to collect all your travel memories in obe spot | Extreem mooi en handig gemaakte app! Zeer content mee :) | Still learning, but so far, I'm enjoying using this app. | Keeps my wife and I connected to our precious kids as they have fun in Europe. we live vicariously through them in NZ | Been using this for my RTW trip and it's great, a little travel diary, and also so close friends and family can see how the trip is going. | Made keeping track of our trip really easy | Used Polar steps on a previous vacation to Thailand and Vietnam it is an amazing app to chronicle all your travels and offer a book to commemorate all of your adventures in. Love this app | Love seeing the adventures of friends and family so quickly, easily and geographically | Great app to store photos show family where you've been and to track your travels, excellent | Love watching family and friends travel. | So easy and fun to track your travels and keep family in the loop | Amazing.. wish I had discovered it ages ago | Watching my sisters trip in easy and fun way. Would be better if the comments could be on specific pic and not the whole batch of pics. | Super handy app. You can even make photo books from all your travels afterwards. | Ottimo | Perfect fect for logging your route with pics. Would be Great if it was accessible for people to access it with social media that didn't have the app. But quite brilliant all the same... | We've been using it for 6 years. Reliable and easy way to track travel, add photos, and produce good quality photobooks, full of great memories. I particularly like the added automatically generated details, like the map of all travel during the trip at the start of a book and the temperature and location details for each step. Plus, it is easy to share with family while travelling so they can privately keep up to date on each trip. We've never looked back. | Just Excellent | really good to let your folks follow a trip","{""1"":2480,""2"":2067,""3"":2067,""4"":7855,""5"":71357}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","Polarsteps","Polarsteps","support@polarsteps.com","https://www.polarsteps.com",,"https://www.polarsteps.com/privacy","Polarsteps","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OoGygeN5QPb0boLM9ljuPrmYNqWK4FidNKiRVEvnevJbBd5tUvpCslQnnPkJyvEfnLSa","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kVO82NAqtE54gagBirYZ1IgXDgN_Ax7uNMjRhQTTCtn2GGo2-rB3VgxFBu6iI7X-IVMX","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IofTUFztBVIqxgZYkkOwqfLLoewF6TJXCoUVOEmUkaEU4x9e0H8k2KvyO5XOIGtomw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Pj89FzQ9nI5tAUkCvYvz-jCjBBpARyj_iYhQfVk4b5nJkxDLWTEiSUXBaJsdJ6BZbKC5"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WS_tGHckn8tOcSYjvbb66GK3fl5bUeE--MOLSd3O9El9LBfJ8Dz1COImSiMhkyv7cA"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5ivaZHITQW1Z0ih870grcZS4DM1OQJ0yFLI0vmHq6d0wXQE2lkSt3cvhyL-xGFZtwO2-"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sRwn5zcHEQooHFDGo5Ve34HsLVY1nnkWLLuZiuGDlwdlc7PQrR6I__V968veO27JQLV"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ejx00g0PlCm_sz1LMrqx_6wY7jCRCsi0XxFPuBuQ_Lioq_aOGxIfgNFBAZAs5O8DIZg""]",,,,"Teen",,false,"Sep 28, 2016",1712678795000,"7.2.1","Start planning your next trip!

Useless app | great | Top place not showing, Cannot add more than city ☠️☠️☠️☠️👩‍❤️‍👩🤮🤮🤮🤮 Wasted money | Imagine sending you for Indian meals every day when you're on a trip to Japan. Fix your bugs. | Family option only shows children under 8. what the hell is this. | I tried to use it on a recent visit to Krakow, but it was just to dependant on the assumption that we had a car, with journeys and hour and half pit of the city and missing many local attractions or locations. | Purchased the pro plan. Now I'm receiving an error every time I open the app. | 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀👻👻 | cheapest app not for any use 😟 | Purchase pro to share plans with my family and it gives an error code and will not share. I deleted all and reinstalled three app, same problem. | Only works with google account, no outlook mail no other. Too bad! | Adult only trip and no interest in museums but app recommended children's museum along with many other museums, not sure why it even has you input your interests. | I'm trying to create a route for hitchhiking from one city to another across India and make a map of my suggested route with suggested sights/activities along the way. there no way to do that, it only lets you explore an individual city within a set time frame. | I can't change the suggested restaurants from an itinerary 😔. | Although the AI part is great, I couldn't create my own travel plan | stupid app | Why go to Japan only to eat in Indian restaurants | That price for one month not worth at all. | Good idea but not for me. | Indian cities not added yet | Needs a lot of work to be useful | Politically Manipulated | Quite off target, only one 1 of 4 days planned. | There is no option for resterant | It makes you drive all over the place. Attractions that are right next to each other are planned on separate days. Bad planner. | Never finishes itinerary | Very poor app. Waste of money | I could have Googled and got better response. | Its not free ,, its not one payment ,, monthly payment almost 4$ | How can you ask fro payment without trying the service?? | Has potential, wasted $6 (not free anymore?). Itinerary keeps driving me around 2 cities that are 1 hour apart: locations 1-3-5 in one and 2-4-6-7 in the other! What a joke! Removal of the attraction doesn't work. Says, it's removed, but it's still there... Suggests to visit places for 2 hours, even though on details it shows the place closes in 25 minutes after arrival. Very poor AI. There are much better apps that are free and more logical. | Didn't help at all, | No food selection choices. Remove activity does not work at all. Useless recommendations that a simple Google search of 'best places to visit' would beat. | Maximum 10 days. Loads of questions before a trip is shown. Requires sign up. Uninstall. | the plan i'm being given is very simple and very minimal, it's taking too much time | Warthless ... poor program .. | Poor app, provides same places, doesn't save the previous configs and selected options, provides activities within activities didn't select. I'm not damn interested about mesumes. | The software now only by pay | doesn't work | good | very useful | The locations and attractions area need to be up to date. | It is very limited and not helpful | Nice app | The app should let the user change the found places or suggest based on feedbacks and other internet resources. It is like the plan is fixed and that's a bit sad! | brilliant app | Not able to generate any result. Time Waste | good | Very limited. I tried to look for information for Honolulu, Hawaii, and no results. | easy to make plans. | I need they tell me where are market clothes, museums, swap market | nice | The two cities I planned to visit are not yet added to the ai list. Useless for me this time. Uninstalling. | No cities or areas available that I would visit | Worst app I ever seen in ages | cool 😎 | no gusto.. no estan algunas coudades. sevilla no esta. | Wow | Place is not available like ujjain India.. | The application only downloads without showing any results | superb | Good idea not all countries added some countries keep loading and it on 100 % no give u any plan sorry I would love this app if it's world wide | few cities | can't plan a road trip with this | not All countries are available | App not ready for a whole bunch of places. It gets stuck at 100% all the time without generating an itinerary.. So far not useful..maybe in a year will be more ready | Frozen doesn't work | I have a Samsung galaxy 23 and when I'm trying to sign up on Google the screen it's frozen and doesn't slide down. Please fix it so I can register. | nice | Bekar apk | The app don't allow me to click on the account i want to chose to log in:( that was weird!! But it works very fine on my tablet:) | Not working | Very limited number of cities ,too many restaurants suggestions more like advertisers . Maybe will improve later on because it looks like a new app but right now not to impressive. | despite eliminating historical sights the app added them! | Necesita información sobre logística de transporte. Y poner los monumentos más importantes de cada ciudad. Las sugerencias de restaurante tienen que ser cerca de donde estas de turista en ese momento, no al otro lado de la ciudad solo para ir a comer caro y ni siquiera comida local. Si tiene varios días en una ciudad como Londres, necesita segmentar por áreas. | alot of bugs and no results if you select 12 day, also i selected luxury but still add for me cafeterias and cheap restaurants and only parks. | Worst app, it do not show nice and famous places | Has so little amount of places... | They have really less citys, most of the world don't exist | Excellent application, take advantage 👏 | Faltu, not updated | super | India places not added | Only showed 1 plan, I tired for other other country then the app gets stuck at 100% | Limited Cities you can plan with this, developer should know there are plenty of other options out there | Never loaded | Busqué 7 ciudades dentro de la plataforma, y resulta que ninguna apareció, mencionandome que esa ciudad no estaba en la lista y que pronto me notificaría cuando estuviera lista. Es súper decepcionante que lancen este tipo de aplicaciones sin tener una lista más amplia acerca de los lugares de interés. | Doesn't work unfortunately. Just shows the screen of uploading plan up to 100% and that's it. | goa is not there | best 💯 | hi iplan, first of all I would say I am in love with your app. it's just a beauty 💟. and my request is kindly post a video about your app on YouTube (how to use)..to all who don't know about your app. | Great app - hangs on 100% ! Go travel yourself! :D | goodness | only 6 cities. not a good app | App is not showing results after it has asked my preference. | loved it | I would like to find more countries like Egypt 🇪🇬 | Not showing Locations from India... | goa | Very less cities included. Not worth | Nice full proof planning | Still ai is stupid , this app is not perfect, this app is also needs improvement.... Uninstalling | Doesn't have the cities I'm interested in. | Not valuable | The plan doesn't follow the instructions | Great app help full | Excellent App | Plz add food option like non veg, veg and pure veg. | it should include Airways fare from nearest airports too | Not telling how much it will cost? And It is also not showing how much the rent will be for staying there. | good work | good | Not a great app yet. There is a lot to improve if we consider iconic places and things to do. Considering AI software available the improvements should be within a day and not waiting for people to use it. | Cool concept, but repeats things a lot if your trip is longer than 2-3 days.. Not much room for modifying restaurant choices or places. You can try removing something, but it might just add it on a different day. At the moment this app is pretty limited with it's suggestions. | Not ready at all. Dont depend on it | Limited to only few cities!! | way too slow. it doesn't respon!!!! | Not enough destinations. | Gujrat is not in Pakistan, please correct that on immediately basis. | Request failed error 500 problem | Kewal mumbai diya hai aur kahi kuch dekhney aur ghoomne ki jageh hi nhai hai kya | This shows out of country.

I hope u include all cities from INDIA 🇮🇳 | Terrible | poor location which in not femous or nothing to see on that places.. | Indian City's are not added... | Very limited cities to choose from. Otherwise its a good app. | Disappointing- tried to look at my home city to see how good it is and kept stalling | Poor and repetitive suggestions | not mutch | so happy 😁😁😁😁😁😁 | Useless application There is no information of Maharashtra or Kerala or Many other destinations.. totally west of time | Places are not added yet.

Thank you Kayak for reviewing your position in relation to the map of Morocco | great tools | Good app | Overall good experience. But when you rent car, dont take the full coverage insurance option in the app. Instead buy directly from the rental company when you go to pickup the car.

When selecting date for booking, calendar appears but problem is, calendar is for next month. In order to select current month, we need scroll up. This make issue for when users.

When one of those vendors is as sleazy and fraudulent as my recent experience (Priceless car rental via Economy Bookings), the site should provide an opportunity for feedback. They don't, at least as far as I could tell. Bad on them - the car rental agencies, but also Kayak. | Excellent! | Great price | excelente | great option for comparing prices. | Very reliable. Always my option for flights. | kayak had always been helpful to researching any kind of travel plans. | Really like Kayak. | Best price | The Kayak app is great. The Kayak ad on TV with the screaming lady as a scarcrow is horrible. | we expect to see better prices ! | excellent 💯 | Fine overall, but you can't choose one specific airport - - it adds other airports (up to 70km away). | Please rollback to previous version both the app and the web page. It keeps opening the ""explore"" page and loses any flight information. Lost all the good functionalities of kayak | Doesn't seem to be able to finish loading anymore. It can't find airports if you list a city, hell today it couldn't even recognize an airport code! What broke in the latest update??

Great job Kayak, love ya! 💜💕💜💕 | nags for reviews and sign-up of accounts for no good reason | 至少在日期日历上把每一天的具体最便宜价格显示出来啊，而不是仅仅用颜色表示 | I always use Kayak! | Love it! Only all I use for travel plans. | awful place | Easy to plan ahead and find the best time to fly and best time to buy. I like that you can also rent cars and hotel rooms in the same app. | App closes when I hit the search button. Doesn't work at all | Great app. | Once my favourite app to book flights, the recent updates which make pop up the explore screen make it useless. Cant find the flights i was searching for anymore. Lucky that there is other apps. | I have used this app for years, never an issue until now. I went back to amend my review because customer service is almost non existent.

No help from the non existent customer service, i am using hopper more and more thanks to kayak | it's a very good application. | great app saves you lots of money | Good deals | good but I thought could do better with finding cheaper flights | Favourite travel app... Super grateful. Can't say how many times I run to kayak. | عالي | So far very helpful | One stop shop. | Incredably helpful!!! ...always has been. | Keeps starting as based in UK. What so good about the Brits?? Then when i input sgp, it returns as flying off from jb....

I was able to find a good cheap flight pretty easily and the price notification is also a handy feature. The ""scientific algorithm to buy tickets at a cheaper price"" isn't always correct so just feel out for it and analyze yourself as it does give you a chart and a chart of probability. All in all I like more than Experian so this app is quite nice for finding good priced flights! | Kayak, my go to powerhouse flight search engine. Incredibly comprehensive and useful. Highly recommend | Don't trust this app. | Found great price for trip to Italy | I find better deals on the actual web sites | Great app with cheap prices!!! | nice 😍 | excellent 👌 | i love it | Best deals! | Prices are not as advertised!! I get results with cheap flights, but as soon as you click on the link to get redirected, prices jump at least a few hundred percent. Went from 149 with United to 780 once on the site. What is the point in using this app? Also won't save my CAD preference, keeps reverting to USD which is an unpleasant surprise | We aren't able to filter out specific airplane models when searching for a flight? I'd rather not risk my life flying on a Boeing. | Worst travel app ever for booking hotels , every time you click a hotel the price changes by an insane amount or half the time it says the rooms no longer available... like how stupid is this app. I won't be using any company associated with booking holdings Inc because of their bad practices . | love this site! we travel a lot and always use this site! | the app gets stuck on tap the heart for just browsing. I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry. I generally check multiple sites including the individual airlines and I never find a cheaper fare than Kayak. | The Best | I would say it's the best well put app made. | V good | Constantly showing false prices. Click on flight and nothing shows. Uninstalled. | love the many options and especially how kayak manages my trips! | convenient and reasonable | good 👍 👍👍👍 | good | They should call it Kayad, as all it is is ads now. And it's not one and done. They don't cover Southwest.

But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selección). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change. I will absolutely never book through kayak again. | My go to travel app | Just updated to newer version... now useless. Can't do searches at all.. | If the app worked maybe I could give a more positive review | good service to have | great comparison site | Minghella Me..myomyomon | I cannot even get this to download. | Uninstalled .. After so many years of loyalty. I had to uninstall with heavy heart. Kayak used to be user oriented search engine and now its another corporate machine which works only for the best deals which suit their sponsors ! Bye Kayak | Won't accept payments. I tried several different cards. | Pire application. Affiche des prix qui ne sont même pas bons. On clique dessus on fait toute la manipulation pour réserver et au dernier moment ça t'annonce que le prix a augmenté. Tu retournes sur l'application c'est toujours l'ancien prix. Mettez vous d'accord | Some filters simply don't work correctly which is very annoying. Similar apps momondo do work as they should | I've used this app for years and recommend it to everyone that tells me they are looking to travel! | was such a great app but it appears ryanair is no long on it so lost all interest in the flight section | Good app | Doesn't recognise my city as somewhere to search for flights from | whenever I click on search flights...it says pls change the date or location nd search again....every single time | Nice","{""1"":5214,""2"":1507,""3"":7365,""4"":28410,""5"":268293}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"6.0","6.0","VARY","KAYAK.com","5306964836620635204","android@kayak.com","https://www.kayak.com",,"https://www.kayak.com/privacy","5306964836620635204","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/os2nMGSSawnCl1UOcgmggZ_Vbbv4-xzw--kaYW6iFs6gj8AEAdsgIrZS8do4ibTQVpY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/b1WXRJDiTjiolHwkeSSXhqMOMb2V81RK2URllM0Hkk4FNUl06oqvTIX5xmSQ8RfbqYA","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A8D7JN3ciQ1yZXeb7KyOl2UKBcx06b1a4_ErtP7gCRmggv4XgwW9dNqdXHVh5QL7kLEj"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3GRkzes4SqxMj5t68FmhsflL3Ri3IkekGMN9vMGXz3vOW2Yv1Ka7E1ZDnGwPQGnLMw"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lyEDKbQgaT4iewMW3ER9GdkDOpwJdneAkxJVzB1o3p7UWjoZGzTQ5pi4pz3MGcAAjLk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g8lY7pdqKDHxdIdEkiFrU9AQ1mbtJNrS7aKxGggCn7ZH9ElMgNVqTJrIaKILwVztMJY"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I2R4nm57Hxk1r3wt-dr1Kxye29cKin39-djIcx_mXZUj0sN92Q5zJmAHqfjO9a-Kh4gk"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ay277dGHN8FuDf3eu2zmNJGdZ_HDLjvkA-tYjfbF3hMeSyg0wJJ51JJS9I-n_sqyDvI"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bCTkjwcreBVPwt67taACVDPLAHpH-Gz_YR8guLlEUEf5fTIsVXEGdGLd-WaYfoXh5BKe"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E9432i8IXvInR6fqDwICgm6s70umKo61N2GERkSmhpEU3oTplB-ATmdI6RVNlASCNPQ""]",,,,"Everyone",,true,,1713790065000,"203.2","Few things in life are guaranteed: death, taxes… and now, getting a great deal on your flight.

Disappointing! | amazing app! | App has some great features, however it is constantly lagging and crashing. Photos are uploading for 2-3 minutes. When opening the app after crashing white screen shows, I need to force stop the app so I can be able to open it normally. Also, it adds wrong photos to wrong places although i select the right one, and then it won't let me delete the photo associated with the wrong place no matter how many times I try.

Amazing getting travel inspiration crowdsourced! | So i really like the product... however, i cannot access my previous trips or planned trips without internet... that makes it useless for me on actual trip :/ please built in possibility to access my stuff offline. | It's nice to have an app where I can search for travel inspiration, plan my trips and share my memories, all in one place. In the beginning I found a bit confusing to navigate as it handles a lot of information, but then I got used to it. And it's good to see itineraries from all over the world. | Complicated and very long to use | Great idea - isn't saving my trip plans. Lots of wasted time. | Amazing app to help you get inspired, and to plan your trip. Highly recommended! | Super easy to use and store pics from my vacation. Can't wait to use on my trip next month. | Na první release appka vypadá skvěle. Lehce se ovládá a uživatel snadno najde inspirace pro své cesty. Přidávání cesty je intuitivní a jednoduché a skvěle poskládá cestu pouze z fotek. Plánování vypadá též dobře, itinerář cesty pěkně v kapse.

If planning a summer trip during winter months. Winter closers will led to poor decision making because winter closers are used during summer planning. Also needs a daily distance calculation on the map to figure how far you can go on a day run. Have to use Google maps to check runs and figure distances. Won't renew because it can't be trusted. | Plenty of benefits to use on this app, highly recommend the premium version. | I installed, then checked restaurants around my local area only to find the list to be way outdated with many on the list closed down years ago. I can't rely on an app that doesn't keep its info up to date and relevant, so I immediately uninstalled it. | Do not waste your money on the worthless app it does nothing that Google maps doesn't do except it sucks and cannot even find state parks | Greed. I paid $36 back in February 2024 and I opened up the app and discover I no longer have access to almost all my planned trips. They require I spend even more money to unlock them. So to get everything I had for like the past three years again I need to pay $60. I just use Google and PowerPoint to plan my trips. Very disappointed. | Great planning guides with accurate and safe routes for our camper | Bought the upgrade but can't even sign into the app. No pop up telling me the issue - just a blip then nothing. | Was a good app till they changed the payment system I had trips loaded they are now all of a sudden locked and now they tell me I have to pay more money to access those trips | This app has helped me easily plan car trips to see family without having to cross between numerous other applications. They've integrated so much into one that it's a breeze for me to map out a plan with overnight stays. | Love the app but asking way too much money. A pro membership is middle of the road, only gets you 5 trips, and is $50 a year. The basic option gets you nothing. Hate that apps are so greedy. Apparently being a loyal customer for years means nothing. Absolutely ridiculous. Not only are you asking for more money but you blocked my access to trips I already have planned. | Use this because I have the Campendium package. I use it for planning only, still do Google for each days run. Like being able to look up attractions along our route. | Terrible app, don't waste your money. I have the premium version and it's utterly worthless. The route optimization is completely broken, causing the route to double back hundreds of miles to certain stops, literally take you in circles when you could reach each of the destinations in a fraction of the time, and no amount of manual rearranging fixes it. I wasted hours adjusting everything and eventually gave up. I have no idea how they charge to use the app. It can't do the one thing it should. | Couldn't do anything without making an account. | I did not enjoy this at all. App demanded I sign up, so I did, I tried to look at two things and it said I needed to upgrade. Tried to delete account, followed their support doc, can't delete account. Thanks for the headache. Would not recommend to anyone with a human body or brain. | Trash app. Useless | Helpful ideas! | Doesnt work. What a waste of time | You need to pay for an expensive year long membership to plan anything with more than two stops | Used to be a 5 star app but they've moved eveything that made the app functional behind a paywall. You can no longer see your old trips and can only add 1 stop now. The paid version is also worse than it used to be. Waypoints have gone from 150 to 20 for basic or 50 for pro and you only get 3 saved trips (less than the old free version). The map used to filter well but is now clogged with unrelated adds(ex. Hotels show up when you are looking for sites or attractions) | I found the desktop experience really helpful to plan a roadtrip we took. It provided some really interesting things to see along the way. The reason for the 3 stars, however, is the desktop UI could be better. As well, the app version, at least for Android, is really not useful I've found. Despite downloading the maps, it complained about lack of internet connection and so we had to rely on Google Map downloads. | Awesome app! easy to use. Has a lot of excellent features. | Please add dump station search! | Great app. Very useful. I love the map. Easy to plan out a road trip. Not confusing to use. Good information 👍 | I haven't used it yet, however I like that it keeps track of the height of the vehicle. I'm assuming it will show diesel stations, however it would be nice to differentiate diesel #2, B20, and Renewable 99%. Our manufacturer says avoid B20 and never R99. | Used to let you do a few pins on the map now it's fewer with free. Almost non existent. I don't travel enough to pay for the app/site. | Still needs work. I don't like the inability of the map point automatically to center on the camp I select on the left panel. | So I put hours of my time in to planning a trip this spring only to have them lock my trip because they changed the tiers. They locked the one single trip I was actively working on and want me to pay even more to get access to it. I have all my reservation numbers and notes in this app. Sketchy af and they won't be getting any more of my money. Way to screw over your customers, roadtrippers! | This app sucks n it's very hard to use | I like the service but the app keeps crashing and since unusable. I guess I'll have to cancel during my free trial. Darn | Live the mapping and all of the sights that are not on everyone's radar | Wouldn't let me create an account | Crashes on road | Dated interface. There's no apparent curation of opportunities that are suggested for your roadtrip. Expensive subscription still comes with ads, no premium features, and a limit of 3 plans and 20 stops. My request for a refund or prorated cancellation was denied. | Invaluable summer of 2021 - 8 day 2500 mile trip beautifully planned and organized in advance, changed in real time with Roadtrippers. Things wewe so familiar - because I'd already been there many times - virtually. My perfect tool! 2024 update - Upgraded. WORTH IT! DO IT! App is priceless now. When you search for locations, you may need to try slightly different search before it finds it - minor inconvenience | At first, a reasonable number of trips/stops were free minus advanced features. Then that limit was trapped behind the subscription, locking you out of trips you had already made. Then that subscription costs more _and_ gets more limited, so you have to pay for the next tier just to maintain what you've had. ""Free"" accounts are not really useable now (1 destination with 1 stop). And more and more POI are out of date or just have incorrect locations. Avoid this service. | Would really like to subscribe but current version will not let me. | Can't do anything without an account. Useless. | This is my go-to before leaving for trips! | Can't get it to work | I cancelled prior to my free trial being over and yet I was still charged a ridiculous expensive fee for what this app is. I emailed customer support and was told I was now the proud owner of a year long premium subscription that I don't want and there is nothing that can be done ""per contract"". If you're looking for a travel app stick to Google maps or go to Wanderlog. A lot cheaper and not sketchy. | Total scam, Google and tripadvisor are free and do more than this does without a ripoff double digit subscription | So easy to plan routes, see what's worth visiting and check out accommodation. Excellent app for long road trips. | I will not be making my trip until late to the end of April. Should I sign out? Don't want any trouble or problems ✌️ Thank you | I don't spend much time online. So when I downloaded this app and logged in using Facebook and my Facebook was mysteriously hacked the next day.. kind of makes me think the 2 things are related. Also there was a major pay wall to using the app FYI | 👍 app for information | A promising app which is not yet ready for prime time. | Travelling made easier with all the options this app offers. | So far so good. | Would like to unsubsidized from this app but there is no way to do so and our card was just charged for another year. Stop | Useless in Europe. I am at a very busy tourist area but the app shows no shops, restorans or hotels. When I tried to find a grocery by name the app shows only list of US located stores. The app has permission to access my location but it doesn't help | Still no Android Auto support! It is to bad as that would make this a world class app. | Would not let me create log in. | Need paid subscription to do anything other than one location. Why not just use Google maps at that point which is free. | Z×foot 4knu, | I bought the $36 plan, planned a trip, and saved it for when the time comes to officially plan out the trip. NOW, it's saying I have used up my basic plan and won't allow me to review, or edit the trip I started. SCAM! | Love it! | I had a subscription a year ago. Didn't renew because of poor maps. Got a notice that Roadtrippers was updated and better. Don't know what the updates were, but it doesn't matter because of the poor maps. I will be canceling again. If you ever improve your maps, I will come back. Make a map like the old Rand McNally paper maps and I will be back. Your maps have poor contrast between the map background and roads. When I zoom out, seconbary state roads and major county roads dissappear. | I am trying to plan a 2 week road trip around California. There is an area around Big Sur on hwy 1 that is 1.9 miles between parks, both of which are on Hwy1. The app and the desk top are both diverting me and making this a 5 hour trip. It is right in the middle of my trip up the coast making it very hard to accurately plan out. May have to cancel this subscription and find a different app. Overall the app seems user friendly, but, clearly not accurate. I hope they can resolve this issue. | I do a lot of road trips, and this app is great for planning. It will arrange stops in a logical way, but it will also allow me to move them if desired. I love the feature that lets you see the stops on a map, so I can see if a stop is too far of my desired trip route. The app can also give great suggestions for whatever your favorite thing to see on your travels is. I wish it included more hiking trailheads, but I can typically get somewhat close to where I want to go. | Love the way it pops a new waypoint into where it should be along your trip & that you can put in dates. | Campendium is shutting down and we are forced to use this app? It's worthless. No links to the blm sites, no cell coverage information, no reviews at all. | We are taking the kids and my mom on a multi destination vacation out west. I had the route mapped out. Thenstarted looking for all those cheesey touristy quick roadside attraction and photo ops. I was having a very difficult time finding them and then adding them in the right order. We got the pro package. My wife and I can now look and plan things together, and the app pin points them in the right order on our trip! It's a great tool! | Terrible trip planning. Impossible to do everything I thought I signed up for. | Gps kept thinking we were on roads we were not and it just stopped routing when I change routes. | Edit: A good company trying to make the best trip app possible. Not my favorite but you can count on them to resolve problems! | Google maps works much better. This app is severely lacking. | I cannot believe that after paying 39.99 for years I suddenly went to login and was told I need to pay even more to now have access to all of my saved trips and it won't even let me choose which of the three trips I'm now limited to seeing and the ones I need now are locked! The only way to get access to them is to pay more or delete all of the other trips I have planned/put hard work into! Shame on them!! | Great app/service to help us plan road trips, getaways, and vacations. Highly recommend | Fun and Easy to use. | They killed this app. You can't even make a trip anymore without having a paid subscription. Used to be six or seven free waypoints when making a trip, now it's three. What a joke. | Great app for planning adventures | Almost impossible to cancel premium subscription. I have never used this service and they have been charging me for multiple years. App hangs when I click on manage subscription to try to cancel and nobody responds to customer service messages. Beware. | Not android friendly and difficult to cancel membership | Great for RV or car travel. | Doesn't have Thailand in it | $49 a year....don't waste your money! | Even with my subscription that allows 3 trips, I can't access a previous trip. There should also be a setting to prevent the app from changing dates or moving stops around. | I have to pay money to avoid highways on your app are you serious, I only own small displacement motorcycles going on the highway is literally impossible for me lol I hate capitalism with a fiery passion. | App is just okay the problem is when they auto renew your subscription with no notice and even if you try to cancel it on the same day they basically tell you too bad and charge you anyway, but hey, you can still use it. | I downloaded the app and that was the only thing that went right. You can't change the path unless you add a useless waypoint to point you in another direction. You can't add dates to specific waypoints. There is no summary sheet of any of the data you enter on each waypoint and on and on. I wasted 4 hours and he ave deleted the app and WILL NEVER try to use it again. Worst program I've ever encountered in all of my days since cell phones came out! | toooo expensive and I still have to use Google Maps. | Suddenly you go from having a free option, to asking for a minimum $40/mo... which is absolutely insane. | I have used Roadtrippers many times in the past with great success. Changes to the app have made it so much more difficult to use. I keep adding things to my trip on certain days and when I move things the app will shift things to the wrong day. We rent houses so I keep the house address at the end of every day since that is where we return to. The app keeps trying to group the house listings together. Once I put something on a day, it should stay there. | No no no | I had the absolute worst customer service from this company that I've ever had. She was rude, unreasonable, and sending irrelevant ""help"" to my issue by just copying and posting FAQs or giving irrelevant answers. I think I've only had five companies this bad in my lifetime and this goes down as one of the worst of those 5. | I had the TOGO RV app that gave me RV driving time as opposed to car driving time. Since TOGO was no longer available, I received a link to Roadtrippers which doesn't have this feature. It's also very difficult to navigate. | Disappointed. Just doesn't do what it advertises. Canceling free trial subscription. Worse than being a poorly designed app, the interface flaws cause me anger. | I have had a subscription for 5 years or so. We haven't used the app much, but I kept the subscription ""just in case."" This year we are planning a couple of big road trips and thought we would finally use the service we've been paying for all this time. I had started putting together itineraries and getting plans together. Last night I found that my $35 subscription gets me almost nothing and I wasn't informed that it was changing 🤬. I can't access my saved trips from my phone. | Not going to pay 50 bucks for a map. App makers have gotten greedy. 5.00 a month I'd have been All in but not paying a tank of fuel for what I can do myself with a cheap map. Free version includes 3 stops, a 2000 mile trip requires 5 or 6 fuel stops alone not even including motels and rest stops. No monthly option, no thanks! | It's good glad to have it | Amazing tool for Trip planning. I have used it for probably 20 road trips. I like to add many places to visit, and then just switch them off if we aren't in the mood. Keeps a good record of the places we have been. Premium version is well worth the expense. | Not working | I was so disappointed with the new interface. I used the free version of this app in the past and loved finding things along my route to visit while seeing some targeted ads. Most of the features I loved are gone. The current free version is SO hard to even navigate around, I'm just removing the app. I would buy guides for vacations but can't justify a subscription, especially with as bad as it is to use. Sad to see a good product ""improved"" to the point of uselessness. | Edit* deleted the app because it would no longer let me pull it up on the browser. It auto opened the app. Once deleted I could use it on browser again.* After using this for a while: I LOVE roadtripper.... but I'm not a big fan of the app. It's much easier to use on desktop. But since the accounts connect you can do research and set everything up on desktop but have the trip easy to pull up at a moments notice via the app so still worth while. If you're having trouble use it on desktop :) | Subscribed to premium program not easy program to add things to...dates, plan stops prior leaving on trip. I don't think program is worth the $$ Goggle maps is about the same and it is free. | Seemed like user friendly platform, price is way too much for what it is. | Tried it for a bit, but there are too many things behind a paywall (that are free in other apps), and the fee is over $80/year CAD for premium and over $65/year CAD for the cheaper Pro Tier. Basic tier lacks too many features to be useful for me. | Crashes whenever you try to navigate. Product is full of advertisements which is not acceptable for a paid app. Application keeps popping up messages to renew or give a gift to a friend. Product does not include a calendar which is kind of useless considering it's supposed to be a trip planner! | The format never looked as easy as it did on the website. Maybe it was because I had the mobile version and maybe the one on the computer had a better interface. But I did not use this app for more than 5 minutes. | Could be amazing but it just crashes | I like to plan my route on roadtrippers because I can make sure that the route I choose has services that I need and it links me to motels and restaurants along the way. Also it shows me fun things to go see and do as I travel that I wasn't aware of before. I've tried sharing with friends and family to show my progress but they had difficulty accessing my info. So I just update them by email or message. | Found some really cool hidden gems. It is easier to plan out on a desktop than the app though. | Love this app great tool for mapping out your next RV adventure. Makes it easy to find everything you need on the route. | Great app for trip planning and finding things to see along the way. | Poor overall satisfaction with the app. I can get better or just as good for free. I've tried to make it my primary travel app since this app came out many years ago and was one of it's initial users, however I've found that they have pulled almost all the benefits of a free version and forcing you to pay for use. I chose not to follow suit and wound advise the same for others. Find something else as this ship is sinking. | As with all apps and programs a little bit of a learning curve. One thing I really wish it had was mileage rings to help you estimate your next stop. | Thought the app was ok. Just not for me at the moment. Tried to delete the account and despite spending some time cools not find delete option. Any Company that makes deleting an account so difficult is a concern. This experience has dissuaded me from ever trying it. | Planned my tour driving from East Coast completely across Canada to Victoria & Tofino Vancouver Island, the information on the app and storage of info was priceless to the enjoyment and success of my journey in my RV. | Scammed me out of money 👍 terrible app | I have enjoyed using it. It makes planning for trips easier to find ideas on what to do. | Very weak app that continually trys to force you to upgrade | Not a very helpful app. And I tried to cancel my subscription 2 days before the free trial expired but the instructions send you in a loop, no customer service. I tried emailing support twice with no response. No number to call to cancel, and they still then tried to hit my bank account after I sent the emails. | Poor experience and useability. Why would I want to pay for premium if it the free version barely does anything? | Really good search function and filter options. Great for finding camping with facilities. | Shouldn't have to have an account or login just to get directions. The search use to be better also. Deleting from my phone. | Best app for planning a road trip | A roadtrip with only 1 stop? $48/yr to save additional stops? That's ridiculous. The app looked good until I tried to save a second place and was stopped. Also, you need to register an account for the free 1 stop version. For $50 I could just hire a travel agent for 2 hours | Lmao they want like $60 for the most basic features like adding more than 3 things to your trip. This app doesn't do anything you can't do in Google maps. | Not exactly clear when you install and then pay the annual subscription for the Android version, that this only directly integrates with Apple Carplay and not Android Auto / Google Maps (unless you walk through a manual import/export process) Useless in practice for any android user and a total waste of time (setting up your route) and money | Easy to use and provide lots of good references for places to visit and things to do. | Love this app!!! | I'm enjoying planning my cross country trip with Roadtrippers. 11.14.23 I'm adding to my review because I've had 2 more cross country trips. I love this app. It's been a great tool to explore places I'm not familiar with. | Not free. Just charge for the app to start with and quit wasting people's time making accounts. | Was great, free version was limited to 5 stops per trip, but not its 1 trip only, and all other trips I had are inaccessible. I'm guessing not enough people wanted premium. I sure won't now. | I am excited for my son to do a road trip and use RoadTrippers. I love this app. I love being able to add from my phone and the website on our computer. So looking forward to going on our 2nd cross country road trip using this app. | This program isn't very good. Hard to route, not user friendly. | Roadtrippers makes planning a trip fun but it has some serious flaws. The worst is that the coordinates for many of the places don't point to the place's actual location. Although the address is correct, the navigation takes you somewhere else-- sometimes over 50 miles from the actual location. It made it impossible to rely on the indicated route. Other flaws were less serious but still frustrating and made the trip build process much more cumbersome than it should have been. | Used it to plan my trip with the hubby to Gatlinburg TN. Had a blast will definitely use again | Paid my yearly subscription, they locked me out of trips I already went on and trips I already planned because their rates went up. Bad business. | Great experience great product | Excellent resource for planning routes | When I say this thing saved me every family vacation we've ever had, I make sure to find things we can do on the way there and on the way back. It not only provides you with the name of the place but the hours if it's open. Also gas stations along the way so you can plan your route and then you can save everything all together and share with your husband or co-pilot or friend that's going with you. It makes traveling together easy | This app makes it so easy to plan a roadtrip! I love it! | the idea is cool it's outdated and not worth the free version. | Nope. This is so poorly executed that it is like a comedy routine. I opened the app and searched for lodging near me. I found several non-active links, an automobile repair shop, a dog kennel, all listed as places to stay mixed in with legitimate lodging. I deleted the app at that point because if it is this poorly edited, I am not using it for free to attempt to plan a road trip, let alone paying for it. | All locations are pulled from yelp, so many are missing. You can only customize a trip with 3 stops before having to upgrade to premium, and 2 of them are your stopping and starting point. | A great app for starting your travel plan, probably needs more input for Aussie destinations. Sometimes finnicky when adding waypoints specially when using a tablet. Well worth the cost | Excellent and affordable app, I've been using it for years! | Didn't use the app and it ended up billing me. I've had a hard time trying to get a refund. So 1 star until this can be fixed. | Not worth the money, seemingly impossible for me to cancel the membership now. | Awful. Make it impossible to cancel. Canceled twice now and keep getting charged. | Best app I have used for road trips yet. Pland 4 cross country trips with it and still very happy. The only one yet I've used that I've been willing to pay for. I do wish it could be used on android auto. | So far, so good. I used the Good Sam trip router for a long time & was reluctant to give it up. I definitely think Roadtrippers is better!! | Sent me spam and survery solicitations that I explicitly opted out of, respect your users. Uninstalled and requesting a data deletion, clearly can't trust this company with your data. | Definitely the best road trip planning application available for Android or iPhone | Easy to understand and follow | UPDATE: After reinstalled the app works as expected. The ux could be improved for interacting with the app after the initial search. The support team is engaged and actively solving problems. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Useless app suggests stupid way off the route | Great planing app | Makes Road Trips so easy. | Did not help at all! | Can't even get logged in to plus even though I paid for it unless I click forgot password and use the click option from email to reset. | Great tool for planning a road trip! | I am still in the free trial period. We really like the app and its planning capabilities; however we really need it to be compatible with Android Auto. It was not until I had already downloaded it and charted out some test trips that I realized it does not Sync with Android Auto. I have an iPhone for work and it functioned just fine on CarPlay but my personal devices are Android. When active in CP it disrupts my ability to use my Android as hands free. Without AA, I will likely not subscribe. | Very user friendly app for planning and scheduling road trips. They also provide suggestions on attractions to visit on the way. I rely on Roadtrippers for all my long drives. | Allows quick and enjoyable trip planning | 5 stars for the concept, 3 stars for the execution. The app has a variety of bugs that make it very frustrating to use. When you go into map mode, it only shows your trip in numbers, not a named location, making it so you have to toggle between itinerary and map to route your trip in a logical fashion. Specific trip details are unable to be added in spite of a toggle that shows you can. These are just a few bugs, but there are MANY more. Fix the bugs, it would be 5 star app easily! | After several.years of using this app, I will be deleting it. Can't access my past planned trips, can't use it to plan a trip unless I am not going to stop anywhere. Pointless. | Nice app that's what I wanted to do would be nice to be with organize the locations | If you sign up for free trial there is no place to unsubscribe, they don't send email warning but just charge your accounr then refuse to refund your money. The app is worthless on top of it all. | Expected an active map update as you drive like Google maps or garmin. | Does not cover Europe | Not user friendly No close up No weather No directions Ugh | This is our fourth year using this app for our annual two-week motorhome trip and it has been invaluable to us planning the trips months ahead of time and making adjustments on the fly. As we select waypoints and campgrounds it creates our routes and organizes the waypoints in an efficient order. When we need to find campgrounds or free overnight RV parking while driving it makes the process easy. | Still have issues getting most recent notices | 2nd trip and love this app!! | Not totally impressed. Data and reviews outdated. Not comprehensive enough | Really nice app. Had two long road trips this year and this app really helped by estimating the distance and time between each stop and identifying places to stay and visit. | This is not user friendly nor is it very helpful. Even the pd version made difficult to track a trip across the country with several stops. I canceled my subscription and would not recommend it. | We are on a cross country trip and the app has been invaluable helping us to navigate our trip. | Essential for planning long days of yardsaling. Takes all the headache out of planning multi-stop trips. New features like being able to custom name stops and add budget for each stop is awesome. Will be a customer for life. Worth the money. Exactly the app I was lookng for. Makes my life easier. | The app is fine if all you plan is what road to take is safe for your RV. I however, like to plan not only the road but the gas and rest stops. This app only let's you plan the road selection. You have to use another app to plan stops. | Roadtrippers has made planning our trips super fun and easy! | Bad directions. Worthless sites listed. Will unsubscribe. | You have to pay now for this to be useful. They changed from 7 to 3 free way points. Meaning start location, one stop, and end. You cannot see your past trips they are locked unless you pay over $30 a month. I am closing this app because of this. I do not travel that much to pay that amount, and Google doesn't take away my agendas and lock them from view. | Very disappointed in this app. No help on putting in waypoints. Immediate upgrade needed before you plan your first trip. | makes road trip planning a lot simpler by having various options for the trip at your fingertips. | Very good. Traveled 5000 miles without any problems. | Useless without subscription. | Makes planning road trips so much easier... and I also love their maps and the things I find to do along the way that I didn't even know to look for! Game changer! | forced app installation when it's available on normal web is scummy. | Nice to plan trips and see what there is to see along the way. It would be nice to see a diameter around the area to help you find stops with a certain time period-ie.5hrs of driving | Crashed whenever I tried using it, never worked once. Sorry? | Attempted to try the app and it required an account. Annoying, but ok. Tried to log in with Apple and that failed. Ok. Tried to log in with Facebook and that failed to. Ok. I'm not creating yet another account just to try this out. If you're going to offer Apple / Facebook login, maybe make sure they work? | Great tool for taking long road trips. Helps to organize your ride. Lots of information for everything you need. | A must have traveling app for anyone planning a trip. We used it for a 7-week, cross-country, 50-stop trip and it worked so well. | Love sharing and working with my friends to plan a trip we all will enjoy! We can each look at interesting places and activities to do things on our bucket lists! | DONE WITH THIS APP. Long-time user but we are not using any longer. Created a new FREE trip a couple months ago and now I can't access that trip unless I pay to unlock it. We've paid in the past to add way points if we needed. Otherwise RT was free, and to now block my trip that was a free trip, already created? You've lost several customers now. Using the free 7 day trial to screenshot my trip and then we are deleting it. Horrible approach, horrible customer treatment. | I've been using this app for years now to organize my trips before going. | Fantastic App to map out a journey any place you are travelling | Not my type. | Makes vacation much easier to plan and nice to have a record of your trip! | this app is crashing all the time. unusable. | downloaded it. used it for less than 5 minutes. deleted already. wont stop crashing after trying to do a search. | Crash, Crash, Crash | Dang near impossible to cancel service. Still trying to cancel this app. Stay away. | Live road trippers. Wish I could share a trip map and details with one person at no charge, one time. They could only look at it, not make changes. | Not easy to add additional stops. Only three waypoints allowed if not paying. Planning a trip across a couple states? Not if you want this to plot your hotel, gas, and more than one restaurant. Immediately deleted. | Awful updates make you pay for features that used to be free. | Worthless now, you can't even try it out if your trip is too long. Like going from denver to Boston I apparently need a subscription now. I didn't before. This app was amazing before the new update, and I use to recommend it to a lot of people, I won't anymore. Good job killing your own app being greedy. | Google maps doesn't beg for premium to add a second stop on your trip.","{""1"":2138,""2"":521,""3"":333,""4"":948,""5"":4128}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$6.99 - $59.99 per item","10","10","VARY","Roadtrippers","Roadtrippers","support@roadtrippers.com","https://roadtrippers.com","131 E McMicken Ave

I am disappointed... | Put some effort in error handling. | Wish there was a way to add your own place you want to visit. I.e. a theatre or specific address. | Wish I knew if this before. | Scam. They say it's free and even before use it everything is blocked unless you subscribe a plan. | great trip planner app | plans created do not reflect opening/closing times. Can't visit night markets at 0900 hrs, not weekend only markets on weekdays! & some prominent new attractions like IconSiam can't be found & added to app | This is a great app with everything in the one place | Great app that gives you a lot of options for sightseeing in cities around the world. The new feature that allows you to set when the day starts for touring is a welcome capability. I've used this in multiple cities around the world. | Wow, downloaded for our upcoming trip to Oslo and the first thing on all the itineraries is the Viking Ship Museum.

The biggest attraction in the capital city closing for 3 years should have been noticed by a trip planning app. Uninstalled. | Visit A City™ | I love this town | Junk, simply a collection of subcontractor tours and associated services | For amsterdam it doesnt update the edited plan. Even after deleting the whole itenary it doesnt refresh the updated itenary. Very bad app experience. Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | ""IMPRESSIVE""... This APP covers almost everything... Great Job👍 | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of ""enshittification"" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing 😍 | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say ""coming soon"" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | tốt | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for. | This app/company will add your email address to spam lists with no authorization, so don't use any of the SSO options when you launch it! How trashy. Don't start emailing me your newsletter just because I opened your app one time. | good experience in yelanaka oon bikes the feedback related vehicle are good, the way of approch towards the costumer was brilliant , the vehicle are well maintained with proper fueling in the bike that I have took overall experience was good | Creating new plans and editing existing ones could be easier, but it offers a wonderful service | Really great app for planning a visit somewhere. So many options!!! I just wish I could connect my trip accounts (hotels, flights, etc) for points and discounts. Also, it would be nice to see AAA or military discounts. Excellent app and I'm excited for this application's future! | was this a joke | I can not use the app, appear google notifc. Of loc. And I cant use | Love the website. But the App is not working. Android 12. Just white screen when I open it. | Deeply unimpressed. I had already put together my itinerary of Amsterdam and very few of the places were listed and some were in the wrong place. | ok so far | Happy so far even the app looks like iOS. Probably Flutter tech. I will do 5 stars if I can manage to mark as visited the attractions. | Permission hogger. If I say no to the location permission, it means no. Spamming it, will not change my mind. | Nice app, very easy to create an itinerary and to find great places to visit. Needs some improvement when changing the day within an itinerary. | All the app can give you is paid places tours. Nothing like real travel plans. | For your day tours, couldn't you include (or at least have it as option) a STOP FOR LUNCH??!!....then resuming the tour in the afternoon?? | nice app to use when planning a trip. They show a diverse assortment of activities in each city. I especially like that they have trip planning by day and desired level of activity. 1, 2 or 3 days plans. | Doesn't even work on my new tablet but good on PC or phone! | Great trip planner for international travelers. | Such an amazing tool, don't leave home without it! | Excellent tool for travel | I've used in 10+ cities and it's great for planning day-to-day activities and staying organized, and also finding things to do on the fly. It's really helpful that you can add other plans, like visiting friends, theatre tickets, etc. and find things to do based on your location so they're easy to walk to. My only complaint is when creating plans from a wishlist, it prioritizes location over operating hours - what's the point of getting somewhere efficiently if it's closed when you get there? | perfect app to plan your own tour or get private tours. Very helpful. | Location permission Pop up never goes away. That's so enoying. | All my plans disappeared after opening on the web | Not impressed by this app at all. I was expecting to be able to add sites in the cities I am visiting so I could plan the best route to see everything. Unfortunately, everything in this app was geared toward booking tours. I understand that they need to make money and, if you are looking to book a bunch of tours I'm sure this is great, but this is not what I was looking for. Huge disappointment. | Nice | Formerly useful app. This app allows you to plan a multi-day itinerary in some detail. You can take one of their plans and move attractions around to suit. Just a few small improvements would help: 1) Ten day trip maximum is too short 2) Should allow a fixed time for reservations 3) Should be able to change hotels to allow a multi-city trip UPDATE 2022-08 Sorry to say app and Web now useless as some recent reviews have noted. Zero stars | very helpful app for making effective use of your time in a city | Very helpful app, but a number of glitches and needed features make it a 3 star rating. | Just an app selling overpriced tours. Better to do a little research by your self. | Great app | Great idea - shockingly poor execution It's like first draft. Changes times & days in my plan. Unable to move them back. Can't add ANYTHING that's not on their list. Forced to have events one after another, as if I'm not allowed a break. Very frustrating & unnecessary | Music tour | Great idea, really helpful but UI is not intuitive at all! It's frustrating to use as I can quite add 1 day guides per day, but then it's over writing them. Just really confusing! | it's a good app | Keeps freezing | Exceptional. I downloaded map and managed to use it in offline mode. No need to ask others how to reach places. | I was really enjoying the app, I'm going on a trip in 2 weeks and it really helped me to organise things, I paid for tickets through the app and the money has left my bank and now the app has crashed. What do I do? | the app won't open... otherwise I love the app. please fix it | not working, exactly when i need it, with locally dowloaded data, every page is an error page | Please check after new update..the app is not working...I tried reinstalling many times but no luck...could you help me with that.. | Worthless now that it only works for booking tours | top app, incredibly useful. highly recommended | design your itinerary like a pro | Nice apps | brilliant app. | I used this app all over Italy. it's great! | Great idea! | Expensive and limited activities. Sometimes there are only 6 activities even though the place has more to offer. Other apps are better. | Excellent travel tool! | Tried using the app to plan a trip to Malta. The only plans it comes up with is for Valetta.

Tells you exactly what bus to catch, when, and where basically anywhere in the world. Even better and more accurate than asking the locals. | Love the app but it will not let me login by using the app | Good apps | It quick and on point 💯 two 👍 up. | very useful | Utterly reliable | Easy to navigate, reliable, covers many regions. | my go to app | A great one stop shopping experience for figuring out where to go next and how to get there... | Options are often not reliable. Some options are not shown. Some shown are not available. | Brilliant app | Helped us during our DIY trip in Singapore! | Great idea, executed brilliantly | So helpful not only getting around abroad but also traveling around the USA. I love this app | Use it with every trip ! | Rome2Rio is my go-to app whenever I'm planning a trip anywhere in the world. I also use it for local purposes. I love that it provides information about multiple transportation options with approximate prices. SO helpful! | Excellent app. Would not want to travel without. The maps are terrific. All modes of transport are shown. Links are so helpful. | Messy. | Great app for travel in Europe | Excellent | Route information given by app doesn't give the optimum route possible. On one test, the most efficient and direct route wasn't even one of the options available. The problem is that the app may actually be trying to be too precise, rather than look at a general location in the area, that general location would have probably resulted in the optimum route, but because it was too precise, a less optimum route was shown. I don't think I would rely on this app to actually get to a destination. | Love the versatility | Very useful for trip planning.👍👍👍 | Great app for travelling. Very detailed | Together with Google Maps these are your go to guides. I have travelled now to give very diverse countries and I rely on this app heavily. Two thumbs up from me. | Must have app I would be so lost without it! | Multi-route feature removed. | MISLEADING!! Do Not rely on Rome2Rio data. Gave me lots of options for a bus trip. After going to buy tickets, none of them exist. NONE! Worse still, that bus route doesn't exist. I did the searching a couple months ago, and today Rome2Rio shows the same false availability. our plans are ruined. Not impressed. | Lovely app | Easier youbto enjoy the world trip | This app very easy and comfortable.. | Indispensable in planning a trip abroad. | The best | I tried with many places in different countries, It's very, very, very good. | Omg it help me a lot vist London as fresh. | Great details | Super | Great help for travellers! Thanks! | Very helpful - long distance or just over to the mext town. | Make reservations for transportation so easy! | Brilliant. | Best app bhai!! | Very useful for advice and ideas how to get there. | It's really helpful. Being a solo traveller It's my local guide anywhere any time... keep it up | A very helpful app when traveling! | It is excellent great help for planning trips everywhere in the world, and it's where I start | Always helpful anywhere we travel!! | Really useful. I appreciate that it doesn't hold me to a particular date and time but lets me review my options. Seems to cover everywhere I want to go. And of course the multimodal transport choices are the killer feature. | Very useful | Can't sync itinerary with computer to app. No sign in so all info you input on computer doesn't carry over | Very useful app! | Rome2rio is my go to app whenever I plan my travel I wouldn't ever travel without first consulting rome2rio | Very flexible access to travel planning options | Really helps you plan your trip. | Never been disappointed | Excellent & Fantastic app for Travellers . | Exceptional! | Wherever. We go in the world this app is 100% amazing x Thanks a million!!! | Always spot on! Used it in many different countries when traveling, and when planning Never disappoints. | it is helpful app for transportation in Europe (Crotone) | R2R was working okay but last few weeks has been unresponsive and glitch on my Samsung Android. Uninstalled, cleared cache, made sure system updates were recent, etc. Reinstalled and same issues so I am bailing on it. | I like this application, it helped me a lot to travel abroad. Thanks a lot. | Very usefull | Best app for budget travellers like me , just awesome liked it | Excellent, very stable and solid options | Good | Wonderful way to easily make an informed decision about my travel options. | Good | Great for trip planning. | C'est vraiment très précis, grâce à ses créateurs | The app is great if you want a general overview of the route, but compared to the website it doesn't give you nearly as much information. | It's accurate and lightning ⚡ fast👍 | GAWD awful on my older Motorola Android. Uninstalled! | Amazing information on otherwise hard to find connections | Exceptionally easy app to use to see all modes of transport from A to B. Very accurate times and information help you plan your journeys. | Useful | Easy to use. Great info and app! | Useful and easy to use | Very useful for travel using various modes of ground transportation | I've used this app to help plan my travels in Uruguay & Brazil. Nearly every journey has been wrong, either buses that don't exist, always incorrect durations (add an hour or two if you are planning connecting buses). I have found so many better options when I have gone to the bus terminals, with direct routes, destinations and alternative bus companies not shown on the app. The app does however, give you a good indication of routes that are available. | Detailed and accurate information, saved us so many times using public transport abroad, love this app | A great up for my self rely travel..very accurate when it comes to transportation. | Helped me travel across Portugal, Spain, Catalonia, France, Monaco, Luxembourg, Belgium & Netherlands. | Useful | Used extensively for trains, planes and other transport right through Europe from London to Naples | Easy to use, showing alternate routes | Damn good | Excellent Excellent Excellent | Effectively help for navigating new areas. | instead of giving the cheapest ways ""for example (casablanca morocco to casablanca airport) it said taxi but taxi is the most expensive choice [35 dollars], you can do by train and it's easier and cheaper [5dollars]. also the app is not giving opportunity to add or correct things . i would give less than a star if i could . 👎 | Why this app always 'hang' nowadays? Frustrating! | Exceptional | Easy to use | doesn't work well on Android. can't get out of settings. | Has helped me plan how to get aroind in almost every part of the world. Before I leave amd when I'm traveling. Great! | Buggy since migrating from Fetch My Way. It hangs after one or two searches. Not very usable. | Good app | The best trip planner ever.. | Very friendly easy and informative. | Very good app | Brilliant. I've been using it for a few years now. Always tells me various options for getting somewhere. | Excellent | Great app to help tourists with navigation | Great | Always accurate info. Well done! | A wonderful app! After getting bamboozled by disconnected train schedules and prices for a trip across Europe (and nearly giving up to hand it all over to a travel agent) I found Rome2Rio. The big advantage is it enables you to find the best connections between destinations, whether by plane, train or bus. If you are planning any kind of non-standard travel i.e.not just a city to city hopover, YOU NEED THIS APP. (I have seen the negative reviews. but have had no such problems) | Amazing app. So helpful to travel anywhere! Great! | Difficulty positioning the starting city and the destination city. | The best app for addresses, distances, transport, etc....Globally!!! | Very helpful. Definitely recommend using this app for Italy, Switzerland and Paris transit. | We have been traveling in Spain and Portugal for the past month. RomeToRio has made it easy to figure out our transportation options and to book tickets. | Very useful. | Daljit taxi service | So useful in planning trips to Europe. | Need update Not working | Super útil | My goto app to plan routes.

It's a must have for any independent traveler. | Love this app very useful... | Very good | My go to app for distances when travelling. | Don't be a weirdo. Just download it. | Best app ever, always right, always accurate, invaluable when travelling off grid. | Great app for figuring out how to get to places locally or farther afield. | Please please bring the multi-stop feature back! That used to be the most helpful feature until the redesign a few years ago. Now it's just generic and not all that useful. | Hopeless app, it doesn't work! It won't go past the initial opening page (I can't in all honesty call it a welcome page) | Excellent go to app | Excellent. Been using for over 8 yr in USA, Europe and India. Helped me every time. | Awesome and easy to use. | This is such a great app for planning your itinerary! I'm working out train and bus travel around Japan for our upcoming trip and it is so useful. With all the information on times, costs etc it will be invaluable when we are actually there | Superb. | This app used to work well now it doesn't I can't get it to work | excellent | Love this app! So helpful!! | Good apps | Nice. This is the best route finding app for travelers. So useful with so many travel options. | Guys literally.....this is the best app available for your trip planning......from routes to ticket bookings to hotels.....helps you in every way possible 😍 | This app is amazing! It gives you good directions on how to get anywhere you want to go. | The app is very accurate. I love it. | If you need to coordinate time and transportation between unrelated events , or to determine feasibility (route and time in route), or the existence of transportation in an underserved area to begin with, this is the app to use! | Hi. I dident find wery accurate this app. For exemple the app says there is a train from Timisoara to motru and that there is 5 ways to arrive there. There is no direct train from Timisoara to Motru. I know bcz i made this rute many times. It goes only till Drobeta Turnu Severin. You have to find someone there to drive you to motru or take a taxi. The best way to arrive to motru is by taking the Drobeta bus(You arrive in 6) or by car witch is the fastest option | Fantastic for planning a trip to get ideas on transport options and travel times. | So far, so awesome! | The app doesn't include small, regional bus companies (at least not in Italy) but that's not a big deal. It's easy to find that information in the small cities anyway. | I had to go to my nana's funeral in ASHVILLE,N.C. But for some reeason, I had to get off at the Atlanta, GA Airport and I used this app to get all the way to my Nana's house in 4 hrs taking greyhound from airport ,than a subway,than a bus, and finally a ride share for the last 10 miles, I know it sounds crazy bit I never had to wait more than 5 mins at any of the stops, and an event that should have caused me enough stress to need a few glasses of wine was actually not stressful. Total cost $36 | Truly love how detailed this app is. | Helpful to find transportation alternatives to any place in Europe | I love this app. I use it all the time. The information is spot on. They make travel a breeze! Thank you for that. | I am giving it 4 stars just because in rare times the information is not totally accurate... Nevertheless it is a great tool !! | Been using this App for years. Invaluable for world travellers. Very stable. No issues. | Awesome help in our recent international travels. Felt in control of transport even when we didn't speak the language | It delivers 👍 | Amazing App. Saves you in so many ways. | Better than all the rest | Nice .,. working ... | Awesome app and very helpful and easy to use 👍 | Love the speed and design | Best app ever to help travellers negotiate there travels | Helps me get around when google maps fails! A must for public transportation | Just easy to use tap in destination and off you go | Very thorough and useful. My main go to app for transport options from any point A to point B. Keep it up! | The App for intercity transport!!! Nothing else like it. Always use when planning vacations....very quick and points me in the right direction if I need further info. | Easy to use app for travelling. We've used it all over Europe and will be using it again on our mini vacation. Highly recommend keeping it on your phone. | It is a top app for travelers | In Japan only gives routes; not times nor platforms. No option to enter passes. No option to reserve seats. | Best walking guide. | Makes it a very easy way to get around cities. Has all the options you will need. | Money and life saver for travellers | Very Useful Application. | Wonderful app. Especially if you are new to a place this app would definitely help you navigate with ease. | very useful - my only complaint is that I can't find a way to do multiple trips in one search. | Great app | The BEST site on the WEB for Travellers. I use it constantly when planning my trips to Japan.

Easy to add personalized things. I have the paid version. | Excellent app, it does the job as expected. | I paid for this app but it wouldn't allow me to add items to the packing list. Every time I tried, the app crashed and closed. I was never able to make my packing list with this app and I forgot to pack a few things! I'm not happy. | Very essential | Very user-friendly | Great app for any type of checklist! | I really like it | Great idea. The app won't allow me to select just 1 clothing item... it's zero items or more than 2... I deleted the app. | Easy to use | It is nice for a basic, single city trip. However, there is no way to create a single packing list for a multiple city trip that could include one place cold and rainy and another that's warm and sunny. I wish I could type in multiple destinations with there dates and come up with a unified list. | Can't add to list, app just closes | Why does the past packing list go away?? Why not let us decide to keep it or not. Also no option to select between male / female | How to add counters for customised items to specify the count? | I wouldn't buy it again. Too buggy. If you update template it doesn't update the trip. If you update trip there is no way to update template. There is no search options. If doesn't recognize the place it just picks whatever the app want to choose. | Make packing easier | Crashed every time I added an item but still really cool if their last is perfect. It's auto generated after filling out some questions. Really cool. Never mind, I changed to 5 stars. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which resolved my issue. It works great now | Helped me think of things that I hadn't thought of. | A nice app to help you organize your packing before a trip. Love how you can customize to fit your needs. | This was a godsend as I was packing for my trip. Because of this app, nothing was forgotten that I had to go out and purchase. I also used it again for my trip back home, so I was sure I didn't forget anything there. In the end, I am confident this could potentially be labeled as a money saver! I love this app!! | Covers all necessities | This is my favorite packing app... It is perfect 10 /10. | It's a life (and luggage space) saver | Can only use for 1 location. Very disappointed | Must try | So helpful with all the travel we do. This app really helps ease my packing anxiety! | Super easy and complete! And fun to use. | It's legit. I always struggle at the last minute to remember everything but this generates a check list for you in seconds | This app is very helpful. Since I travel with my dog, I would like to have a way to remind me what to pack for him. Other than that, it's a great app. | Very Nice And Helpful for Travelers, Easy to use | I used to love this app but it's no longer reliable. Items keep disappearing off the list for not reason, then you end up forgetting things. | Easy to use... | It is very helpful when it comes to packing but some things may be annoying to other like the sound effects. Overall i belive this is a good app | The edit and delete buttons overlay the quantity button and are very glitchy | I do really like this app, but honestly I'm only doing the review as the constant 'rate the app' pop ups are really annoying me 🥲😅 | Great app | So far so good! | Good app - best packing app I've been able to find. Please make it possible to rearrange the activities once they're in your list. ie. I prefer to have ""clothes"" at the top, then ""toiletries"" then ""electronics"" but it just places them in whatever order it wants. | Lack of support after purchasing the app. I had purchased this app on a different phone. When I installed it on a new phone the purchase didn't transfer. Tried contacting support several times without success. I switched to a different app. | Goood | Helpful app, haven't forgotten anything using this. | This app is definitely not as customisable as one would hope/expect in the paid version. | Great, easy to use app | Great app. Love it had location | Very thorough list | Easy to use. Very useful! | Really handy. Use for all trips. Just purcahsed the full version and custom lists are so useful. | Useful | Useless | Even after trying many times, adding stuff doesn't work. And when I delete things or mark them done, they come back! It's really annoying and makes using the app not uaeful at all. | Good covering all items | In App upgrade doesn't work. Money wasted. | It keeps deleting things I've added to my list. Maybe it's just me being a noobie. But the idea is not to forget anything. How can I do that if it deletes it without my knowledge. | An app that makes packing easy | Very cool | Very nice app | Used to love this app but now unusable due to bugs that prevent saving changes to templates. Only half the items added appear and some are randomly deleted from the template and from the trip packing list itself. | Easy to use Great prepopulated categories. Good price if you need to customize it | I've bought it but it doesn't work. When I add a new item on the list it shuts down. I would like to be refunded please. | Very helpful! | Very helpful I have a tendency to forget get all the stuff helps a lot | I really wanted to live this, even paid for the app. However, it does not save what new items I add to the list. ☹️ | Used to like it but a bug has made it unusable I was using this app often and found it very handy but recently I cannot add additional items to the lists because ever time I do the app crashes. This had made the app unusable for me which is disappointing. | Good guide for planning your trip | Kept removing things from my list on it's own | The free version at least is not customizable at all so it's kind of useless | Keeps crashing within a minute. Also lack of multi destination makes it very inefficient. I'll be asking for a reimbursement. | Superb | Very useful | Very useful for keeping track of what to pack | It has a lot of useful items and you can add your special items! Easy to use. | Great | Good app so far. | Easy to use, very thorough. | Good, does what it should even the free version | A good reminder | Very handy. Use it before every trip. Love that I can add custom items and change the order of the items in the pre-built lists (in the free version). I do wish I could change the order of the entire category lists. If I've chosen Working, it always appears as the first list even through I'd rather Essentials and Toiletries were first. | So helpful!!!! | Zero support! They never respond. Too bad. With a few improvements to editing as others have also asked for, this could be a nice 5 star app. | Helps you remember the little things. Used to pack things weeks before and list reminds you what you put in bag already | Nice app. Very helpful. Would be better if you could print the list. | Absolutely love this app. Easy to add new items (with premium) but only add them directly to the main list of you wish them to be temporary. If you want them to be permanent you can check on our off for present and future travel, scroll to the bottom to ""customize packing templates"" and add things there you permanently want on your packing lists. So smooth. I will use this app for years. Much better than my previous one and I love that you can customize for various types of travel. Perfect. ☺ | Best app for packing | Wonderful app. It helps you not forget anything when packing! | Essential for traveling | Limited editing options without upgrade. Items you add to the preset lists often disappear. | I love pack point I just wish I could add my own activites and customize my pack template 🤔🤷‍♀️ | Ready made lists for easy packing. No more oops, I forgot to pack... | Honestly this was just a waste of time. You have to buy premium just to add more dtuff as this is just ai generated. | Now they removed the swipe action so I can't remove the unnecessary items in the list, do I have to customise my list every time before the trip? That just don't make sense | Even after purchasing the app, no edits to the default lists will save. If you remove them to recreate them with your own items, the icons are not selectable (i.e. the toothbrush). There is no way to edit trip information if you make a mistake. Nor is there a way to edit a list item without deleting it and recreating it. | This is a wonderful app that helps me not forget things I need. I use it for every trip. | 🙂 | I like it very much | 👍good👍 | Please enable changing language in app | Good 👍 | I don't understand why this app has so many high reviews. I made a list for an upcoming trip and immidiately started noticing issues such as; when it automatically added the items to my list at the starts I would delete them since I didn't need over half of them, later on I would try to add them back on but it wouldn't let me since I ""Already had them in that category"" but I had deleted them before. I aslo still haven't been able to have more than one list at a time and it's so frustrating. | Looks like a great packing list | Ver useful app and it allows you to add items to your list or swipe away items you won:t need. | Makes packing more efficient | I always use this when going on trips so I don't forget to bring anything, I check off what I pack and add to list anything else I need. I can also use it as a to do list for the day by just typing it in. | Enjoying the app so far. Great ideas for packing lists while also letting me customize to my needs. I wish I could edit the items in the list (vs deleting and adding a new item). I also wish there was an easier way to add items that may have been removed, without retyping them. But other than that, I have enjoyed the app. | Random list of things I didn't select is added to packing list when shared, but it's a semi useful reminder tool | I've always struggled with packing, and this app makes the process way simpler for me! | Great 😃👍 | Everything ok, but I would suggest to add the option of having a different language from the system one. It is not possible to choose different languages. | Good app no complaints so far. Been using since 2021. | Nice travel package APP | Cruise Packing not available. | Easy to use | If activities don't include fishing then this app is useless. Not gonna spend money on premium version just to find out if it works. | GREAT APPS!!!! I just random to search on Playstore 'Packing List' and see I found this app. Thank you. | This app is quite helpful. It really helped me stay organised and made my packing easy. | Love PackPoint! | Awesome packing checklist | No horse riding options | Love it! | I just purchased the premium version so that I could customise the lists. I believed it would be easier to have the lists in clothes, shoes, electronics, plus the activities. It is not easy to use the app, there is no way to customise the lists, you cannot rename the lists. It is not very intuitive or user friendly. | Makes packing so much easier. I get packing paralysis...where I just sit and try to think of all the things I am going to forget. This app removes that and helps me pack quickly. | Amazing | I been using this app for years it is must have for any travel I love it so helpful | Missing many items. Unable to edit existing catalogue except for adding items (can't rename or move them). Paid for premium but it's just not worth it. Would like a refund | Great app to keep you organized when packing! | It's alright you just have to customize it a little. | I can't retrieve the packlist of my last travel !!!!! | I like the app a lot and am trying to upgrade to the premium option but it doesn't work. :( | I like it but it would be nice to sync it across devices | Just started using it, but I like what I'm seeing | It's a good app, but whenever I go to the purchase screen to upgrade it so I can get the full experience it freezes up. I don't know if this a Google issue or what. | Things disappear and other items never appear. Gotta try something else | Very nice, I use all the time! | This app does not have all requirements That's why I found a another app that's so cooolllll | this is exactly what i was looking for, just a simple packing app that wont clog up my notepad - the suggested items are helpful as well | OK list app. But basic things are missing such as link to buy premium or a help feature for how to customize or add new categories. App says I can customize but after much typing of a new category, app does not save. | So dissapointed in premium! Paid some money to have option to add new activities and create new list but it doesn't work! A ""+"" button is not active! Furthermore, I could not find any contact to write creators without commebting it here. | Great overall experience. The communication was good. They lay out the process, costs, etc, very well. The application process is straightforward. Underwriting and closing went well. They assign an account rep to help you through the process. I found them to be responsive and helpful. A decent balance of phone and email communication. This shared equity route is not for everyone but has value in certain circumstances. | Helps me to reduce my packing time. Works for all seasons and events . Saves me from forgetting items. Allows me to add items specific to my needs. | Not worth $3. No features. No multicity support. No sorting into bags. Could literally do better faster with an excel spreadsheet. | Easy to use | I like the preintalled packing list with the ability to customize and the weather averages. | Love that this is a 'to do' list just for traveling... | Really helpful for a busy mind traveller. | Easy to use. | Helpful. Some items are outdated but I like it as a packing guide. | I hate packing, this is brilliant and makes it so much easier. It even tells you the weather of where you'll be going. | Easy to use | overall great app, items preset and can add your own to tailormake it! would like options to edit and delete items. | Great app | Loving it so far. | Great app | Best app | Good and useful application.simple UI is easy to use for almost every age group. | I wish there was an area to make a shopping list of items needed from the suggested list. | Very helpful app. | Has everything I need | Easy to use and great lists | I have used this app for a long time now. Detailed packing lists while not being overly complicated! Great app. | You will never forget anything again. | I have used this app for years. I have recently found a new app that I like much better. My complaint with Packpoint is that you can't edit your lists. None of the items can be changed without deleting everything. Even then, you can't edit the pre-suggested items to make the list your own nor can you edit any item you have entered. I will unfortunately be moving on to the new app which I can customize as needed. Thank you, Packpoint, for your past service. It's PackTeo for me now! | Great for camping. I can customize different item lists to have presets I can choose depending on the location. Love that it estimates the weather too. | Amazing so helpful I love this app I travel a ton and it's so great | Good | Great app! | This app is great. | Great app | It generates a basic list, easy to edit that list. Helps my mom brain to remember everything! Practical and helpful. | Is really cool I don't have to do my list on paper anymore and I'm able to see even things or stuff that I have to add that I never think about it | Great auto generated lists | User friendly. | It reminded me of essential items to pack. Thank you! | Sucks paid for the deluxe version and it doesn't work. Waste of $2.99 | Super useful for planning trips | Have been using this app for years! Very helpful. | Does the job really well; I always pack in less than 30 mins even for weeks long trips. But could use a total UX and UI overhaul. | great so far only just downloaded | Your app is missing option to have activities for Spiritual trips visiting temples or sacred places | Great app, love the interface. Well done. 👏👏👏 | Packing list I got was full of useless things. I'll make my own list. | Good but they need more options for activities you would be doing on a trip | Good | Always to the point on information needed. | Works great and keeps me organized | Just downloaded it a few days ago and paid for the premium features, mostly for the widget and presto chango, the widget is gone. I uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache and data. Just poof gone. | Super helpful | Not saving the new items added all of a sudden! | Don't know where this app has been all my life. I can see areas for improvement but it is on the right track. | Very useful for Travelling | Love how you can add different items and check them off as you pack | Does exactly what I needed, clean and easy to use | Would like to create a list for other members of my family, in addition to mine. | Really awesome recommendations on here, very organized and easy to use. | GOOD: Tripit integration, cool UI. BAD: 1.Can't edit template items' names. Spelling mistake? Delete-then-re-entry. 2.Can't reorder list items so again have to delete-then-add in preferred order (grrr). Need most important stuff high in list (insulin) less important lower in list (drink bottle) 3. New phone, lose all your templates (grrrrr, what did I have on essentials again). Should backup & restore from Google drive. 4. Beta program does no new features, just minor fixes | Only did free version but worked well except that you can't seem to delete things completely so if you misspell something you are still left with 3 versions of it | This app make my all trip easy | Travel has always stressed me out for two reasons- 1. What time to leave for the airport and 2. What to pack. This app has made packing a breeze and stress-free. I upgraded to the paid plan and it was well worth it. I also use TripIt and it connects to that app which is really convenient. When I used it for the first time it knew that it was for a trip to Barcelona.

Look no further. I am impressed with the information it contains within the app. All in one app for travel planning. | Es la Mejor app para viajes, lo tiene absolutamente todo! | Update: The suggestions I put forward are now in place, and for me the missing piece of a complicated trip involving multiple forms of transport, accomadation and activities all in one place and easy to access, thankyou So far all been great, messaged them with a question/suggestion and they have been very open to this which is always helpful | The app is great, it allows any kind of macro- or microplanning for a trip. Fits my usecase perfectly. I have one gripe though: train transports in Japan seem to not calculate routes correctly - a train connection is simply shown as a straight line from A to B. I don't much care for which exct connection I end up taking, but I'd like a rough route shown just as with car trips. | I had an issue where my trips ""disappeared"". I contacted support through the app, they put me onto a tech specialist who dug through the obstacles and fixed the problem much faster than I could have reasonably expected. Great service. | I think it's the best trip planner in store. Please add support to Japanese and Chinese language. The app tends to change the place name from local language to English to display. | I added 14 flights to my trip, updated the destination and everything deleted. If you do not pay for premium and you lose internet acess while travelling, the app will not let you access any information you stored. And you obviously cannot upgrade without internet. This app became useless when I needed the info most. | Very complete, very useful to gather all the trip details in one place. Missing features to me: one calendar view, in addition to the existing agenda view. And a detailed resume of the whole trip (in the app, not as pdf) | Keeps freezing for me and a friend's phone. Unusable. | the best trip planner, and TOTALLY WORTH IT | Extremely buggy don't recommend | Sadly not great. It's really clunky and not user friendly. I tried to add our Airbnb and I could only add the address and then I still had to search for it and the programm couldn't find it so it was only added as waypoint. When you search for ""museum"" it searches for it in other countries and when you Klick on the map you can not view what a point is a put you just get asked to add it directly. I have tried to make it work but I found it completely unusable | Bersama Di Wilayah Celcom BERSAMA DI WILAYAH CELCOM | excellent app for tracking your journeys | Love it. Easy to use and makes planning a trip so much better | Awesome app, my only complaint is that I wish there was a tab for hotels or AirBnbs like the tab for transportations. EDIT: I mean a tab just for hotels to put the bookings numbers.. a special marker on the map.. etc just like the transportation tab. | Out of all travel planning apps we found this one to be the best. It shows you distance between locations, has good suggestions in-app and you can easily add activites day by day. I liked that at all times you can see what your trip looks like on map, to get a good sense of distances and make best decision for your trip. Gladly purchased the pro version for our next trip. | Great App for planning tours | Still a work in progress, but the development team is remarkably responsive. This is certainly slated to become the staple travel planning software. | Can't even get started because the app refuses to let me do anything because my start location is ""behind"" my destination, whatever that's supposed to mean. | I can't deselect notifications in app, have to go via phone settings to not get daily reminders that I've created trips. I know that, really annoying. Distance between stops is measured in straight lines, not following the roads (extremely useless). It's anything but intuitive to create a roadtrip yourself, I will take some more time again on the weekend but will probably delete the app again. | 10/10 app Also to mention the developer is super nice !! | Love this so much I'm excited to use this app for my friends holiday it is so helpful and I bought the Pro so I can't get checklists and it's perfect I have everything I need all in one spot | Pity not available offline on the free version....otherwise great app | I have submitted negative review earlier due to lots of bugs with pro version, which has been resolved lately. Good customers support and very useful app to plan and organise a trip, either shared or individuals. | It doesn't take you to your destination via roads, it just shows how you can get there as the crow flies. Not very useful considering the activities and attractions I would want to add wouldn't be along a route of this type. Super confused about how people find this app useful. I must be missing something but I feel like I've tapped every button at this point and it just keeps wanting me to travel in a straight line. | super | Overall the app is great but it would be more if I can view all my trips at one page rather then switching between cards. Also there are no option to group or classify the trips between Visited and Want to Visit. | -Nice pix for places (POIs) -Nice suggested places! -No ability to add line for dep/arr times, unless w Notes. Only has date in small font for itin. item; also want big font date above. -Transport. options are many w own icon; but section icon is airplane. -Itin. building too focused on waypoints vs POIs. Wish could toggle to enter POIs only, for specific item rather than selecting item from list and whether waypoint or POi (can add either w list or from map). -""reviews"" at bottom; don't need. | I love this app! It's definitely my favorite travel app so far. But I have a few suggestions. A way to add a hotel other than a location- like something with a different color code (maybe purple) that shows up below the location and above the other things planned in the itinerary. Another thing I'd look for would be a way to add excursions!! They could show up with the ""nearby places"" and you could enter a name, company, location, time, etc that allows you to see everything you have planned. | As a travel app, I find it pretty bad. There is a date interval for a waypoint, but no hour interval, only a fixed hour. How to plan a day's activities in the same city, then? Can't have itineraries and distances between locations within the same city, so useless on the ground. Itinerary doesn't display any of the addresses, have to click for address, then back. Click, back. So unwieldy and frustrating. How did it get such high scored reviews? I don't know. | I tried using this app, but it is not functioning as it should. I added a couple of connections between way points, but when adding a third connection, the previous two disappeared. I found myself entering the same information multiple times in order to adjust my itinerary and I finally gave up, because it's just not practical and you can't edit items effectively. I also wasn't able to add my traveling documents from storage. The screen just froze. | This app is nifty and helpful, but it could be much better. If you make a timeline and decide you want to add something in the middle you basically have to start over. Also since I decided to go ahead and try for the ""pro"" version it keeps crashing and takes a long time to load. | This app is amazing! I tried 10 different apps and this was the best one. It is also the only one that can help you if you have not totally decided where you want to go. They have a very impressive selection of recommended tour locations to help you decide. But if you already know, they can also help you plan a great itinerary with places to see, and have tons of features. And I especially impressed when I found a small glitch. I reached out to them (they are very friendly) and they fixed it 😃 | This is a great app so far! My issue with it is the map itself. I am located in the U.S. where distance is measured in miles. The issue that I'm having is the map within Lambus and Google Maps are not matching up. For example, Google Maps estimates my travel distance to be 802 miles whereas Lambus estimates the distance to be 730 miles. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but it's preventing me from having an accurate itinerary. Keep up the great work (: | НАКОНЕЦ-ТО! удобное приложение для планирования маршрута, с накидыванием точек, фоточками, доками и проч! структура внутри приложения оч ложится на моё видение как надо планировать - сначала намечаешь какую-то относительно большую зону (город), куда поедешь, а потом накидываешь точек, что в этой зоне интересного есть посмотреть! и нет всяких проплаченных отелей и проч рекламы! | I was beginning to like the app; however I found a lot of discrepancies between the built-in map and the Google map which is really confusing. Further I can't locate some places I want in the map :( Ability to add a hyperlink in the notes section would be great! | excellent! app best app to create trips with friends ! | Nice with almost everything in one place. However, while adding the expenses I am forced to select one of the existing categories and cannot write my own. For example, I eat at a restaurant and spend 26€ then I must select restaurant as a category rather than being able to write the name of the restaurant (no customization). I opted for other apps in this situation. | Peace of ... | The collaborative approach to trip planning is what I was missing from features like Google Trips, so I'm was very excited to find this app! The design is very clean and sleek. I wish that there was a way to organize Waypoints based on destination (ex: attractions vs food vs shopping, etc.) to more easily distinguish areas on the map at a glance. | Absolutely love it | Awesome App | Superb app! Highly recommend for travel planning and expenses calculation. | I have been looking for an app like this for ages, I love to travel and this is a great way of keeping track of places I want to visit. The map view make it really easy to navigate and helps me plan an itinerary. The app easy to use and you can input lots of notes and information (so you can easily save tips and recommendations you hear about certain places). The attractions section is really helpful too as you can see what trips, tours and key sights places have to offer | It's really good at what it does, 4/5 stars because it auto assigns icons to itinerary items and doesn't always get it right, so it bothers my OCD that I can't edit them manually. Also a feature I would love to see implemented is car parking category with drop-off and pickup itinerary objects like you have for hotel check-in and checkout 🙂 | I like the idea of this but the App isn't always obvious to navigate. There should be an itinerary section. | Highly recommend for travel expenses calculator and making points where to go when | I'm using this app to plan my trip to Patagonia, and is just amazing, the best app for this. | Pretty good, I like the waypoint system, but the money section is confusing. | Picking and choosing locations on this app is great! Also sharing plans with friends is super easy. I enjoy the notes section to which helps to add on info that you dont want to forget about a certain place or location. I wish there was an option to change the color of the waypoints so you could put them into different categories. I also would have hoped to see the routes and a ""starred location"" that could lead routes from a particular location. | Great usability | It doesn't order automatically the dates of the itinerary. Also, it doesn't change the itinerary date if I change the trip date | Awesome app, easy to use with great and helpful feature! | Nice App to plan my interrail trip, good support, actively developed! | Such an amazing app to help set things up with a group of friends! Makes things so much easier | Great | A simple checklist can make the app perfect | So far so good in pre planning stage. However, when adding waypoint I wished there's an option that prompt us that we have added 'the place' before and if we like to add again. I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places. | Just started trip very good | Exactly what I've been looking for! This is a fantastic app that will allow you to simply plan every detail of your vacation. | The invitation flow is bad.. The link I got told me to open the app, hit the + button and put in the code. No link to the app on that page, no deep linking to just auto handle adding the trip. Some really low hanging fruit that would make the initial experience wayyyy better. After I downloaded the app manually, there was no plus sign fab until she had already added me manually to the trip by username, then the fab appeared. Overall beautiful design though! I really want this app to improve! :) | Easy to use | Best All-in-One Travel App | This app is great for trip planning, spending and keeping everything in one place. I have used it slightly differently in that I have recorded the information for trips I have done and while being on a trip. this has worked extremely well but I would like two additions. -to be able to add dates in the past (the app shows current dates and those in the future. -to be able to transpose the notes I have made to my computer. -I don't use my phone for e-mails and would like to be able to add documents to the app via my computer. Is any of this possible? It would be perfect if it could be! | It's great app for people like travel | Amazing and responsive customer service. I struggled to find an app that was simple yet powerful without trying to be clever, to keep track of travel plans. I finally found Lambus. One of the main features I was after was being able to store documents for the trip in a nice organised way. The only issue I had with the app was that trips were sorted by last edited rather than time. I asked the developers about it and a couple of days later it was in the latest release. Truly great customer service | So far, so good. I love that all our docs are in one place! We're in the middle of planning stages and I'm anxious to see how well the expenses work out for everyone | Really helps in managing trips with many useful features | Awesome | ok | I just returned from a 6-day Banff-Jasper- Calgary group trip yesterday and found this app recommended by Google Play. We were four families of 11 people. I created a trip and added all the waypionts. We uploaded many photos. The only suggestion for improvement is not to compress the photos uploaded and to allow downloading photos uploaded by other members in the same trip. Anyway, this is an app which will definitely help you plan, organize and document your group trip. l highly recommend it. | Cool! | Best app for planning trips with all the useful functions you can need both ahead of and during travel. | ok | Initial setup review - easy to register with Fb Google or own email. Straight into the app to register a trip. You can set your own title and the example uses the date of the trip. I did the same and the next input was the date of my trip, using a calendar, which began at today's date. It would have been helpful if it could take the date in the title as the starting point. Other participants were next and the app wouldn't recognise their emails if they had a space at the end. Many thanks. | nice see | Have to give one star for now. App freezes at login/register screen so can't even give it a try. Galaxy S7. | The idea is great and I look forward to improvements but it let me down when I tried to use it for international travel. There is no offline mode so I lost access to documents when I needed them. | just say excellent | app gets frozen when trying to create an account or connect via Google. Buttons are not responsive | great app, wish you could organize the itinerary a bit better | Planning my vacations in Brasil on your app is intuitive and easy | It has never been so easy to plan a trip | nice and useful app | What to add/change in future patches: Providing a way to change the date format from day-month-year to month-day-year, plus others. Actually changing the currency format when currency is set to something different. USD doesn't look like this example 9.50$. It should be like this $9.50. That symbol is always in the front of the numbers even for small change. It's not a deal breaker, but it can be for some people. Familiarity is important for this. People need to feel comfortable using your app. | great app for travelling! | The look is amazing. Expecting many more features in the future. Gonna plan my next trip on Lambus. | This is perfect app for traveling! | very nicely built mobile product | the idea is awesome but we are expecting features like notifications in group trips when ever some one make some updates on the trip","{""1"":90,""2"":54,""3"":216,""4"":198,""5"":1171}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,true,"$3.99 - $89.99 per item","5.0","5.0","VARY","Lambus GmbH","8170521690752506433","hello@lambus.com","https://www.lambus.com","Albert-Einstein-Str. 1

Never let us down, always delivered a fantastic service | I have used Viator Tours for many year abd in many countries! it's a great go to for well planned trips as well as quick getaways. I highly recommend it! sincerely, SAJ-a world traveler... | very trusted company with amazing vendors | Easy to access | easy and fast | Great site! Great options! Good price! | So far I reserved to pay later. I hope it works out well. | love Viator, great tour and service. I used Viator all through the Mediterranean. Had No problems | this app never let's me down | It won't let me sign in - it sends an email - I click the link and it wants to send me an email again | easy app great tour | Difficult | not good experience | I made my Viator booking on my Google browser. I paid for it and got a confirmation email. The email said to click for the ticket that I need to give to the tour operator. That link took me to the app. But I made a typo on my email upon downloading, and it wouldn't let me correct my email because it said it was already in use. Tech support got me the needed ticket, but couldn't fix the app. So,I am locked out of my Viator account by the app. I can never book through Viator again because of this. | They will try to misguide you in every possible way. Please take extra caution while booking. Please check the language and wordings 5 times before booking anything. | easy to navigate this site | los mejores precios y las mejores actividades! | helpful | Always great tours at reasonable prices | Geez, went to website for 3 minutes and received 7 emails and offers within an hour, have fun in the spam folder | wanted to pay for all in one bill couldn't as had to each one 🤔 | I bought a ticket thinking it was a cheaper ticket and when my credit card was charged it was in US$ not AUD$ very tricky I ended up paying $10 more instead of saving $6 very disappointed on my first purchase with Viator | easy and convenient to plan your trip activities | we are always pleased with the tours we book through Viator | Great selection of tours, easy bookings! | So Easy, so many options, great cancellation policy. This is the second time im using them and will continue thru our travels | Anna was a wonderful guide who both educated and encouraged a deeper perspective of the artists life and work. | I've been using Viator exclusively to book adventures for my first visit to Japan and it has not disappointed one bit. I've booked guides/hikes/tours in 3 major hubs in the country and each one has been amazing! | very easy to navigate the application | we use Viator for our Maui trip and wasn't disappointed so now we're using it for our Miami trip | This app doesn't work, it keeps saying to retry because there is no internet. There is but it doesn't connect. | wow so amazing. even seen hippos fron the helicopter. everyone was very friendly. | Our tour was fantastic! The guides and the driver were very knowledgeable. Accessing the towns via the sea was efficient and beautiful. We had time to shop and have a lovely lunch. I would definitely recommend this excursion as an alternative to a ship's excursion. | They don't confirm that your booking is available. You get an emailed link the day before your activity. When you click ""get ticket"", you are told to call the local agent to see if they can schedule you. That's right, you book a date and time, pay, and you still aren't booked. There is no reason to use this lousy service; book from the source EDIT: I have called and emailed 4x for a refund and am still waiting 5 days later. Customer service is not helpful. | Easy to install... lots of options | very helpful, and accommodating | Used in US and Mexico. Great options! | Great App & Very Good Service. | Absolute cheats, for a rooftop flying dress photoshoot in Istanbul, Viator charged me 306 USD when I went to the place (Takht Istanbul) the actual price was 175USD, every thing Viator sells is jacked with prices than actual. It's only a platform to fool with duping glorified pictures. Use local websites/call reservations for booking. Viator platform only increases cost to more than double. I fail to understand why tripadvisor is spoiling their reputation by associating with Vitator. | glad we had Khan, our guide. very very recommended! 5 stars! | so simple to book your trips | it's easy to book a trip | I'm learning how to use Viator for the first time 👍🏿 | Great Customer Service | Terrible, keeps saying get tickets in app then when go to app does not go to booking . | We exclusively us Viator. We have never been disappointed. | always have a good experience with a viator tour | great service and easy to use. | very good pricing for future trips | difficult to find tickets | so easy to use and prepare | viAtor! | Unneeded middle man that gave me wrong info from tour operator and caused me to miss my tour, while blaming the operator and myself | Viator makes it really easy to make reservations. | SCAM. Do not expect to receive any help from them if you ever need it. Lost more than $100 on a booking where the tour operator simply wouldn't reply, and Viator said there was nothing they could do about it. | easy peasy install | Great site and awesome tours. | easy booking | Great options and prices. | very easy to use | I really recommend 🙂 so much fun 🥰 | good service, love it | Terrible, terrible app and company. Booked a tour and pickup, app told me the wrong time and I missed the entire experience. Absolutely no support or refund despite reaching out several times. Highly recommended reaching out to local tour companies directly rather than using this kind of 3rd party just looking to squeeze more money from you | Great pricing and easy to use. Also, very safe payments | Easy to use | so easy to book | Fantastic range of choices all over the world, and come good price discounts! | Love this for any travel arrangement! A treasure to have. | excellent service | I'm me to this app and it was very user friendly. I really appreciate the ease of use. | beautiful views !! | so awesome and so excited we have never never been disappointed we have had the best time thank you | I love the fact that I can reserve my tours or adventures without paying any money up front and that I can pay it off in advance of the due date if I want. I also love the fact that I can make changes to my trips without it costing me extra money. I also love the fact that you earn vacation points to use on another trip. | Bought tickets here at more of double price than in the venue. VIP blah blah, and we ended up in the corner of the theater | The app scams with promo codes. Sends you an email offering a code for first booking valid for 2 weeks. But somewhete in small font it says it's valid for 1 week only :( | With ease, and very happy! | Excellent experience using Viator. | nice | Not trustworthy! We booked tour in the apps and it was confirmed, and we were charged. However, there was no one to pick us on the date. We called tour operator and they said they have told Viator that the tour was cancelled for long time. We ended up wasting the whole afternoon because of the faulty of this company. We logged the complaint and they did not compensate anything for their fault. | excellent | great site for finding fun things to do at your destination | I like the ease of finding interesting tours | easy to use everywhere that I visited | easy to book! | Always a great and trusting tour. I've been all over Europe and I always use Viator. | This is a fraud company that cancels your bookings and then never gives back your refund. I have been hearing thier excuses for past 4 months now without any refund provided. Thier team only keeps saying we are looking into the matter and 4 months is also not enough for them to look into it and give a refund. I would not suggest this company for any trip bookings. They have the worst services | WARNING: DO NOT USE VIATOR - Scam risk. My tour operator through Viator changed the trip that I booked, reducing the itinerary at the last minute. I was informed of this change after their cancellation window passed. When I contacted Viator customer support with the screenshots and evidence, they were completely unhelpful - they literally told me to take what was being offered or cancel and lose money. I lost money. Also, don't trust the ratings on the app - it's cherrypicked by Viator. | Will not give me my tickets! | The ""Hole in the Rock Cruise & Island Tour - with 2 Island Stopovers"" by Island Geyeway Tours, was canceled without any notification. The confirmatoon & the ticket are still online. I only knew that the tour was canceled when I showed up at the meeting point. Refund via the credit card should been done as soon as possible. Putting me on other tour on the other date does not help! Alissa | THE BEST. | really easy to book. | So i showed up for a booking. The guide did not. Apparently no refund is available. I explained again, im not cancelling - i just did not receive what I purchased. Again, no refund - ""kindly, deal with it"". These guys! 🙄🙄 tread with caution fellow humans they are morally destitute. | this is a great way to get my trip set up! Tons of great options. | great prices | Consistently advertise activities from shady vendors that very frequently cancel and then have to fight with viator for refunds for services NOT rendered. Beware, before using their ""service"", it often ends without you getting what you bought. | it was a very informative tour. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable of the area around the palace as well as in the palace. There was a line at security but it went fast. We did go through the shorter line for tour operators vs. the general public line. The tour guides voice is directed into a device you wear around your neck along with disposable headphones. If you have higher quality headset with standard 3.5mm jack, you would be able to hear better. | easy peasey to use and a great deal | App very easy to use. 5***** | too good 👍 👌 | Great choices, ease of booking | Our tour guide today Berlin is multi- talented. She speaks good English, knows the history well, has good time management. Most importantly, she fulfills my culinary adventure in Suzhou. Blaire who assists her is also patient and has good photography skill. Overall I applaud this company for this amazing day. | Very easy to use and has all the info you need. Lots of interesting tours. | my go to travel app | easy to book | Fred made this easy! | The link to view tickets doesn't work. I was forced to download the app. | Basic app. | Lavi and Roberto were fantastic hosts. The vineyards, wines, food and information were well balanced to keep you moving and provide groups time to enjoy where they were at. We'd highly recommend this tour - and, world likely go again, even if it was exactly the same. | super easy to book, pay, and get confirmation and all from one place instead of going to each destination and booking | Easy to maneuver ... lots of good recommendations! | Easy to book & so far it works and has worked nicely for me through this company. | Awesome app! | I've used viator across the world. Always easy to book. | Booked a tour for £100 for Colloseum, Rome. and no one appeared at the pickup address. No answer on chat, snd the call number is in Las Vegas. No refund as well. So it is a scam. Avoid it! | Sketchy AF. They emailed me a coupon code for $25 that never worked. Spent 40 mins on support chat inside the app until they just gave up. Support then said I could get 5% off my entire Booking if I added more to my cart. Not a new coupon code, but somehow a magic discount if I spent more money? Insulting. And ask the prices are marked up. Just book with local businesses. This app is textbook rent seeking. It should be banned | I don't know where to start. It's just horrible it's definitely an app full of scammers and I am pretty sure the app itself scams people. Trust me don't use it. I came to spain for a tour which ended up being cancel a night before. Now I can't get the tour. And almost got scammed since they tour company asked to book the tour again outside the app. Im surprised the apps dont regulate scammers. So please dont use the app!!! | Steer clear. Three days after receiving my booking confirmation (and after I had booked non-refundable accomodation) the operator cancelled my booking without notice. I emailed to request alternative tour with no response. Viator did absolutely nothing to help resolve the situation other than waste my time on endless and circular support chats. There is no incentive for operators to keep your booking and so they appear to cancel bookings to resell tickets for more $€ | Easy-to-use | always use viator, never had a bad experience. | it with great pleasure to be back with Viator. Viator fixed all the things I needed when I was in Morocco last February 2024. Viator services was excellent then. | They actually granted me a full refund within the 24-hour mark. Wasn't able to go on the trip for unexpected circumstances, but at least I received a refund. | Excellent | Great options on fantastic adventures. | I have used this app to travel in US, Canada, and Europe. It's always an amazing experience. I would not travel without it. | OVERPRICED. Every single tour I booked would have been 15-20% cheaper had I booked locally, from train rides to tours. Not only that, if you book locally, you get better times & more flexibility from operators. When I asked why, everyone said it's b/c Viator charges up to 35% in fees. No one likes dealing w/ them. WORSE: If you cancel, they hold your money for WEEKS, not DAYS. Customer service is a useless! Use the app for research at best, but DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM if you want the best deal. | I could not complete the reservation at first due to the pages not working. | Very easy! | Blah. We learned a little. | Love booking with Viator whenever I travel. Trustworthy, so many options and unique experiences and rewards towards future bookings. | great app | easy to use | so much fun stuff at your fingertips! | love this app! | quick efficient and easy | Wonderful experience so far:) | easy to use, with lots of options | Really enjoyed the tour. The guide was so knowledgeable and personable. Highly recommend thus tour then a stop at Cafe Du Monde for beignets. | This is so easy and extremely helpful to book tours. | Ive used Viator for several activities in many cities. it's been excellent | great way to travel | Great straight forward | excellent | easy to use! | Excellent way to explore and find attractions you may not have even known about. | Have been a happy customer for 15 years. Well run, professional, informative, fun, safe | The service is excellent, really user friendly and very helpful when changes are required. The refund was also received very quickly with no fuss thanks | Love the Reserve now pay later! | love love love","{""1"":420,""2"":95,""3"":325,""4"":2302,""5"":28588}",0,,,true,"USD","Free",true,false,,"8.0","8.0","VARY","Viator","Viator","mobileappsupport@viator.com","https://m.viator.com/",,"https://m.viator.com/support/privacyPolicy","Viator","Travel & Local","TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","[{""name"":""Travel & Local"",""id"":""TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL""}]","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N3He9pc5BH83Pog2Y1nju81DBFzmTifnzeNQPqqVjlkjvnSAK_v8ejC6dXuAS5nW1B3a","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/thkUuBYxeZmM2zX3qKc0ieMgABlKqwW-bI5wwrt3AoIdRgW3oHZSyTjnVZBPzfsVKK7Z","[""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ls01xaCQFLB5afwC3qwg3lwuzh6-dIXxH58rbuoW2uYPN0FlPLIRsaQ74_ykwK25xUyg"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7et26vEtOn2JGJGS-GJ0ucOHv7vp3-xn-91jejfNogHJ9LY3_33EZ7Jz6jaM7hD8EiM9"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dqAUgzSF5_R4EV7g-M71qUm36SCUP7BLY0fzgxumSFV1_tuvK07oCPI1cV2FTx9qA4Xy"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q5OLcWQXYcM-AFjyy65O2q3kVvsuTapj4dF5fBJ7leldTvdVMrX4K10mW82ENFAlKo0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Jj2SMaiXbMAQXNaARR7BXCDRFVKAUDluEBPYSEulMvkoOO6D2d3FwTXJ-C-qw5oKJQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/e3SUu1reYStIUniROleDq-F6NzLMk3IUgrGAHKLMPmXRCbHlIE4OORdA-ft3R07JL8k"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XPoNgqcgRKBT6j1tND1zd1LKFYGrHHYgbAzhfdmu6FC70DXuX66SqGFWWItiYIAYcTHt"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gjDfxjn4Pvn5NeqTBovxygpezlUoiLUK5OxkDSg1njuhvBT0720_mmbp_xKuqTGuVsbS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/93MRZh2q3QTeMuYH26KOwm1RFQTIfmhvfXc6GajFBp0lDbBJC-T7xoksDeiBXURIq6Q3"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9sT238kN1IcMtzh7RnTcJ9usKXVvRjewFk7DLGmlz-1k5FYbQgkwNpjbhYfAiJ6gQ98r"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/23VUMUQvYKhtUzVwZ4Uopnl-9kvRIWAB37CUX_c9XS-lFlwUWPovR1B4KrDnXXbjijU"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ru83QYT3MV7wXuVAtmFqWoheWv2GQsNxHsW_o2i2vt5mbb8NwjCSpxF0qV2vSO3_vHE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XMWUt_k9fWnLXfcvrTuLod5NXoZi99thqKMgC1WkJU_0cnEPzIrQggdGN9e5FhCEg-VS"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KsnRrUWAAZu2_tpCjOCZLcE0uiTlNhpdSIjLwQiwfHn9RY6NccIoONZKLxs5ic7cJJj0"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8XuWmkR5hAhr9RNiLIEiGjUBF7wIIdE9iYJNhuFVrCU8qlZ9rUETDchNIYwqsuOIBvQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mkf2dZFzL3U1a80_tZ6GhIzA5iyre1uZqVOEGWOcNYneJxBKWoaUHQR2iKxHf9PUjPs"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cvLRZvF8UPlrW7AHtiKY3VBHm1PZP0cKnu9QOsQERkg8jEnjVGYERWNN6AjW4qwqyQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QKmOnlR9ab6qW_rIBeUF-BYcYAS2CxzJvaH6Lepb8Kw0a6L6fOXN47EVByXdppf6zzE"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Sw0-H3aRMgs79r-E0Xj1TG8WDimPrbk5P5smv2CcFMXV_nF1R5qcldebUVeXTwORmPFi"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OJZo-wZaVWWTcqGO1LzzUK1fIn0u_wTfXJOZZzU0GLpouSH1hjDcL-ig4PRYY0gtVQ"",""https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ojuill_szuKXncuvYm48E6Q1LituJi9OOLiBdrhc_m5GbXUjJmnfaWP6plGCJx7m0Za5""]","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfMs86Gx_IE?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/thkUuBYxeZmM2zX3qKc0ieMgABlKqwW-bI5wwrt3AoIdRgW3oHZSyTjnVZBPzfsVKK7Z",,"Everyone",,false,"Nov 12, 2012",1713344804000,"13.6.0","This update includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

So it's basically useless since I'm not going to scroll through hundreds of cruises hoping that I come across my port eventually. | I've used Expedia for years and it's never failed. Great deals and Customer Service is excellent at assisting with any last minute changes. | love it | good clean rooms for good prices 👌 | Always logs out in the middle of bookings.

Reasonable rates, clean, great service. | Not happy that Expedia's app has been hacked, so that I can be sent dodgy links advising my payment has failed?! Thank you for your response - in the meantime I have deleted my credit card details from your app and changed my password. | 😎 | 👍👍👍👍👍👍 | Cannot set the language based on country. So good luck if you set up an account in Italy but can't speak Italian | Expedia leaked my hotel booking and itinerary number and I received a fraudulent request for my credit card details DIRECTLY from the Expedia app. After a number of complaints, I am still waiting for any sort of explanation from Expedia. Update to Expedia: you keep putting messages on here asking me to contact you. Phoned again 7 days ago having not had this resolved in 3 WEEKS and have had no explanation despite being promised one. Expedia cannot be trusted to deal with their own data breach. | the scammiest website with no human support | I get better prices than Booking or Kayak | it's good but prices are too expensive | good | una De las mejores app que puedo confiar. | very good application | the app is unable to fit my upcoming trips. | always travel with Expedia. | excellent | Easy to use app | Easy to book my vacations and customer service is great | Omg I'm so annoyed with this app after thinking it had so much potential. They kept rejecting my payment despite my card information being correct & they kept saying it's incorrect even if I input the right info over and over only for them to change the price on the initial flight I was trying to book and recommend a more expensive flight! I'm done! I'll find other options! ✌🏼 | Rooms are clean and large enough, comfortable AC, coffee provided. Signage isn't great, actually had a hard time figuring out where the room was 😆 Bus to airport is regular and very convenient. | easy to use | easy to use | not always great value | easy to use and understand | Brilliant, love using Expedia for all my travel bookings. | Convenient and handy. | Plenty of options with easy-to-use filters and price monitoring. Good rewards. | 11 definitely, and I think it is the best way to rent cars 🚗 and hotels 🏨... | Great app!! | When I'm signed in and try to see all trips it takes me to a sign in page which will not allow me to sign in. I'm only able to view my next stay, not my entire itinerary. Very frustrating and virtually useless. | very easy and price is good | Best service for finding affordable stays. | good | if a room is available, Expedia will find it for you. | Room price shown, but jacked up AFTER I booked it? Cancelled it, tried again...same deal. Bait & switch? Ready to head to Booking.YEA! | Quick updates on any flight changes | I always find a great place to stay through Expedia. | good for planning travel | love it easy to plan a trip | Always find good deals on great places! | Cant log in to the app | that was the worst hotel experience in my history of hotel stays. waste of money. never again. | I enjoy with this app | Good | unable to sign in. entering email and receive code, everything accepted but when I go to my trips - getting request to sign in again. endless loop :( do not recommend | Always find good deals and customer service has always been helpful/friendly when I have had to call. | Always helpful if not perfect! Save your money! | Clear. Lots of reviews and ratings for hotels, tours, rentals, attractions, etc.. allows filtering. You can also book through them which can be helpful for small operations, which do not always have website, or websites in your language. For hotels, as well as other accommodation the ratings and details are extremely useful. Once you book through Expedia they also keep you updated. Especially, for cancellation options. They are now tied in with VRBO, so lots of available options. | Love the ease of use, filters, options, offers, range of properties, and prices. | I have used Expedia while traveling for years, and I love the easy way to book online. If I ever have a problem with the reservation (one time, thank goodness), they have been wonderful at assisting with the problem. Thank you, Expedia 😊 | Great App. So fast and easy to navigate | Facil y rápido además de ahorrar $ | I really appreciate the option to pay at the counter the day of pickup. | Orginal review deleted as Expedia and Vrbo wasn't contacted about the problem we got with the premise that was booked. But having to download a second app Vrbo when site was booked on Expedia is frustrating. | I really like using this app and it has always been reliable. | realy easy to use | very helpful | I can't login to my account. It's so stupid | love the rewards, work your way up to Gold status and receive great discounts on flight, stays, and or vacation packages. been using Expedia for quite a few years now and is my go-to sight for trips | It took quite a lot of time to book. I was rejected several times without being informed about why. | usually the best price on hotels. | I'm pleased with the new alternatives that Expedia provides during my travels. Very convenient. | The app keeps asking me to prove I'm a human and doesn't let me get past the verification no matter how many times I do it. | easy to use and easy to get connected with a agency | the best app | Hotel rates are less than using Expedia. Expedia will not adjust either. It wouldn't be such a big deal if it was only a few dollars difference, but it was a difference of $60. This experience has reminded me of why I stopped using Expedia. | whoo hoooo | very hard application to use | Great optios 😀 | when it comes to traveling they assist you in all your needs | If you have no issues with your order, everything is fine. However, if you try to talk to someone or request a response, it can be challenging. You may not be able to get in touch with the right person; instead, you might only be able to chat with workers from third countries who may tell you the conversation was disconnected and that you need to start over | I love the service | GREAT app !!! | All experience is terrible. Reps couldn't help. They make changes to your trip, and you can't use use OneKeyCash. Both website and app don't work. The frustration level is beyond imaginable. | awesome app | everything is disabled. can't get a hold of anybody | DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT USE EXPEDIA. THEY SCREWED UP MY TRIP TO THAILAND FOR MY BIRTHDAY TODAY. The virtual agent CYRUS need to be fired and I hope it gets fired. Stibin tried to help but still messed up. The flight was cancelled and I wasn't notified until 3pm. I tried to contact american airlines but couldn't contact then so I had to contact expedia. They acted like were looking for another connecting flight but they lied. I'm filing with BBB. I want my money back scammers. | pretty good app. functions well and rarely glitches. a necessity for a traveler. | find best prices | best discounts | been the best site for reliable bookings in Philippines | BAH! | This site was very easy to use and didn't push extras like some others. I like that. I will use them again in future. | Excellent App for last minute and plan ahead travel.!! | Buenos precios. good prices love ❤️ | Easy functional | I am Canadian, so tell me; what's my zip code???? This isn't the first thing I've booked by a long shot, so how have you not figured that out? I'm using a VPN and have blocked gps???? | Great options and prices | Customer service is awful. Accommodations and flights booked separately with no communication between the two. I was left stranded and was told I would be charged $1200 for an additional night at my resort. When I spoke to the resort directly it was $280 for the night. Terrible experience with customer service, being hung up on multiple times after I was stranded at the airport for a flight happening the next day. I wish I could rank them a zero. Never using Expedia again, bunch of crooks. | We have used Expedia for a few years now on multiple vacation stays. Easily navigation of app and takes lots of headache away. | ease of use very good prices | Expedia is a fantastic site even when I'm not planning an immediate vacation. it's still great for planning ahead for the family trips. | My flight got cancelled. On expedia still shows active, booked and confirmed. No notification from expdia about cancellation and not getting help at all. I do not recommend expedia at all. Do not book through expedia rather book directly through airline. | Love this App | The App is super easy and seamless to use. Easy to read and look at on the go, which is perfect for busy travel! | Nice.... If ya know what i mean. | why pound I don't know how much money got cut in my account | app works great! | love Expedia | Work poor | Charged $50 more than the prices on google maps for my hotel, deleting app and never coming back. | you can always find what you want through expedia. | Best prices! | great application | Excelente! | Very easy and good app! | If I never rent through Expedia it will be too soon. Twice. Twice in a row I've attempted to rent a car through this company and they've not had a car available when it comes time to make good on the reservation. Last time it took weeks, many emails, and I wasn't able to get a refund.
