I like the information, descriptions, pricing info, reviews, and ability to make a reservation. | Best travel review app! | I've just come back to the app after a few years break. Useful. | Good app and easy to use | How much can you trust an app that requires extra steps when you post a negative review? Whenever a negative review is posted, they follow up with an email asking to confirm it. A bunch of these have filtered to spam so I have to wonder how many people don't click that extra button? Negative reviews should be as easy to make as the positive. Majority of mine are positive but if I'm saying something negative, it was a really bad experience and the business needs to make corrections | I enjoyed my stay at the hotel And the Staff Was Awesome ‚ú®Ô∏è Everyone. I didn't want to leave. Thank You to the Fantastic Bartenders, Dave and Franklin. I hope I have his name right. And my Breakfast Crew They made my Day.

I know there are hundreds of reviews for places in Boise, but according to the app there is no such place! Uninstalled! | Hard to Navigate | It is nice to find information about new places, see pictures and get opinions from various visitors. Most of the times you can get an impression of a place or Hotel or restaurant from the reviews of other visitors. | Very informative | Thanks very nice app | We stayed in hotel The Fern Habitat Candolim Goa from 27th Feb to 5th March 2024. Newly built state of art. Reservation desk excellently handled by Miss Sainali D, Souza. Well neat and clean rooms taken care off by House Keeping. Breakfast and Dinner very yummy. Service by Miss Dipti excellent. No match for her. She is a real asset of the property. Above all General Manager Sh. Sandeep is so courteous. Homely atmosphere provided and celebrate your occasion with great enthusiasm. Lovely stay. | Good üòä | Love the itinerary planning feature | Wish i knew how the he'll tp use this app | This app is still our go-to for finding everything food and entertainment in our vacation adventure. Great place to share and help others find great opportunities for their adventure. | Good reviews...

Currently in Palermo and disappointed that many hours are not up to date and at least two closed restaurants are recommended. | Love it | Fantastic app for booking travel adventures! | Nice app | AI seems like it is a little glitchy, when I choose the word straw berry farm might be typo error, it doesn't seem to be able to find the right suggestions as mentioned above. | But the best part about this app is its functionality. It has a variety of features that cater to different needs. Whether I need to make a to-do list, set reminders, or even track my expenses, this app has it all.

It is also very handy for tips from other travelers. | Really helpful | I always rely on the reviews in Trip Advisor before I book my next vacation | It's one of the finest app which provides genuine trip advises. Loved the app | De app is prima maar ik erger mij er aan dat als je de app installeert er als appnaam \"van Tripadvisor\" staat i.p.v. \"Tripadvisor\". | Very useful app | Can always be trusted vas bases on real people's experience | App version can't open saved links, only showing as text notes, while website version can open as links | Generally useful | This app very good for me | Great information | Useful, but beware reviews that are either fake or are written with an agenda. Discount critical ones that are outliers and or are negative and written by someone who has done few. Overall, the majority tends to give the right result and the most useful reviewers are those who write many reiviews and are clearly able to add value. | Ok | It is friendly and useful | Best tacos of my life thanks to trip Advisor | My go to app for travel advice, local activities and food and drink options. Can easily save a topic or location for checking back to and adding to or review later on. A lot of users contributing makes for a great database of information.

Whenever I click Search it closes the app. Please fix this bug. | the best of the best apk | today I tried to search for hotels in Bermuda and the app told me it couldn't find a location with that name üòÇüí© I then searched for Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Seattle with the same result üëé | Newest version crashes when I hit search. | good | Very helpful to finding affordable plane tickets | very good | In Website, service good. | When I go to book it takes me to a blank grey page! | Trying out prices is great love it | Expensive site | it's great Appe to find a cheapest ticket | very good site for international travel | Everything is going to go well with you're arrangements made by the application!!!!!! | great app | Very Good App | Show the type of aircraft which will be used for the flights shown in search results. | I like it little better than Experian. I was able to find a good cheap flight pretty easily and the price notification is also a handy feature. The \"scientific algorithm to buy tickets at a cheaper price\" isn't always correct so just feel out for it and analyze yourself as it does give you a chart and a chart of probability. All in all I like more than Experian so this app is quite nice for finding good priced flights! | Kayak, my go to powerhouse flight search engine. Incredibly comprehensive and useful. Highly recommend | Don't trust this app. | Found great price for trip to Italy | I find better deals on the actual web sites | Great app with cheap prices!!! | nice üòç | excellent üëå | i love it | Best deals! | Prices are not as advertised!! I get results with cheap flights, but as soon as you click on the link to get redirected, prices jump at least a few hundred percent. Went from 149 with United to 780 once on the site. What is the point in using this app? Also won't save my CAD preference, keeps reverting to USD which is an unpleasant surprise | We aren't able to filter out specific airplane models when searching for a flight? I'd rather not risk my life flying on a Boeing. | Worst travel app ever for booking hotels , every time you click a hotel the price changes by an insane amount or half the time it says the rooms no longer available... like how stupid is this app. I won't be using any company associated with booking holdings Inc because of their bad practices . | love this site! we travel a lot and always use this site! | the app gets stuck on tap the heart for just browsing. I tap the heart and nothing happens. it is right after search flights. | I've used this app many times for searching and purchasing airline tickets and making hotel reservations. It works great for me. I usually find the best deals here. I like the flexibility with travel dates with the +/- feature, and the comparison with various airlines and hotels. I've used other apps, and I still do, but I find myself coming back to this one. | Great apps. Help us much. | This is such a great way to compare prices across the industry. I generally check multiple sites including the individual airlines and I never find a cheaper fare than Kayak. | The Best | I would say it's the best well put app made. | V good | Constantly showing false prices. Click on flight and nothing shows. Uninstalled. | love the many options and especially how kayak manages my trips! | convenient and reasonable | good üëç üëçüëçüëç | good | They should call it Kayad, as all it is is ads now. And it's not one and done. They don't cover Southwest. Price notifications are useless | Reliable site | More convenient | hard to book a flight | Easy to use. | Me encarta esta aplicaci√≥n para mi es la mejor que hay | The app is okay. But don't use it to book. My kayak booking somehow removed all of my normal perks when flying with my preferred airline (free luggage, early boarding, seat selecci√≥n). Also making adjustments to the schedule is abusively expensive. Instead of changing flights thru kayak, I just bought a new flight outright thru the airline. I received no credit for my original booking and still paid less than kayak quoted for the change. I will absolutely never book through kayak again. | My go to travel app | Just updated to newer version... now useless. Can't do searches at all.. | If the app worked maybe I could give a more positive review | good service to have | great comparison site | Minghella Me..myomyomon | I cannot even get this to download. | Uninstalled .. After so many years of loyalty. I had to uninstall with heavy heart. Kayak used to be user oriented search engine and now its another corporate machine which works only for the best deals which suit their sponsors ! Bye Kayak | Won't accept payments. I tried several different cards. | Pire application. Affiche des prix qui ne sont m√™me pas bons. On clique dessus on fait toute la manipulation pour r√©server et au dernier moment √ßa t'annonce que le prix a augment√©. Tu retournes sur l'application c'est toujours l'ancien prix. Mettez vous d'accord | Some filters simply don't work correctly which is very annoying. Similar apps momondo do work as they should | I've used this app for years and recommend it to everyone that tells me they are looking to travel! | was such a great app but it appears ryanair is no long on it so lost all interest in the flight section | Good app | I have used this app for years, never an issue until now. I went back to amend my review because customer service is almost non existent. I had an issue due to kayaks error and have not received any help. Yes I understand they link you to a site, which was the error incorrect hotel city. No help from the non existent customer service | Doesn't recognise my city as somewhere to search for flights from | whenever I click on search flights...it says pls change the date or location nd search again....every single time | Nice | Amazing | Kayak is my first stop for finding a flight. I usually cross-check directly with the airlines - especially with overseas travel. | saves money! great app | Comprehensive and easy to use. | boca raton | made for usa customers. Not Good for the World community | Still my favorite travel site, but it seems not to have the number of specials from years past. Good people's when contacted, which is exactly what I've always liked about they're site! | great App | I tried this app once to book car rental and for some reasons the pick-up and drop-off time were pre-set to 12nn and can't be changed, we decided to book anyway. It turned out that the car rental shop closed at 12nn and we were not able to get our car but still got charged for the rental plus insurance. We also learned that Kayak outsources rental to yet another 3rd party/middleman company and getting a refund is next to impossible. Just book directly, don't use this app. | kayak is the best.. more places to choose from.. | okay for flight simulations | Rental car is scam | this app used to be better before the pandemic but now it's not the same. | Great app. it offers the best and cheapest flights | really good | Lowest price hotel was triple other sites, also would only allow up to 4 guests in a room where others have allowed 6 as we required. | Cool concept, but when it told me $1800 for a ticket I can buy directly from United for $900 for the exact same flight, I lost all confidence that I'm getting the best price when using the app. | The app deceives people, you can buy tickets cheaper on other websites. I was looking at tickets from London to Istanbul. They sell a ticket for ¬£192, but Pegasus sells it for ¬£113 for the same days and times. Same airport and airlines üòÅ | I Love It.Donna Spinner | Since I have installed your app, I have used only one time. And the reason is, because when I try to find more affordable tickets your green date are often more expansive then orange and red one's. I wander why.. | Now that Expedia and Booking have bought every competitor all of these great old sites / apps like Kayak are worthless. Too bad the FTC never blocked any of these takeovers. | good | Best travel app. | Is perfect | There is no boeing filter, false advertising. That was the only reason I considered the app. | it keeps crashing | best app in the w. | Fast and easy to use. | not recommended. | works great | Very uselful | Very good indeed | Garbage no prices are correct | great | works well | Great little handy app having all your travel info in one place. Would be nice to attach a photo to your trip as the cover photo to help identify it from the others. | using kayak for years. | I really only use kayak for tracking my flights. I've never booked any flights or hotels so I can't say how good that aspect of the app is. However I've had no issues with the flight tracker, and more often than not, kayak updates any delays before the actual airport. Puts my mind at ease when I'm travelling | I rented a car and if course my car vauture was refused and its not possible to have customer service with kayak. Gotrental com was the 2nd company and the actually renter is called Alizes . avoid all those company if you can | best for finding rooms and flights | Not easy to navigate | I used this website as per my friend recommendation to get the lowest international rate.I chose justfly to book 2 tickets.I noticed a discrepancy on my phone number, so right away, I tried to correct the number. I was told that it could take 2 weeks to process the changes. I haven't received anything til now. I tried sending messages again at #justfly chat,and this time,I was told to wait 2 hours for a reply via chat?!(WOW). This company employs some of the rudest customer service ever. | Good Search Engine for booking flights | Easy to make arrangements and planning. | Works as advertised, thanks! | It seems like not all airlines are included, e.g., Southwest, but most of them are included. | the best | Best price for your assistance and high quality!!!!Thank you so much,KAYAK service!!!! | Nice app | very good pricing with good options | Convenient and up to date withany options great price search for flights, easy to use very intuitive, many features , definitely worth installing the app. | Great with the exception that every single time I wanted to use the app it would ask me if I wanted to sign in. NO, I don't want to sign in! Stop asking!! So annoying. | I've been using Kayak to fly around the world since 2015 and it never lets me down! | where's the buy or wait feature in the app? | When are you coming out with a widget for android? I notice you have it on . not android? Why? Other than that, your app is perfect. I use it to track my entire vacation timeline | üëç | Whenever I purchase ticket never have problem at All yet€î | How come your flights are ¬£600 more expensive for 2 people compared to looking on the RyanAir site for the exact same flights? Other than I've been looking at those dates a lot on the app the last few days? | I found round trip tickets from NYC to Porto in June for less than $500 each. Great app!!! | great site | buena | Reliable. Easy to Use. Good Options. I have been using Kayak for years now, and it is my go to for all my travel needs. | Great app and huge time saver | Never ever buy air ticket by OOJO agency under KAYAK APP they are frome india country they are very bad english accent you can't understannd what they telling you they charge you $250 for each ticket you purchase it they not answer to your phone most of the time . if you want to cancel your ticket for any reason they not pay your mony back they keep your mony as credit for one year valid . i did open claim for oojo to get my mony . i am absolutely disagree and unsatisfying with OOJO !!! | really fantastic apps which recommended for everyone | The app doesn't load flights under Android 10. As well now also under Android 13. It did work a short period. Now major annoyance. I have to use the browser | ‚úÖ‚ù§Ô∏èüíó | Prices say they are down, but the don't change | Good app to compare several bookings sources but it's incredibly frustrating you don't show hotels with taxes and fees inclusive. Some of your partners like Super show a deceiving low price and add huge fees making it more expensive than more mainstream sites. But even the mainstream sites need taxes included to accurately compare which is actually cheapest. | Easy to use and trust full | very good app, syncing with itinerary works very well. i wish it would update the status of our flights and tells you which gate to go in real time. would have been nice. would even pay for pro for that function! | they don't have Bulgaria as supported region | Continuously timing out | üëç | Good app for Android | I started using Kayak and never found a better site, so I never left! I love the alerts when I am shopping for cheap or best flights. thank you Kayak for being my wing-man! | good | Very good üëç | glitchy AF | I guess this app is only for US domestic travel as it cannot find flights to, or hotels in, the Caribbean. | Great app for looking up and comparing airplane ticket prices. Haven't had any issues with the app | I find it's very difficult to cancel a booking through this app | Bloatware | the best travel app for managing your vacation plans. I wish it has the ability to search by multiple arrival and departure airports like you can on the webapp | no use of this app. I am the first time customer. | This company is worsr of the worst I trai to change a flight and they charged me double, I pay for the ticket 1300 üí∏ and to change the date of flight I supposed to pay 1100 more. I asked for refund and the customer care service center told me that they could not do that. | great site all the info in one spot | Very Helpful. Thank You Kayak! | too many listings for gotcha hotel prices. | thank you kayak for everything | Best app for buy tickets to fly | Couldn't go on holiday without this wonderful app. Thank you | Great site for finding current fares. | Reliable | Extremely good five star | good developed app | slow and sluggish | Great, awesome, best,smart,real. Also, resourceful w/ A | useful app to compare hotel prices | Poor . round in circles ! | very good application | easy and cheap | Easy to use and provides useful information. Two improvements would be. 1. Include trains and busses as an alternative to flights. 2. the bag measuring tool could give dimensions in cm as well as inches as most airlines use cm | It used to work well, and I find some really good deals. Now, when I want to view the flight details, it shows the loading bar, and then a blank screen. I've checked my Internet speed, and it's fine. This happened after an update | the app is üëç the airlines are not so good on the deals | Explore feature works great. | empfehlen | I know ridiculously better rates than in the app. | the prices vary on app and PC and on PC it recognizes me as robot :( | kindly ensure that when someone cancels, refund is done immediately | Great features but needs a much better offline experience - travellers are offline in the air, and often during the first few hours after arrival when details of hotel locations and bookings is most useful. Also make the departure terminal very prominent - some airports have terminals that are very far apart so arriving at the wrong one is a bad thing. | recommended travel | It shows me options other sites don't and I have never had a problem. | this app broke three times after I had it installed. | Just super great | Easy to Use! | I've been using it for a long time and its good Thank you | Kayak offers the best possible flight prices! | perfect | very good to search flight | they were able to find me the best fare one way in a major carrier | Two stars because not All websites or companies are trusted or professional. I asked kayak to provide me email to one of those company and never replied to me. | Great tool when travelling and very accurate | can't cancel my reservation, super painful UI. called the rental place and they have no idea, made my life worse not better | Great until last update, I was in one of my trips when I got a prompt to update the app. That trip no longer comes up or displays. On other android phones that I didn't update the app march 2024 trip is there, no issues | I use other apps now. There's no way to reduce alerts to 1-2 a week. So, my inbox gets bombarded with a daily mail. The design was so much better a few years ago when it came to setting alerts. Now, I cannot even find a way to select the same airport to return to. I don't want to return to a different airport if my car is going to be parked at another! | good app | I appreciate the honesty in the app. | consistently great tool. | Good services | great app | Top","histogram":{"1":4996,"2":1517,"3":7228,"4":29406,"5":262442},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":false,"androidVersion":"6.0","androidVersionText":"6.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"KAYAK.com","developerId":"5306964836620635204","developerEmail":"android@kayak.com","developerWebsite":"https://www.kayak.com","privacyPolicy":"https://www.kayak.com/privacy","developerInternalID":"5306964836620635204","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/os2nMGSSawnCl1UOcgmggZ_Vbbv4-xzw--kaYW6iFs6gj8AEAdsgIrZS8do4ibTQVpY","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QP45Vs2fyoeJqslhnif0BQWWfF-OfR9eV5ru5oJTX-NdptHQOhpdjRkqU7bWakR7lP8","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/A8D7JN3ciQ1yZXeb7KyOl2UKBcx06b1a4_ErtP7gCRmggv4XgwW9dNqdXHVh5QL7kLEj","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3GRkzes4SqxMj5t68FmhsflL3Ri3IkekGMN9vMGXz3vOW2Yv1Ka7E1ZDnGwPQGnLMw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lyEDKbQgaT4iewMW3ER9GdkDOpwJdneAkxJVzB1o3p7UWjoZGzTQ5pi4pz3MGcAAjLk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/g8lY7pdqKDHxdIdEkiFrU9AQ1mbtJNrS7aKxGggCn7ZH9ElMgNVqTJrIaKILwVztMJY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I2R4nm57Hxk1r3wt-dr1Kxye29cKin39-djIcx_mXZUj0sN92Q5zJmAHqfjO9a-Kh4gk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ay277dGHN8FuDf3eu2zmNJGdZ_HDLjvkA-tYjfbF3hMeSyg0wJJ51JJS9I-n_sqyDvI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bCTkjwcreBVPwt67taACVDPLAHpH-Gz_YR8guLlEUEf5fTIsVXEGdGLd-WaYfoXh5BKe","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E9432i8IXvInR6fqDwICgm6s70umKo61N2GERkSmhpEU3oTplB-ATmdI6RVNlASCNPQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"updated":1710769590000,"version":"200.2","recentChanges":"Few things in life are guaranteed: death, taxes‚Ä¶ and now, getting a great deal on your flight.

A few shady listings but usually if you read the comments you can avoid the bad uns | Good app. Easy to use, good prices | Good | It's really annoying that I'm forced to use the app for some web features and it works awful. The map search is practically unusable if you want to book something in greece because number of beaches owerflow the properties (you should be able to turn off beach pins), search is reseted from time to time and you are not able to have +- days when selecting dates on app, number of crutial filters is also reduced. Theare are many more bugs, but these are the main reason I'm not using the app. | Very easy to navigate, simple and custom server time very helpful | I have been using you successfully for a number of years now but the last 2 and a half months have been exceptional, not all of the Genius places that you directed me to were exceptionally, they are cheap for a reason especially when they are supposed 4* and 5* maybe you want to check up a little better before you suggest some places. üòùüòâüëå | Excellent app | Very good app for room booking | Very good | Fantastic. | Very annoying advertisement. I have been using your app for years. I am genius level 3 and I will stop use your app because of horrible advertisement.

All places I've stayed are easy to book. | Paid for room through app took $98.12 from my account to be denied room upon arrival had to find another hotel to stay at still haven't received my money back | The messaging part of the app completely broke like 3~4 days ago... I can't load any new message from any property owner nor send them any message (Booking's customer support through the app has the same problem...) Specifically the messaging \"tab\" always has the \"One moment please...\" Error bar at the bottom.

Always good deal and never any problems with reservations. | Booking a hotel + finding a rental car has never been so easy | Excellent | ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ | The app does not provide you a Direct Contact Phone Number for Customer Service, or an Email. It requests you to log in, even if you are on the app, and go to \"Inbox\" to email, or a \"Contact Us By Phone\" and gives you the runaround. My need to contact is that I've completed 5 bookings with the app for flights and hotel stays, and they only have the two I did the last 4 days. Their Genius Loyalty/Rewards Program, at this moment in time, is Highly Suspect since you can't even contact them. | I love this app we use it all the time for spur of the moment trips | Easy way for booking mostly less in prices than others | Fast response, | Optional | This is the best app for me,I use it every time I need to make a booking | Very nice | Trusted app 100% | Superb ease of use | Awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è it really help me a lot . | Easy to use. | Horrible experience I booked and paid for my room on the app and when I got to rhe hotel, the manager tells me that the booking app over booked the room, so I had to repay for the room, it took 12hours to get approved for a refund that will take 7-12 business days to get money back. Will not recommend this app to anyone | Worst app ever to book hotels. I booked the singing tree by nirvana in the goa, on the app it is showing that there is no need to pay advanced.. Payment will be done at hotel when i reach. But after twp days.. I got a mail from somewhere that i have to pay 30% now. So i thought it might be a scam.. So i called in the hotel but the receptionist told me that she will reply shortly. But got no call,after couple of hours i got a mail that booking havs cancelled..

However, this app still deserves 1 star due to the poor testing done and pushing out an app to production with such a serious problem that lasted for almost my entire trip! --- Previous review: The app messaging function is problematic. I had to uninstall the app in order to message the hotel. Please fix this. I've tried reinstalling the app multiple times but it doesn't fix the problem. | I need it off my phone but I'm unable to delete it | Easy | With better access to questions, now a great booking app. | Simple and easy to use.

Used to work totally fine, now I have to wait till I'm in a reception area to ring them to find out how to access the room/property. Also annoying that all kilometres are in miles instead.

None of them are perfect. So, I won't hold that against Booking. Some of the vendors were not doing good business. Booking provides the platform so I did not blame them. Booking has been easy to use and I trust the platform. Be wary of some vendors. That's what I will say. Keep traveling friends","This website will scam you. Purchased a package deal with flights, car rental and hotel. Flights were fine. Car rental charged us at pickup. Hotel had reservation booked under wrong first name and refused to let us have room.

This update contains some bug fixes and performance improvements to make your digital experience as smooth as possible. Bon voyage, traveler!","comments":["I have used Expedia for years. There has only been one situation with an independently owned hotel that was booked and,upon arrival, in complete shambles. Absolutely nothing as the photos or description. After reporting this to Expedia, telling them we had found another hotel and had booked it, we asked if there was anything at all we could be compensated for. They gave a full refund by the end of the business day. I will always book through Expedia. Feels good to know they have my back!","Every time I try to open the app, when I go to the Trips page, it doesn't show my trips and has a button to log in or create an account. When I go to the Account page, it shows me as logged in. On the Trips page I click the log in link and log in, even though I already am. So some pages show me as logged in and others do not. It used to work fine. I have the latest version. It seems to have started happening around the whole One Key feature. The app is pretty much unusable.","Sign in was a nightmare when I was trying to book a trip. I use this app all the time with no issue. Kept getting a message I needed to try again later. Since they now automatically send a code to sign in (I prefer my password), it automatically emailed me a new code 8 times while I was trying to get around the glitch. Ended up having to go on the website instead of using the app. Hope they have the sign in problem solved by Sat, as I have 3 bookings next week for a trip to Los Angeles.","I have had years of good service from Expedia, until my last booking. Their map listing of a hotel was 226 Dollars, and they upcharged me 140 Dollars for the rental. I called them back immediately to cancel the booking and they said they couldn't do it. Be very careful when booking through this site. Unseen charges could be coming. I would give the site zero stars is I could.","I like being able to book everything I need from my phone, and Expedia has always been my preferred method of booking rooms and cars, but the app has been such a hassle lately. Every time I sign in I am taken to a login page for the new One Key login. I try to login and it freezes up every time. It's so frustrating, and when I am finally able to login my reservations don't show up and I have to go back into my email to locate itinerary numbers."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.expedia.bookings","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.expedia.bookings&hl=en&gl=us"}

Often beat the competition. | Its been great !!!! Perfect way to reserve a place no hassles | The best hotel discount app ever! | Dope | If I could leave 0 stars I would. i booked a car rental the other day SPECIFICALLY asking for a car rental place AT the airport. The agent LIED and said the place was AT the airport when it was ACTUALLY thru TURO which is an app. I ended being booked thru a different app that is basically like airbnb but for a car with someones personal vehicle. TURO said they would fix and didnt, HOPPER is REFUSING to fix it and the last few agents I spoke with couldn't even understand basic questions. | Love this app It does all the work for you I don't need to be checking prices, Hopper does it for me | Cool and easy | Great easy fast experience | No real deals | Confiable y f√°cil uso | great | Grate app and accurate! Use it for all of my travel plans | Their phone line customer service isn't great, but CS did get a refund to me eventually after leaving a bad review. I want to like their service so much, because it is a good app intuitively. | Have not yet to get discount...but still looking | Amazing and very economic prices!! | I saved $100 on a Budget Rental car in Oregon. And then I booked a round trip, direct flight on Spirit from Ohare to Ft Meyers in early March for $148! Totally impressed and satisfied. | So far so good.

It's clean looking and user friendly. | Very useful app, love it | Was super easy to book my flight and access all my travel items and were clear on instructions about bags and tickets and delays and smooth and easy check in! | Great tool for arrange and budgeting any and all travelling needs. | Great deals and the search options are amazing | Nice App, it will allow you to hold until price gets better. | They charged me but never sent my money to the hotel. So I had to pay 112 first and an additional 210 when we got there because we didn't get the deal anymore. I contacted support, was told that they would look into it. I have been waiting weeks now. They won't let me call customer support for my trip anymore. (The \"get help\" button is greyed out so I can't click it. Which means I can't get an ID number to get a hold of customer service. So they took my money and then essentially blocked me. | it's a very easy app to use and I like the opportunity I have to check on the prices on airfare. | Very expensive air tickets in asia. Budget airlines seems to me really ripping off public and calling them budget airlines with the lowest fare! How is it possible that the budget airlines who even dont give free water are more expensive than national carriers???? It's like a joke with people when we find a national career is cheaper with 20+ KG baggage meals free. Everything is cheaper. These budget airlines are open scam. | They are professional | My own personal travel agent! Thanks, Hopper! | Give important notifications an no extra advertising. Love this | Always reasonable. | Amazing | Greattt Thanksss | I really haven't had time to set a time to get a hotel room because I've been so busy at work but I will tomorrow | It does no good to call. You guys have an automated answering service and the only way I can talk to anyone is if I let you guys rip me off even more and pay $16 for VIP service. I need my money back. The hotel did not honor the reservation so why am I not getting a refund? It shouldn't even be a question. They said they were full and had no vacancy. So, you guys should have given my money right back | I like the way it's service | This app makes flight booking so very easy. To me it has been tried and tested. | good one. | Every time I use a hopper, I get great prices, Great recommendations, and if I ever need anything.

Customer service was helpful, but English was not the first language of the person I spoke with! I user Hopper 3 times and will likely use them again! | good price | You all are very helpful | Best app I used so far. Still the best app and I like how they added prices for hotels and rentals. | Reliable good offering | Love the apps, especially the predictions on fares. Ofcourse, the prices are great too. | Great app for flights | Works well. Flight deal decent and never had a bad experience with customer service. I once booked a plane ticket to iceland the next day the flight was cheaper they worked with me to get the cheaper deal. | Best booking app | I used to Hopper a couple years ago and they are awesome everything was perfect. I will use them again and so should you... | great app | Good deals, I like to set up a trip and have hopper \"watch\".

I have used this app for all of them and have yet to have a problem. | They suck they lie about and they don't like to give your money back when asked for a refund they need to be reported to better business and shut down | Kept an eye on specific flights/ times & prices...just what I needed | Buenos precios | Love using this app!!! | Wizrow Factory üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ | Great app | Fantastic rates!!

I recommend it to everyone that likes to travel. Especially if you're flexible with dates & even locations; we were able to get round-trip flights to Australia for $400! I love that Hopper updates you of your price fluctuations; it makes it super easy to book. A couple of times we needed to change flights (once was international) & because we had the insurance, they were able to get us squared away with new flights & refunded for price changes. Love Hopper, best travel app IMHO","We've been using Hopper for years to find just the right time to book a trip and to lock in the rates we've gotten. We've traveled internationally and locally booking through Hopper and have never had any problems. Great customer service when we've had pre-trip questions, unlike what you'd get with G**gle. Love the alerts for best prices on watched trips as well, it's saved us hundreds of dollars!","If I could leave 0 stars I would. i booked a car rental the other day SPECIFICALLY asking for a car rental place AT the airport. The agent LIED and said the place was AT the airport when it was ACTUALLY thru TURO which is an app. I ended being booked thru a different app that is basically like airbnb but for a car with someones personal vehicle. TURO said they would fix and didnt, HOPPER is REFUSING to fix it and the last few agents I spoke with couldn't even understand basic questions.","I've been a long-time user of Hopper and appreciated its convenience for travel planning. However, I'm disappointed to see a shift towards misleading offers and claims that don't hold up at booking. Deals that seem promising initially turn out to be different, with hidden fees and conditions not clearly stated upfront. I did call the customer service right after learning about the additional fees, and since the customer service was not helpful at all, I wrote this review!","Terrible experience with the customer support team. I was told multiple times that a refund for my flight was requested and approved by the airline, to just wait, and now they say there is no refund, just credit. The person who helped me was so confusing, It was so hard to understand his english was very bad and gave me all the wrong information, saying I had credit with Hopper. I called the airline and confirmed that I had credit with them, and there was never a refund request."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.hopper.mountainview.play","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hopper.mountainview.play&hl=en&gl=us"}

We like having multiple users and the map option, which allows us to see how close all destinations are to each other. Today, I accidentally deleted our trip plan. I went to the help section and found that I could email support and they might be able to restore it. As it is Sunday, I didn't expect to hear from anyone, but got an email within hours from one of the app creators, and my trip was back! A++ service and app! | Terrible app. Tried to login on both web browser and mobile app and both FAILED. Website gave me an 503 error while loading the login screen, application doesnt even login. Ditch this app and choose another planner instead. | Just downloaded app to start planning after good reviews. Has uploaded hotel details from email forwarded but doesn't take flight details from same email. Won't let me tap on an airline or flight code when I try to input manually. Frustrated already! | This app makes it easier to plan and share live itinerary with family and friends. I use it to plan nearby activities which showed the distance which help to also plan our transport. And it syncs to Google Map so it is helpful to make last min changes and yet travel safely. Highly recommended travel planning app! | the best planner | great app for planning trips. I will use it for a long time. | This is a great travel planner app! Can't recommend it enough. | The versality of the app was fairly easy to maneuver. Activity suggestions were very helpful in planning the day events. | I'm enjoying all the tips on what to expect and where to visit. this app makes it easier to plan and you can get directions to each place within the app. very convenient . thank you! | I just got this app and I'm already frustrated. I can't add transport between places (like Uber from airport to hotel) I can't add an activity without adding a place but when you add a place it shows all sorts of other information I don't want to see. I don't want recommendations. I don't want pictures. I don't need the web description showing. When I'm done adding places to the itinerary, I want the \"add a place\" field to go away. It could be great but UI is not efficient or customizable | Can't even try without card first no thanks | I found this to be a very useful app for itinerary planning. One feature I would tweak is to have the ability to numerically place a new item into the itinerary rather than having it added to the end and then have to reorder it. Other than that minor issue, it is a great app! | I was able to plan and map out my entire trip. It was a great resource to have! | I am a frequent traveler and travel with big groups 2-3 times a year. This app is EVERYTHING! Makes planning so easy with other people as well. I love it üòÄ | lots of tools but still east to use. | Amazing app to plan any trip | Not what I was looking for. This app is too busy | I used the free version for my trip and would say that it reduced alot of unnecessary stress for me to navigate around. The best thing is that it shows the distance and travelling time making it easier to plan our routes without dropping pins on Google map. There's also recommendations of places to visit. Will continue to use this app for more upcoming trips. | wonderful app. it meets all my needs. | great app! | No description on how to use | very helpful app so far. its helped organize my trip, personal and business. good job! | I love how organised this app makes your trip! it keeps all together, from your flight dates and booking nos to where to go next with accommodation reservation nos and addresses. Well worth the money!! | fantastic | absolutely not worth the money. | update sugggestion : great app as always! can you add widget for quick add for expense and quick check in to the current location if possible? **************************** after so long i finally found an app that is how i would want it to be, tho alot of feature r still tba but the core feature are there, thank you for making this! | As a first time user of this app, I can honestly say, that it was super easy-to-use. I've already started spreading the word. It took me a bit to find this app, and so happy that I did. I used to use another app, that is no longer available, a few years back. It's especially helpful with the budgeting feature, when you are splitting costs with others, and knowing who owes $$ to who. I will be using the app for all my trips and will probably upgrade to the Pro version. | Best way to plan a self guided tour! My sister and I took a trip to Ireland, rented a car, and planned the whole adventure with this app. Great suggestions, loads of photos, map features, route optimizing. Excellent! | I'm really enjoying the visual organization offered, I have such a difficult time planning huge trips like this. thanks again because I'm enjoying the process this time. | Enjoyed this app, I was able to invite my travel friend to it and we could plan at the same time. The pre-populated packing lists gave helpful reminders! | Most efficient travel app. Worth the money | By far the best trip planner app I've come across. However, there might be a memory leak issue as the app gets slower and slower with more time spent on the itinerary. The app has been lagging a lot lately. Especially in the map mode. Been using this app for a year, still hasn't been fixed. | This is wonderful apps. It help to plan by yourself or collaborate with others. It also can book through hotel and entrance ticket from the apps. Is one stop solution for travellers... It also record our budget and expenses. It can share to people also. | awesome app. I love it. it connects to emails maps and many more. perfect. | Tried the trial pro version, it couldn't do the first most basic thing what I wanted (import an image of a map...!) - it suggested I save it to a cloud based storage then save the link to that in Wanderlog - seems counter intuitive to me. I have gone back to just using drive and saving all my info in a folder there. Wanderlog not so wonderful after all. | Nice try but WAY too cluttered and complicated, I might as well keep to my current workflow, Google Docs and Google Maps.... no time to spend learning such an information overload. | I loved using this app in planning a recent trip to Italy. I was easily able to import all my reservations and bookings, move itinerary items around, track expenses, and share my plans with co-travelers and family. I really loved the little tips and suggestions, and the option to have the app map my day for travel efficiency. I used to do all this on a spreadsheet and will be using wanderlog going forward | usefull | Great app to keep everything in one place and collaborate with trip-mates | Very helpful in planning our Tokyo trip. | love it!! | It's an excellent tool for travellers, even better from the ones who are not traveling alone. You can share everything with your travel partner (S) and plan together. I really love this app. | Perfect for planning an overseas trip with friends! I love that multiple travelers can collaborate and add to the trip planning. | helpful for our first trip!! the app isneasy to use and navigate | Everything in one app (car rentals, hotels, maps, even AI), you may like it or not. For me it's too difficult to digest (I tried a few times). But when I saw \"your trip is too long\" I finally gave up... | I took a family trip to Portugal, spending 3 days in Porto and 3 in Lisbon (actually here now). The Wanderlog app helped us map out and time our plan so we were able to maximize the sights we saw and work in stops for food and shopping. Highly recommend using this app for all vacations! | The app made traveling around Taipei via public transport a breeze. Won't hesitate to use it again on my next trip. Planning for the trip was also a fun and easy experience. Would not mind paying for per use instead of monthly subscription since I only travel 1-2 times a year. | Works exactly how you expect it to | Wanderlog helped the three of us collaboratively plan our trip and it kept track of our budgeting. It was a great resource to allow groups to track what they are doing each day of the trip. We used it constantly. | feel good to use. will be better if it is easier to edit. | I have planned many trips with Wanderlog. Love it :) | Great app. Easy to use, informative, is a great planner overly. the free version still has a ton of functions to make it perfectly usable. | Very useful app | AMAZING App. This organizes all your travel needs in 1 place, no more looking through multiple apps to find hotel info, flight info, notes. I have the free version and Love it! | I'm using the free version and love it! It's a really easy to use app. Very customisable for each trip with different folders, daily itinerary, and recommendation blogs. You can see all saved places on a map to allow for itinerary planning. Can't recommend enough. | Misleading cost of pro version - I was charged for a full year instead of the monthly cost shown. Not cool. I just wanted to try the pro version for a month before deciding wether or not this would be helpful for my trip. | I like how easy it is to use as it syncs the places I want to go directly into the app! :) hoping to have a timetable tab where I could see everything I've planned though. | This is a great way to sync up your travel party! | This app really makes it easy to plan out a trip, find options for activities or places to visit, select a restaurant, etc. And it's really amazing that the free version will allow you to email your hotel, car rental, and flight reservations to your trip and then automatically fill in the details. It's also nice to be able to share the trip plan with others (either trip mates, or just family and friends so that they know where you'll be). | Must pay | Amazing travel planning app. Super easy to navigate and collaborate with fellow travelers. Win-win for both type A and go with the flow travelers. Thanks! üôåüèΩ | Great for planning trips | Really easy to use, and has plenty ways and spaces to keep your itinerary organized! since there is so much information, the screen can be a bit cluttered at times. Still the best trip planning app I have used. | Do not sign up for free trial!! It's not free. They will charge you anyway! And Google play won't refund or intervene to force them to abide by the \"free\" trial. | Great app, I love the map feature in particular and how easily it can pull information about booking from emails. | Very helpful for getting around places you don't know if you're willing to put in the effort ahead of time. Used it for NYC and just checked what map pins I was close to for what I needed. Had a food list, a picture spot list, and so on. How the itenrary is set up needs a little work but it's still pretty good. | The best travel itenerary builder I've ever used, hands down | Amazing app!! We're using the free version so far, and we're very pleased! The map and the explorer sections are super helpful!! | great trip planning app!!! | There's way too much going on in this app. Tripit is much more user friendly and clean | The app is amazing and has a lot of options go plan your trip. The only that I have noticed so far is it is extremely slow when adding much locations, reservations, etc, even for the Galaxy S22+ which is a high end phone. I am willing to pay the pro version but I need an optimized app, otherwise it is not worth it. | How to search word within our plan/itinerary?? & Oso can pls at least tell yall will add this feature asap? & The driving time needed between places is totally inaccurate mostly. Very disappointed . | Absolutely Fanstastic! My wife and I planned an amazing 8 day trip thanks to this app. Consolidating all information in one place makes trip planning a breeze and saves a lot of hassle and frustration. | Great app for planning and using while on trips. 5 stars | Very easy to use and intuitive. I tested out 3 different apps before settling on this one. It goes beyond expectations and even gives helpful tips. (Turns out our trip falls on a local holiday!) | Really easy to use, a great way to collate the trip details | easy to streamline trips. I wish there was more color option or if we can choose colors because it tends to mesh in if youre in one area for multiple days as the colors look very similar | wanderlog is the best | Excellent free travel app, great for planning trips and sharing with fellow travellers. | So far it's super easy to navigate & put my entire itinerary in one spot. My biggest concern is if it's going to do what I want while I'm on the road to my destination. I want to make stops along the way, but am unsure how to even find places with this app that are along the way. | We don't want a free trial because ITS A SCAM. WE..... yes WE, should decide if we want to PAY after we try your app out. HAVING TO CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION ON OUR OWN IS SCAMMY. Your approach is dishonest and underhanded. Tripit got my $$$ because your process is greedy. Congrats. | Really appreciate the UI and the fact that I can still use the app functionality despite only utilizing the free version. Will definitely upgrade to Pro version when I am able. | I just want to find way home | Kalo mau traveling tertata dengan baik, wajib pake aplikasi ini. | I like the map that is beside the program and that it has numbers. You can create lists. I like that you can add the expenses at each place. It has suggestions. I like that you can keep notes. I like that everybody can see it and edit. I like that you can add your photos at each place. I like that you can add the distance from each place to the other. Overall, I like that it has all these in one place and it is a nice way to keep record of your trips. Every little detail is much appreciated! | Absolutely love this app! As a Type A planner myself, this is the best app to use when planning a vacation! | The best tool for trip planning. Not perfect but the managers are listening and improving constantly | almost perfect! but good enough to warrant 5 stars from me | Amazing, this is very helpful! | absolutely wonderful. love this app. genius idea. | Very useful for long road trips. Lots of great features in the free version. Would love to pay for the full version, but a pity that it has to be a full year commitment straight away. | so easy to use! | Edit: Places I've added have stopped disappearing for now. I'd still recommend not relying on this app alone to plan your itinerary. Definitely have a spreadsheet and/or Google maps as a backup. Original: A lot of the places I add keep disappearing. It's also not allowing me to access feedback/support. Other maps apps are more reliable. | Really useful. Would like some features like: Ferry tickets. Tour reservations, Icons for an emergency list: (Police, hospital, consulate) | Love it thus far! | Despite saying it is free the app tries straight away to charge. Immediately deleted it. | I really like this app as everything is in one place and easy to finf | Too expensive for what it does | When I was signing up I was offered the annual subscription for 49.99.... 15 mins later I'm liking what I see, and get hit with the \"20% off limited time special\" except the cost for the year is now 63.99...what?? Make it make sense. | super helpful | My favorite trip planning app! Aesthetic, intuitive and user friendly. Gets me pumped for my trips and keeps me organized! | A wonderful app that makes the trip planning a lot more easier. It's a pure joy who loves planning trip. | Fabulous well thought out app, planned and kept us on track when travelling to New York. Will definitely continue to use. | Amazing travel planner! I wish this app existed years ago üëè | I am loving this app! I am using it to plan my Tour of Italy trip, which prior to the app I had spent countless hours organizing! this app has been amazing! It even notified me that one of my lodgings had closed permanently! huge Saver! the app saved me a 3hr. drive and lots of aggravation! | Absolutely loved this travel app to prepare for my 7-day trip to Paris. I found it so helpful to plan each day intubation Itinerary and fit in all of things I wanted to do while optimizing our time. We were able to do most everything we planned and then some! Loved the AI feature and checklists, too! | it helped us pull together our travel plans, and gave us lots of travel flexibility. I don't know how we could have pulled together four different people's preferences into a cohesive plan | Able to back-dated trips is an excellent feature, now that I can keep records of my travels. TQ | It's a no brainer!! One place for everything. !From your flight plans, accommodation, places to see or eat. Create your own list and personalise your trip. I love the interactive map that gives you website details at your fingertips. Can't wait to see how well it works once I am on my getaway | Very helpful in planning out trips. | Good | Easy and fun to use. Map you itinerary beforehand and spend more time enjoying the sights. | This would be perfect if I had a way to do group texting with the people I'm sharing the itinerary with. | Going to make it so much easier when walking the Camino Frances | Extremely happy with this app. Super easy to use to plan activities but also get extra information on the fly about what we are visiting with the links to Google and TripAdvisor. Also gives an estimation of the transport time between 2 activities and you can vary the mode of transportation between during the day. Cannot recommend it enough for trip planners! | I told my daughter and my friends. | very helpful during the planning of my trip | Found the app really useful, helpful and would definitely use again. I would also recommend to others needing help to plan and structure their trips, especially for areas they are not overly familiar with, with regards to locations. | App is very laggy and has sync issues. | This is a great app, and I like being able to forward my reservation email to a unique address to import the details of the trip. Lots of helpful planning tools, etc. even with the free version. Using the free version allows you to get an understanding of the app without making a commitment. | I tried a few commonly suggested itinerary apps before landing on Wanderlog. They have just about every feature you could want; I often found myself hoping a feature existed before checking & it would turn out to be already implemented! Understandably, a few are locked behind a subscription. I'm considering upgrading to Pro to support the team, but it's hard to justify because I only take such trips once a year. If there were monthly subscriptions, I'd seriously consider it! You guys rock!! | Very helpful in organizing everything I needed for a trip in one location! | intuitive layout for quick on the fly trip planning. map and routes make it time saving | I love this app. use it to plan all my trips. | Love this app | Would totally recommend to anyone it is easy to use | Very good apps for travel planner. | Fantastic app, helped us put our plans in order, create packing lists with ai and push the directions to Google Maps on our phone while on the go. Recommend it to anyone who is the planner for family holidays - much better than the old excel sheet and printed out addresses! | Got me through my first family trip as the planner and I can tell my family enjoyed every stop I took them to. I didn't have anyone to coplan with, but I've seen the itineraries my friend has made with her coplanners and it sounds very easy according to her. The only annoying UX thing was how the rearrange menu would go to the beginning of the itinerary, even when I try to rearrange day plans for days after that. I hope this feature will be added in the future. | I have been using this to help me plan a trip to NZ, Fiji and SE Asia. I love that you can search for a location and there are recommended things to do there. This is much easier than generally searching the internet as you can then quickly add it to a list for the future! You can also add your bookings to this by simply forwarding an email, so simple! | awesome way to organize a roadtrip | maps r good for now. Interface is best | so far so good | It is constantly trying to get you to upgrade. To the point you can't use it. | Welp. I thought this would be cool But only 1 of the 5 Airbnb's I stayed at, were added to my trip. It says to email confirmation. It worked for one stop and that's it. If you can't add where I'm staying then everything else is pointless. You guys get that figured out, 3 stars. Also in Northern Cali, this app \"doesn't have full coverage of the surrounding area\". Have state parks and destinations you want to add to your trip? Too bad, not this app.After getting that notification..I uninstalled | I don't use the pro version. I've managed to plan and set an itinerary for my 3 week trip through Japan. very useful and easy to use. | The app is really nice, helps you get done a lot in terms of organising, is very well thought and the flows are intuitive. Also, performance wise is very nice. I really recommend it, it's one of the best if not the best. | used this for a trip to l.a, really helpful for keeping everything straight when it came to planning!!! | I rarely leave reviews, but so far, I'm very impressed. This is a really good app that consolidates all my travel reservations in one place. Airline, rental car, hotel, agenda, itinerary, activities, etc. It is so easy to import all of these loose ends by simply forwarding the confirmation emails to my profile. I did have to QC the details and make a correction, but it was all entered into my trip data, so even that was pretty simple. Great job with this. I plan to use it for all my trips. | Doesn't plot short trips or search by business names. Using it requires the person to search with awkwardly formal addresses that may or may not register. Probably good for city to city but not for around town trips. | Used Wanderlog for the first time while planning a trip with a friend to Mexico. It was great to have a place to share information during the planning stage, and we often referred to our Wanderlog during the trip. Used the app on both mobile and on a laptop. It was easy to seamlessly add all of our reservations in one place and build a collection of things to see and do and places to eat. Would definitely use Wanderlog again! | love the simplicity and the intricacy of the app | Absolutely love it. It's the best for planning. | No thanks. Glitchy amd popup heavy. Needy. | So far so good. What I love even on the free version is the ability to see all the POIs on one map. Then I can see where the logical place to stay... | I believe I enjoyed more of my last trip by using it, by optimizing time and not losing visits because of opening hours. Listing everything you want to do before or while going on a trip is really helpful. I was looking for just a \"map with a checklist\" then I found a better trip planner for myself :) | easy to use! loved it for my trip to Spain | Might have some uses, but just directed me to Google maps and kayak. I could do this myself. | keeps all your documents in the one place. love it | I found this app a couple month's ago and love it. I've been a planner for as long as I can remember. I have 5 trips I'm activity planning with this app. It's nice to have hotels, resturants, activities, and budgeting all in one app. It's very user friendly. Im definitly recommending it everyone in my trip parties and anyone who plans trips in general.","histogram":{"1":681,"2":235,"3":145,"4":532,"5":11499},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$1.99 - $79.99 per item","androidVersion":"8.0","androidVersionText":"8.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"Wanderlog","developerId":"Wanderlog","developerEmail":"support@wanderlog.com","developerWebsite":"https://wanderlog.com","privacyPolicy":"https://wanderlog.com/privacy","developerInternalID":"Wanderlog","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UPCPofy2GzRCOSvrJh1Vf03KJ-yoZlzPn9F8X3wmZ3Q8Ja2cFSgMVTW9RzISEKLJ9us","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zw-QaVlEkLAdX77kgmoIbIZJCrZO3AEuzG998pehnsGBLiwluHMaej5UEgyVnvRquP4","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s4ov2KdTRKPFNmW8uqzvS9aHB2hAg93KzUEL2rJ1blL1Sdgli6OzouOIn_0fH8N2yiw9","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hv0ww5ird-jcav8NYs9G4U7g9vfShOGH_V0qvplERqNIlapGqO2wvnMYtUf8Bl4Byg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SfJKx8Xp1VEHUxOkNDTFBsY7F1ROEsCJ5PM683e5NRdvaFWpKTxnhOTXQ9RTW2IgVPU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bHi0phpXB0Gv8S8dfDRPUJcAdj5yKa1Vr3m4Y3C2kIagGmKMydHiRBFHmXr2rNYOVS84","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mHJtRJgsG3ti-BJltQ2zoTOn0GUaRCC9bfYY4fCr8hfKShLH3VfE4QXy2F0465hubePU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0lybPwdP2xX6zvxFhgwJ-qq40Ycgpi0Yu5IIkQXijt0d0G91vizFsJAQgxRSzugXHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TCTXPzxqld4owbTWUDybBVUWSXmNmFmKOFViubFKC-Eo5I6u-8AzE40oXcsIHjO0LcI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FUqSOBXt2XMMt-DjCX-2Fw9JEiCiLDdd0Qe9kY4ljczevM01v5OrvsuFlr4Lg-uoOHBK"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Aug 21, 2019","updated":1710495087000,"version":"2.119","recentChanges":"Wanderlog got faster and cleaner!

User friendly. I would highly recommend this service as you can get what you want, at the price you can afford. Excellent app. | Always a pleasure to book an Airbnb. I genuinely prefer a creative, homey stay compared to a hotel. lovely experiences from \"ok\" stays to \"memorable\" ones. Airbnb keeps me on my toes looking to up the next experience in a new area, learning the culture and being a local! | Am in love | So easy to use and found a place right away! | Easy to book | Pretty easy to use and allows convenient search preferences like \"waterfront\". I wish it allowed you to change dates without going all the way back and starting the search over. If there's a way, it wasn't apparent. | Easy to navigate and plenty of different choices | Great service and great prices | They were great as usual! 5 star! | I ‚ù§Ô∏è airbnb, they are so much better than a hotel. | App is good but wish could put in price order when searching listings. Also the charges Airbnb add on nowadays for a week can be over ¬£100 which is ridiculous. | Host cancelled, Airbnb totally unhelpful. Will use a hotel next time. | 12 years of staying with Air BNB and still love it!! | Easy to navigate and book | Very easy! | I love airbnb never have had bad experience. Always read all the details, & reviews, rules etc | I can't believe this app got so famous. I could not make ANY reservation ever, because always 100% of the properties turn out to be already reserved. Then why are they listed as available for my dates? The hosts always replied \"sorry, we forgot to update our dates\". Airbnb, why do you allow such thing at all? Why should we lose whole day selecting properties and then contact everyone to check if it is available, just to find out it is not? Have you seen such thing on other platforms? | They have mafia making females come to hostel, not original bookings | Easy to use and very informative | Easy to use. Gives all information you need. Felt secure when paying. | Great app love it | La instalaci√≥n de la app fall√≥ y no pude usarla. Me envi√≥ diferentes c√≥digos de verificaci√≥n simult√°neamente y me bloque√≥ el acceso a mi cuenta. | Wonderful App | The best app ever! | Love it | Getting a bit pricey | Cannot Book. I have my phone number on file in the app, but when trying to book a room, it stated that I need to add a phone number before I can get confirmation. Well, I put my phone number in but then got an error: \"This phone is already in use.\" It won't allow me to book without having a new phone number for some reason!! Very annoying!! | The new design sucks. Where can I find the option to share easily my listing and the option to set the mininum days to stay? Why the photo tour? How can I go back the old design? | Love getting places thru Airbnb. | Useful for looking for an overnight stay | So easy to do | Paying for booking is an issue but it doesn't tell you what the issue is. | App works flawlessly | So far only had good experiences | App said I won't be charged but I was asked to pay | Excellent | This app has been a blast. I have met the coolest hosts all over the world. And the platform is super easy. | easy to use, book & pay for accommodation | Good essay ways to find out what you are looking till now we're happy | Nice way to book accomodation. Very irritating they push google and facebook linking all the time. Only use obsolete bankID for mobil or a uncommon password/SMS way for card verification. Can not use regular bankID for card verification. | Great app to fund accommodation | Great experience | üëçüëç | Easy to use and check all the details | Excellent | I have only used AirBnb once and the experience was great. So easy to use | This app makes it easy to make informed decisions about choosing where to stay. | Airbnbs used to be affordable and safe years ago...NOT ANY MORE!! AVOID!! I was shocked to discover Airbnb in bed with organised crime offering illegally unsafe accomodation with ritzy misleading ads!!...and...after several years of not using it...that it is now common on the site for a blow up mattress in a flood prone toilet next to a fire safety nightmare of a kitchen...to be $1000/wk+...it has become overblown with greedy organised criminal dreamers! | Pathetic app. My account has been suspended for no reason and i am not able to log in to my account. I have been hosting for more than a year. They say please log in to my the account to contact them while I am not able to login. | Fk this clown business operations that dun gaf about consumer protection. When host cancel booking in short notice Give U miser bnb voucher with short expiry when the offering easily 3 or 5x higher by then. Fk U bnb may Ur stock got short to dismal and Ur host got bedbug issue. | A great and easy to navigate application. Always gives clear views about the property and helps to choose the right one as per my preferences. Also clear about instructions set by the property owners and easy to communicate with them. | Good | WORST BOOKING APP EVER Horrible costumer support | My first experience... It's my initial booking... | Pay me extra for the 5 star service | Difficult | I have used airbnb for several years and I have never been disappointed. It is easy to use and you can't go wrong with the superhosts. | I love this app. It makes places to stay easy. I have learned to really read the posts to make sure we are renting what we want. | Easy for a first timer. Im so glad i decided to try it out. Ill not ever do a hotel again. | Easy to book. | Love it | Good choice | Easy to use. | Always easy to use! | I love Airbnb....easy, safe and quickly. | Support terrorism / Is not real | Good variety | The app is rejecting my payment options and pausedy money for over than a months. Air bnb are scammers | Great for finding excellent places to stay with exactly what you need and perfect locations | Nice app | Easy to navigate! Love it! | Recently a problem with dark/light theme in the app appears. Android 14. The optional theme on the phone is dark, as I understand the app tries to set itself, but it's really messed up (partly dark, the text impossible to read). To get the light theme I have to reset the phone; force stop is helpful smtimes. This is irritating a bit. Hope you'll fix it soon. Everything else is fine. I use Airbnb everytime I need to find a comfortable stay-in for a trip. | The integrity of the reviews of the stays in the app is questionable. Gave an honest review which host told me to remove as it will affect their ratings. Host wanted to give me incentive which I didn't accept. Next moment, Airbnb says to remove my review because it contains threat, manipulation and incentives. Of cos Airbnb says they have got highly confidential way of vetting the reviews and refused to advise why my review was removed. Proceeded to close my case without my consent. | Easy to use | Airbnb has driven the price of rentals in small towns like mine to rates comparable with San Francisco, & Redondo Beach. The difference from just a couple years ago is insane. Landlords, are publishing their rentals, and turning into Hosts, and renters are suffering in a huge way. | From across the States... to across the pond... every stay has been absolutely lovely! | easy to find what I want | Not enjoying taking multiple photos to verify who I am. For the app to work properly. | FIX THE PRICE FILTER. WHEN I SET IT TO MAXIMUM $60 PER NIGHT IT SHOULD NOT BE SHOWING ME ANYTHING MORE EXPENSIVE. IT IS SHOWING ME EVERYTHING AND I NEED TO SCROLL ENDLESSLY TO FIND WHAT THE FILTER IS SUPPOSED TO SEPARATE AUTOMATICALLY. using Google pixel 7a latest updates installed. | Great app & service for civilization! Definitely makes world a better place. | Love this app | User friendly app | Fast and great service | Very excellent | Terrible. I abandoned my fb account and am not permitted to use abnb without. Tough cheese abnb. I must go elsewhere. Uninstalled. | Very easy to navigate and well selection of products. | This is a very easy app to use for a first timer | Easy to work with | Very good app for a digital nomad. I only hope they add the filter for balcony. Now I always have to search the pictures and comments if it has a balcony | Easy and efficient | Awesome | Easy, smooth and very efficient | Verification process sucks. Other than that app seems effective. | Love the app, it makes every step of the process easier for Hosts and guests! | Real smooth bookings. | They make it feel like home | Best app ever | Very easy to book and quick | Great so far | I love using air BNB | Amazing time with the family! Love it here. | Love it!! | Cancellations galore ... HOWEVER I experienced excellent customer service. I have never experienced meditation before and am thankful to have had a positive experience with Airbnb support. | I found this app very user-friendly. The way the info about each listing answered most of my questions. | Maxamad ibraahim | Good app. Easy to navigate around | Update: The fees have killed Airbnb. Misleading prices. Now much more expensive than hotels. 4.5 stars is definitely fake, first 100+ relevant reviews average 1 star, that's what people really think about Airbnb now. Since IPO, experience is terrible, stock keeps declining as well, it's like they want to fail. Of 125k complaints on Twitter, 72% were related to customer service. Airbnb blocked a refund due to an investigation on the host, unrelated to me. End of the day Airbnb kept the money. | Excellent app! | Excellent app for booking. There are lots of improvements throughout the years. | Will let you know later... | Just love staying in Bnb,it gives you flexibility and comfort more than a hotel. | Only I gonna say I love üíñ this app!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | Very easy to use | Fantastic | Easy to use | The app is nice, but there should be a pay in 4 option. | Excellent | Pleasure to use | Very user friendly!!! | excellent experience | WONDERFUL | This app has gotten much worse. How can teenagers rent homes for parties now but I can rent a place for a trip with my family? Vrbo seems to focus on customer service. Use VRBO instead, much less stress and issues. | Excellent app and very easy booking site | Ahla | Excellent application. | I love that I can set my filters of what I want and what I'm looking for. Anywhere in the world, from Vegas to Iceland. | Easy and practical | Great | Easy | App has worked well for 5 years! :) | Very easy to use | Good host in Victoria, BC | I loved the AirBnb experience I've had with the person represented their home to me and my family and I hope people really try getting one for themselves. It's a really great experience and honestly will make you say forget hotels in my opinion. | Great app, and fast feedback from host | It is clumsy switching between \"hosting\" and \"travelling\" because they have different inboxes. I have never travelled with Airbnb only hosted. Yet Airbnb send my messages to \"travelling\". FFS The notifications do not happen even though they are requested in phone system | We paid 305.00 on an airbnb apparently it was double booked we were told it would take 15 buisness days for a refund and then asked to spend another 305 for a second booking totaling to 610 after already booking a separate stay of 285.00 totaling $895.00 all of this for a 3 day stay.. we contacted airbnb for help we were informed they are able to help \"47/7\" and told to wait 24-48hrs for a response from a supporvisor. Thank you airbnb for your lack of support, comprehension, and ruining our 2024 | It's a great tool for booking your home away from home. | Great:) | Easy and excited to travel. | I would give the app a five star but it doesn't let you filter out what size bed you want. They don't have a point system like Expedia after staying somewhere to use on your next stay. | Awesome!!! | Good app | Was so difficult with all the verification steps I don't think I will ever use this app again | Wouldn't let me pay easily | Somewhat better experience than with vbro. | Very good app with lots of information. | Much better than a hotel! Cheaper, too, and with more conveniences. | Great üëç | Great app, runs smoother compared to few years ago. Highly recommended, safe and easy to navigate, verified offers. Lovely overall experience. | Easy to use | Got stuck in a house with black mold... Our kids and our lungs were burning and we had to leave and get no refund. Horrible business. They don't have your back or your safety. | Facing issue with login. App is unable to send messages and call to authenticate the user. Tried uninstalling and installing the app. Issue still persists | Excellent aap | It was really easy using the app and it's very efficient. Crazy how travelling and visiting a different town isn't that hard anymore thanks to the app. | Good app | When you get this big and suddenly realise there's little in the way of actual service you can provide to customers, get bogged down by internal policies/procedures and there's a faint distant memory of what you started out to deliver in terms of a meaningful experience. | Easy helpful | ,E Sq33,$4$,,$$471543 | all good | Easy to find quality, nice cheaper place to stay for a whole family. Certain the locations are safe too and very near to every place to visit by walk and by travel‚úåÔ∏è Not a scamüëç | Well, after booking 8 months in advance, when the host cancelled your accommodation just 37 days before the trip, airbnb would not do anything to protect us. After long discussions on the phone they gave a 5% (60 eur) coupon. But of course the prices for the new booking were extremely high and not even the same nice place. This has happened to me two times when the prices go up so much due to demand in a place, the host cancels to rent their premises at a higher rate and you have to rebook. | why there's no \"NEAR ME\" option? I have no idea where I am in a new country I've just arrived, it would be much better to just automatically find me using my location and show where I can stay! every time I open this app, I wish I never did... | Very good, very clear and comfortable. | It won't accept my digital licence | We booked a few accommodations with Airbnb for us in Germany. | YOU can plan any kind of trip in any kind of dwelling anywhere in the world !! I truly love this app!! | Great options always available! | Easy to use except for some features like chatting with the i always can't seem to find it. | I love the app but hate the junk fees. | website is easy to use. information is up to date and accurate | Check-in details page is broken and does not open/ load correctly since updating. It's very, very annoying. | Very easy to look up and find places | Im new here. So far so good | Well, I am one of the most technologically challenged persons on this planet and I made my reservation without help! | Love it so far.... üòÅüòÅ | Sometimes great, sometimes not so | Great app. Easy to navigate, create wish list and look up places to stay. I always check this app when planning a trip now! | I used to love Airbnb. It has now turned into a complete scam filled with added fees the likes of which I've only seen at airlines. For a one night stay on a $155 off-grid cabin the size of a shed, at the time of booking it's suddenly +$50 for a cleaning fee, +32.70 airbnb fee - oh, and that hot tub and sauna shown as an amenity? That's +$50 to operate. Thanks for milking me like a cash cow. I just wanted to spend a peaceful night in the woods.. | More comfortable with other booking sites, vrbo does not ask for as much personal info to book | Great photos and descriptions and prices | Scam people out of money and don't give no refund back | Always a great time in great places with great hosts | The Airbnb app is so easy to use and always provides us with all the information we need to make our accommodation choices. | This was my first time using Airbnb and it was user friendly | Brilliant | A new way to holiday | First time so far so good fun | All aa | I have used different countries for many years, and it is always great. | Easy to use. | A very useful application! Easy to use. | Can't set my preferred currency.

However, finding those options is exceptionally difficult. The lack of useful search filters and inability to sort search results is incredibly frustrating. The categories are ridiculous and useless. With every update we lose more filters. It's as if the designers of this app go out of their way to make searching for listings as difficult as possible.","Recently a problem with dark/light theme in the app appears. Android 14. The optional theme on the phone is dark, as I understand the app tries to set itself, but it's really messed up (partly dark, the text impossible to read). To get the light theme I have to reset the phone; force stop is helpful smtimes. This is irritating a bit. Hope you'll fix it soon. Everything else is fine. I use Airbnb everytime I need to find a comfortable stay-in for a trip.","Have yet to have a smooth experience with AIRBNB. From their poorly designed \"category\" filter that doesn't have a show all option, to their ridiculous verification process which can also deny last minute reservations, I have yet to be satisfied with airbnb. I just made a reservation which did go a little smoother this time so far, but I don't have much faith this won't be headache free..","This app has gone downhill in the last few months. On the conversation screen, the keyboard overlaps the text box so you can't check what you're typing. Some text boxes don't auto capitalize text. I'm getting a pop-up to set up my home as a host. I don't own a home... Notification indicators also sometimes don't update in the app. Message notifications are not dismissed when a message is read inside the app. Definitely needs a strong bug fixing push.","App leaves a lot to be desired. Search filters are inadequate and also give false results. In the .messaging part of the app, the keyboard covers your typing so you can't see what you've written. Not unique to the app,but so many fake properties and bogus reviews.

The gameplay is simple but very entertaining quite addicting as well 10/10 do recommend | Interesting and fun. | It is super fun and relaxing. | The game is fun but after a certain level you'll need to spend money more than not to get through the daily challenges. What I find disrespectful is that they have an algorithm where if you spend money they increase the cost of everything until you go about a week without purchases, then they offer low prices. They need to offer better rewards for people that spend cash. There's also an issue where they seem to always give you more items that you never need. Not a coincidence, burns energy fast. | I can't open my game and it keeps linking me to my facebook instead. The loading screen stuck at 37%. Please help. | Amazing | Very addictive üíóüíó | I find this game entertaining. | V nice game | It's a nice gameüòâ | Its the sick game ever! Who ever made this game absolutely didn't want us to play because take hours to get energy and in a minute it ends! And also give us the most difficult daily challenges that you can never complete them It's not reasonable at all | It's fun and addictive, but now I play the game and it runs out of energy too quickly. | I'm new to this game but, I must admit it's addictive. Today's the first day I've played it. It's got the potential to be pricy if your impatient and don't exercise strategy's. I've managed to pass level 15 and finish all of the awarded daily challenges. It's nice that the energy level will replenish itself if you don't close the app and you give it some time. It's very challenging and the rewards for accomplishments are plentiful. Buy no gems. Focus on building and energy. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Iüíúthis game! | It's a relaxing game. | Fin an relaxing | Love the game but lives are too small should be 500 lives instead of 100. But love it. | Ia very good game | Very addictive! Love it! | So much fun of this game | Great game | Good game just wish I can get energy faster | El juego es entretenido pero cuando sale estos juegos.de 4 dias y cuando uno ya Casi VA a ganar ,no es posible pretenden a que uno gaste dinero para poder ganar si no no es posible | This game is fun to play, just that the energy really not enough, timing for energy to gain hope can be shorten for more satisfaction and the order not many as well. Sometimes will be difficult for non topup player. | Really getting into this one but took a while so many combinations to remember | Overall great game, but the daily rewarda are slightly too difficult, its almost impossible to complete the whole task without spending Gems, or using saved energy, and the rewarda are also not worth the investment. Been playing for 1 months and that is the main issue i got, but overall fun game. Lower the difficult on the daily task, and up the rewarda would be lovely. | Great | Great Game | Interesting game and easily addictive. But the time giving to merge some items are too much and some are scarce, especially when you need them. But it's an enjoyable game | It's fun and addicting to play. | In app purchases required. | Love it | I invited a friend to get a reward, and even though they got to level 6 and are new to the game, I did not receive anything ! Reddit had others with the same problems. Makes you lose confidence in the game, and more so... unwilling to spend money as it is untrustworthy. | Cant get passed l 1 | Having fun love merging! | Hate waiting for energy don't know how to get promo code | Addicting | Amazing | Very fun | It takes far too long to progress or complete tasks. Even after spending money. Makes a good game unbearable. It's as if the developers hate the gamers..... | Fun! | Travel Town started as a fun matching game, then became challenging, then a waste of time. Minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 6-10 matching items before it recharges again. Over time,more matching items are needed to complete your order. You end up more waiting than playing. Of course, you can use gems to speed process, but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Power maximum is 100 and disappears quickly. Get rid of recharging. Thx | Veryyy Fun game i love it sm | Really fun | It is a great game its fun but! 1th The energy is soooo frustrating it takes too long to fill and the daily tasks omg. 2th the board is too small when you have progress a lots of sticker come up and they made up so much room | I find it that if you buy the gems to get more energy then every time u need more energy the amount of gems go up, makes it very difficult to really get anywhere in this game, fun to play But stupid on energy and gems üíé just wants you to keep spending money which doesn't make this game to good | Fun üòÅ | That's a fun game and very challenging and I like that | Fun game | It's nice gamee | Fun liked the game | Nita rajput mast | Super addictive. Absolutely love this game. So much fun | Fun but not enough ways to earn energy | It fun to play be | Great | When board gets full I am stuck I can't delete anything nor can I play how do I fix it | I love this game but right now am loosing my mine if u can help right now I will be grateful. My game wasn't loading well so play. Mate asked me to uninstall and install again I did yesterday in the night. Boom am starting from fresh üò≠üò≠üò¢üò¢. I want my account back please . I am connected through Facebook. I am on level 60. Please can u resolve this before the challenge is over. | üëçüèª | No good | Just can't stop playing | Fun Fun,!! | Awesome! | Ok | I have started this game 4 times and every time I try to save to FB I lose the game and it starts over. What do you have to do to link it to a FB account????????? I would play it without FB but you have to link it to a FB account to trade the cards. REALLY FRUSTRATING | I really enjoyed this app I didn't expect it to be so much fun, but it turned out that I actually like this game. | Sweet | Super super entretenido | Awesome | Fun when you're bored if that ever happens!!!!! | It's fun | I don't like this new update. The game is very slow now. And now there's no exciting events in them . | So good and cool to play | Fun! | Edit: this game took 38% of my battery. It was fun first few minutes, later you realize daily challanges are impossible without paying a lot. As someone mentioned disconection between developer and customer base. Other merge games do it a lot better e.g. Megre Hotel, you should learn from them. | This is fun!!! | Visually pleasing and no game glitches. | Keeps you coming back for more kind of addictive | Love the game, amazing to play. | ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑŸá ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÑÿπÿ®Ÿá ŸÖŸà ÿ±ÿßÿ∂ŸäŸá ÿ™ŸÅÿ™ÿ≠ ÿ¥Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑ | I can not figure out how to pay the game. Can't get any directions. | Fun game. Ads are optional but useful. Good level progression. | Fun and entertaining! I'm new to merging games, and I really like this one. | So good | Fun, fun, fun and fun. You have to figure out the best part to what people want. It is difficult to do with the moves you have, but optional methods give more moves. I'm having a lot of fun playing this game. | Mera 1 week se game open hi nhi ho rha m khel nhi pa rhi | Enjoyed playing but now frozen cant play at all now nothing is working. Other games work so must be the game. | Stupid game really | The game of mine is frozen | Nice game | Good | Different and relaxing. I am enjoying it so far | Fun so far. | Enjoying playing this game for now | I gave it 2 stars just because the energy charging time! I lost my passion to play because of the waiting time ....... üëµüèºüë¥üèª | Great | I like this game but diamonds are expensive, and more than a minute before they give one free diamond so basically this game wasting time. | I play this game daily but for maybe 10 mins at most at a time. Very little options for getting more energy besides watching a few ads. I hardly earn diamonds to buy more energy, so it's almost impossible to complete orders in less than few days real time. | So far it's a nice game to relax | Made my day, but the energy get exhausted quickly. This game keep you glued | Used to like this game how it didn't give like any energy packs without Spending actually money . | Game has stopped working, will not load. Contacted the game support by email and absolutely NOTHING has been done, not even a reply so don't wate your time with this pointless game!!! | Got hung up on the first few plays. Frustrating. | Great | It was fun at first. Then I couldn't get to move any items without a purchase. | Unfortunately, it's not like the ad. It's too busy looking, too many things on screen when filling orders for different item types. I have no clue why the interactive part is even there as it's basically talking to itself. You don't talk to others. Worst of all is the limited time b4 you must stop. Every few minutes energy runs out and you can't play. Really dumb. Not relaxing. The ad is false, but fun! I can play while I am getting points for other games. Uninstalling. | very interesting game but loving it | Travel üß≥ Town - Merge Adventure RPG üì± Mobile app I discovered through Fetch a fun matching game that I can do quickly without thinking and isn't stressful. üëç Xox | Real cool game, awesome üòéüòéüòé!!! | Not worth the effort. Useless and tiresome. Very repetitive. Exhausting. And stupid to boot. | It's a fab game, I like the lack of pop up adverts. It would be better if the energy regained slightly faster. But overall it's brilliant and I waste plenty of time playing. | My game just restarted all of the suddenly I list everything I built for two years my heart is broken I don't know how to have my game back I lost all my data | Just downloaded the app two days ago and it keep glitching and kicking me out | Fun game | Very difficult to used actual rating is a negative 7stars.takes 5minutes to open, another 5 to actually play.not really worth the time and effort to download the game.. you deliberately made this game very difficult just to confuse people.. | Why do the slots have to be so much cost Can't even get any a lot and how can expand? My game is full I can't play | This game is so egregiously pay to pay. It leads you on by making tasks *almost* completable, only to cause you to lose out at the last moment unless you spend money. I never spent a dime and never would. Disappointing, frustrating, greedy execution, of a fun alchemy-type game concept. | Boring. | Good fun playing this game | Excellent | I really like this game! It's a ton of fun but like all the others, it gets harder and harder til it's impossible to play without spending big $$. I made it to level 39 spending a little, but now it's 17500 coins to buy a property. You guys don't have to increase everything this much to keep the game fun and entertaining. This just makes people stop playing. I'm sure there'll be an auto reply only to this. | Great game | Compulsive play. | Used to love this game and it became quite addictive. However as your level increases its becoming harder to progress through the game. At level 81 it takes so long to complete orders as your energy drains really quick, it's not fun to play anymore | Invited friend, friend downloaded the game through the referral link. Lvled upto lvl 7. But I did not receive my so called 200 energy. Feels like a scam. Edit: I've contacted your support, I still did not get my 200energy or any response from your support... | Luv it! | I love this game | i like the lack of ads | Love the game but downside you have to have Facebook to trade. Not a fan of Facebook linked games since not everyone uses Facebook (shock). Also wish the 24 hour event/tasks were alonger. Since very rare to be able to complete them with the time-limit. | Fun but challenging | I can't stop playing. Love it! | I really like playing this game even though I'm at the point that orders are really difficult to achieve. I think there should be a discard order option with maybe a wait time for next order. I think having easier orders to break up the hard ones would be helpful. Also, a daily log in would be good. | always kicking me out and restarting | Awesome üòé | Fun......Fun.....Fun..üòâ | It's a little of fun, but it takes too long to gather what you need. | It calms my brain down. | Fun, kind of addictive | Love it Fun game | would be a good game if it didn't crash litteraly every 3 seconds. its crashed 10 times in 12 minutes and I can never even play before it crashes again .. PLEASE FIX !!!!! | It's a fun relaxing game. | The game is designed to fairly consistently come to a stop unless you want to throw money at it to keep playing. | Great Game. | This app is good because I'm gonna get free robuxsü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë | Enjoyable | Super | It's pretty redundant | I love this game but can you please make it so you can get 1 energy per minute please | It's ok","histogram":{"1":6918,"2":4315,"3":5260,"4":10527,"5":114813},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $99.99 per item","androidVersion":"5.1","androidVersionText":"5.1","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"Magmatic Games LTD","developerId":"4765571944833116862","developerEmail":"support@traveltowngame.com","developerWebsite":"https://support.traveltowngame.com","developerAddress":"207 Regent Street,\nLondon, W1B 3HH\nUnited Kingdom","privacyPolicy":"https://static.moonactive.net/legal/privacy.html","developerInternalID":"4765571944833116862","genre":"Puzzle","genreId":"GAME_PUZZLE","categories":[{"name":"Puzzle","id":"GAME_PUZZLE"},{"name":"Merge","id":null},{"name":"Casual","id":"GAME_CASUAL"},{"name":"Single player","id":null},{"name":"Stylized","id":null}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JUd09-Jkgctks6QibZBPeqnpPA-6A6nMXZqAW9Fa0MKOsolbvGKSXEnuq9nxiKNCFVOT","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mlkWl1XfPqCkB89nAaWepmSc3SzGiXbA26vZ5cBGG3OzU-75-QuqsoyE3kc9Y0LcduM","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FPRZAGUkuNyT9DRbryWZvw2uc0gasQfdzL1HQM6tW-TzhbKBVB1f3K00Z9M_t5wBDcRx","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TLRepejlQtlV9vWthK_2_OZaUGHTmFcZDBszd8nkcc4mFpan0Fwjq8E7KucYZ6cnj7Y","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Jyy4yYQ6CBCot-V7e1AVhXXuL30_Bk_kCR4nm4wfRBTJVPRxmCVxIWxtZ3VuHy9XReXw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JVpKamlb1yxxsj_-Pn9Jgxtcd6TudOpwms_sqFJxAmcSSraoAmynj5xmRwgBDE-BCKA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R5KZHyV-S-5tmxHRDvEsta_7ntzndRm74jkz_zlKhSI74XSZj3EeEThhi3hCZ8YXTAI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5CniZewOHRklsi7qvuwrTV3wHI7yejXQ3ZI-wWiuofIlN9_QLYejBhrHWFOa2cM_b4s","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jt6mNg4AiiVBDrdzUV0F01EF1j1gK-dtYqHLjszJaVsPETlE6JbJ7YNbtpku4iHB-wg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-Ld6BXuvma4VZOJJrEQGuz9_evz34pVPWhzCsHqqR-JrHzT266sIxpVDn8Xh8GZBvPE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wT4UdiIwwlxu828BFgL8jsKk8Bo9YsiRyGnWMawuZfMMfWqdA2whhltIkqlesf3JYA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RLzWKeqOiWtm26Mh9ScN3Gq4Siou6-BfzY4N7Sv05SSSppJtmdAazBF5jKFNgRHhbw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mZuaViIpByBbwKIdfqbdYfoN3j0S6Aro_UcdqfBCY2k3rstjyfwTHn-feH5Q_LHIl_g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/m14oacQ9w3xJLLO8wd_mHHQwwzA8vliAyKx5_MwK5KffjHJyd7-1LmXy2nFxbHo7AhE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RO-ymWZAJc9ai4pvJlxRYaeIDAkDCelsuPRAG-2PNH_F7pkzwio-EKzV00xkkbNhuAM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GYYSzngT2-kXsMvzHbcXbbcrzDRIvRM_JIOtNft5tmTEx8offl0Y-SbWl2H3OTGjKCA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0SalDaqGkWVsv122t0bwWt7BCQ1kja3namp2ozMyWrb4Km-OmRRvZimRhAYFDZQHVojL","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2zVfsWetEMTfYtYvXI2C1J8xrMDV9HZ3XMQ23Ii-QHllm3wSKDIOK0Lv62dDNlnauNE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BCkt-bsi-DV0BqVWoaNxbbrvTbZEA9fFpB1qyg_0njcYGqpzeEEhRkTBq8QsMFpi0Mc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JXdXglFqfxJXw8BAdcLkMUyDeBitrIX7Ep2c95Uu3IZ8u30CURVcnil1_prAj5YSENZ6","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uTu5pgJ7x1GsoNYp4FWLv9Rr5eGGsqecgeTvPEPLiuuGa4tH8YZa5_bTwVwX4Wfx9qE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/suuyedaW5ded_HYHITsGECtmFgEs517yZ4_hdu4ZgJsCmx-SWwf6IyC5ASLIgk7E_A"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvIifkz2mbo?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mlkWl1XfPqCkB89nAaWepmSc3SzGiXbA26vZ5cBGG3OzU-75-QuqsoyE3kc9Y0LcduM","previewVideo":"https://play-games.googleusercontent.com/vp/mp4/1280x720/yvIifkz2mbo.mp4","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 21, 2022","updated":1710517676000,"version":"2.12.510","recentChanges":"Welcome to the latest update of Travel Town!<br>We‚Äôve been busy improving the game and addressing bugs for you. <br>Enjoy!","comments":["It's a fun game on the surface, but is the least giving when it comes to energy of any merge game I've played. Daily tasks are borderline extremely difficult if you're not setting timers for when your energy recharges or something. I'm lucky to complete one big item in a full day. It's an issue many merge games have and a few things have been added to combat that grind, but not nearly enough. It was fun for a few weeks or so.","Travel Town started as a fun matching game, then became challenging, then a waste of time. Minutes are wasted waiting for items to recharge. It then gives you 6-10 matching items before it recharges again. Over time,more matching items are needed to complete your order. You end up more waiting than playing. Of course, you can use gems to speed process, but you'll be out of them quickly. Then it becomes a paying game. $$$ Power maximum is 100 and disappears quickly. Get rid of recharging. Thx","Travel Town is an enjoyable and challenging merge game. It is possible to play for free with zero ads if you choose. To reach higher levels spending reasonable amounts of money becomes necessary. As mentioned in numerous other reviews, daily tasks are very difficult to complete, but can be accomplished by: 1. Playing every few hours for 5 minutes at a time using your free, rechargable energy. 2. Pay for energy, diamonds and or items. I find the items fairly priced. Thank you for a fun game!","I love this game alot. I have reached high enough levels that it takes an extreme amount of energy to complete orders. I have also noticed with probulay 100 dollars worth of purchases to get to 60 like I am. The 2.99 purchase gets most then its like oh 4.99 or 5.99 ain't bad. But after all I have spent in the last 3 days the lowest costing energy is 7.99 and up. I would give 5 stars on this game because I am so addicted to it. But at this cost will have to delete it before my husband disown me.","I LOVE this game it's so addicting. The only issue I have is with the energy, I wish I could keep watching Ads in exchange for 25 energy but there's a limit in the amount of ads you can watch before you get prompted to buy gem packs. I find it annoying that after paying for the gem packs and using it on energy that the amount of gems you have to pay increases each time and the amount of energy stays the same."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"io.randomco.travel","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.randomco.travel&hl=en&gl=us"}

I picked a City and hotel. They asked if I wanted a room for cheaper. I didn't care whether I had 2 queens or a king so I agreed. I get to the hotel to find that cheaper room was in a hotel 90 miles away. It took over an hour and chat while they asked me the same ?s over (what's your name. what's your name) because customer service was chatting several people at once. Then they said I should've noticed they switched the City. Sorry I thought your company was honest? | idk lowkey sketch? symbols in letters | I started using priceline to book regular stay-cations at local resorts, and I use it to get the best airfare for last-minutes or planned vacations. great value and I love the VIP hotel rates! | Will not login | The app was glitchy and wouldn't confirm my bookings repeatedly for last minute stays. Wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what happened and eventually realized the website worked while the app did not. Will not be using the app again, appears to suffer from bugs which don't affect the website. Customer service was useless in helping explain why the app wouldn't let me book. | Very good | The app keeps going through info already input and keeps cycling. | deals on any better than if I walk into a motel and run it from them prices are the same there's no discounts on here | ive used this app before, and loved it.. but now it wont let me search for a hotel.. I am about to delete and use another app. | Wonderful | I was disappointed that I was under the impression I had booked my room closer to my event which was on Garmacy Street in the Easton area. Arrived for check in waited for 20 minutes or longer to be informed I was at the Hilton Garden Inn located on Morse & Sunbury ~ no where near my event & nor did I even know this hotel existed ~ so before booking be sure to check your location 3600 ~verses ~ 3900.........and my oh my what a complete difference............üò™ | always helps me in very quick efficient manner. prices are always a little discounted. | fantastic deals | great | Always provide great prices! | older but kept up hotel parking lot shared with restaurant next door. office only open from 3-9 pm so you have to call them before 9, so they can arrange a key pickup for you. | awesome deals when you become a loyal customer. | great | Easy To Use and Quick Response | great prices !!!!!!!!!! | it's not automatically linking to account and bookings | great and easy | so upset can not modify dates and can't call priceline because they have a 3rd party phone service.... update::: It stated to cancel the reservation, then rebook to change dates and priceline charges 100. I called to speak to a manager, and he stated he could refund my 100 cancelation fee, but he wasnt going to unless I sent a screenshot of their site stating that!!!! PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE THEY CHANGE FEES JUST TO ADD A DAY OR 2 TO YOUR TRIP | Very helpful | Love, love, love. | I love the cheap prices!!! | Best price I found for my trip thank you! | awesome | Great rates and very efficient | thank you, WWJD? | Always a good option!! | Priceline rules! | planning was easy and the deals are really good...recommend VIP membership | Very excellent | yup | nice | want let me create an account. first time using priceline and it's been a nightmare. spending hundreds of dollars has never been so nerve racking. hotels shouldn't be this hard to book | Always Best prices! | you are the best to use for travel me andy family always use | horrid website. it freezes constantly and won't continue | Spams you with endless notifications that can't be turned off with deleting the app. They also farm out all your data. AVOID!! | Love the deals I get. | Smooth and error free process | sweet | when needing to cancel a trip due to unforeseen circumstances priceline was very helpful | Great app | Always finds me a deal! | great to have | Great Rates!! | Awful support. Contacted them many times and didn't want to solve issues that they caused. Yes. Rooms show different bed sizes on your app and hotels don't have those. Update: I reached out many times and didn't receive a response. it's been 5 weeks. | Changes booking to a different company without customers knowledge and at higher prices. Does not give money back. When you try to get bonus discounts they play it off as it's only for hotels with airfare and car rental. But that is never stated until discount is tried. Prices are decent but if company hides things from customers not very honest. | very poor connection | easiest, fastest, cheapest way to book and travel. Need some kind of reward system like the tenth trip is free or something | loving all the attention | Priceline makes online booking easy. you can make hotel reservations, airline reservations and car reservations. It's s so important to have something like this. | love coming to gateway Lodge Peter and his crew are the nicest people. Rooms are clean and comfortable.Alote of nice work outside too. When we come to Seaside always stay here | smooth app, good interface | easy online process .. good deal | I really enjoy using Priceline!!! | Priceline has been great for me for years now | Best prices always ‚úàÔ∏è | This is my first time being able to go on vacation. I have paid Priceline so much money in the past booking rooms and flights. But this time they have caused me to lose over a grand. They refuse to help me or get me help. All u people reading this don't use Priceline there is always a catch it's never what they say. Your paying them for absolutely nothing. | fast easy cheap! | I recently had a very positive experience with Priceline, and it was my first time using the website. I had heard that their prices were unbeatable, which made me hesitant to try it at first. However, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. Priceline offered me some incredible deals that no other website could beat. From now on, it will be my go-to website for booking travel accommodations. | awesome | easy to work with | My mom and I travel a lot for Dr. appointment. I use PriceLine a lot and I have saved a ton of money | Easy to use. Great deals. | simply the best | a quick and hassle free tool to search for good deals on your upcoming trip... | First time using this car rental service. | Priceline customers seem to be treated like trash lately. my latest stay room didn't have wifi and they refused to give me another room because that would have been an upgrade. | Great Discounts. | hey now | love priceline | my wife and I booked a hotel and got it the same night for less than $100! it is a great room as well! | Awesome app always gives me the best prices and the best hotels around | would not let me book or reserve anything for today | Very good üëç | Definitely save money going through Price Line | awesome | Always wonderful | cheapest and easy to book | great app and saved me over $150.00 | very good | problems loading | always get a deal | Quick and easy, and save money | love this site for last minute specials! :) | Need to check for app updates. no notice provided for updating the app. | üëç | always helpful | this is the best way to go | always a good discount comparatively | Best experience! | good üëçüèª | the map option doesn't have the prices and it's not as smooth as the online site... | Great lower price. Very well describe. | always get me the right price and get the flight and hotels I need | when I tried to book the hotel, money deducted from my account but priceline app is showing error | Motel canceled my reservation because of NON LOCAL POLICY. Priceline would not help or refund my money. | very user-friendly | They get me good prices on hotel stays. Every little bit helps. | The app appears to be crafted by amateurs, and I don't feel secure using this kind app. | A Great App For Trips | always Priceline | The door did not lock. very unsafe | love how easy it is to book through Priceline and I always feel like I get the best price!! | Always pleased with reservations. I've never used it for rental car or airfare, but I always use it for hotels | Doesn't work | amazing | Easy peasy... | great customer service, never was not satisfied while using Priceline | Great travel app | great app for low prices | Happy. | the best. | Don't back out of the app because the price will increase!!!! | Always use Priceline for hotel stays and has the best deals! | Booked a room for 2 days as a gold member and come to find out the hotel was doing some kind of maintenance and we had no WATER for 2 days at the hotel from 9am til 6pm. CRAZY! I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER | great rate and service. | easy peasy | great app, great prices. | awesome | definitely would recommend | I don't like using apps | I love this app I always get great deals !!! | Great site for the best prices. | cool | great | Priceline used to be good but now it's nothing but bait and switch. They'll show big discounts that disappear when you click on them. \"This deal is no longer available.\" Yeah, so stop showing me hotels and prices that don't exist. Priceline support tells me It's not bookable either. Specifically the Strat in Vegas. P. S. I'm VIP Platinum. | great deals | couldn't get a car in London KY pray they have one for me in Omaha,NE | flexible flights and love the apps | y'all are awesome thanks for the service | Book through price line they are excellent | our room was canceled by hotel and we were nit notified by oriceline | awesomeness | love the discounts, from being a vip member | I do all my travel reservations on Priceline. Great Service | best app ever come across | fast | I falling in love all over again spiritually and emotionally | quick and easy | can't get reciepts | won't work | they do a great job | Awesome | I asked my husband which car he wanted, the $685 or the $795? when I went back to the app page, literally 2 mins, the $685 was $1062. I deleted the app. | good experiences so far | easy-to-use software | best booking app | I have always had great luck with Priceline | You can book cars flights & hotels as a package deal | Priceline is quick and easy. Some of the best prices especially when you need a room at that exact moment..Thanks | I've used Priceline for years. I used to get decent prices, but get better pricing directly with hotel now. I'm about to give up on Priceline..also, one hotel didn't honor my reservation. I had booked 4 rooms at Holiday Inn, double beds, and they have me king beds..we had to get another room. Neither hotel nor Priceline would do anything. | nice | nice prices | awesome deals | I still don't know what the problem is or I'd say why this experience has been a nightmare resulting in an invalid confirmation number... so no record of a booked a flight... but money missing with no explanation where it went, not even the credit card company can figure it out, therefore i cannot book another flight until somebody somewhere figures out where my money went so I can get it back! | great stay | always a great Deal | Easy to use and got a great deal üëå | great | nice and helpful | When I type in the city or the name of the airport it tells me please try to search again we can't find the name of that City or Airport how hard is to find the name of a city called Chicago or Cedar Rapids | UNBELIEVABLE THAT A WELL KNOWN BUSINESS LIKE THIS CAN CHARGE YOU FOR A RESERVATUIN WHILE YOURE IN A CITY YOURE NOT FROM FOR A HOTEL THAT WAS BOOKED SOLID! AND THEY CHARGED FOR IT!!! THEN THE GAME OF EACH AGENT YOU GET TRANFERED TO WANTS TO RECONFIRM WIHT THE HOTEL WHAT THEIR CO WORKER HAS ALREADY DONE AND ITS MIDNIGT AND YOU JUST WANT TO LAY DOWN AFTER A LONG DAY. 5 days later and still no resolution. But they have stolen from me. Beware. | great app. thankyou. highly appreciated | I booked a flight and canceled it later due to a change of plans. I qualify for a refund. 4 months on still waiting. I have called about it many times. The last time I spoke with them, they said they are sending me documents to show to my bank that the money has been refunded as the bank requested for an arn to check on what was really wrong. They sent me a screenshot of my own booking and ended the call. I felt insulted and disrespected. I will never recommend them. | Not enough filters. Can't even search for a hotel room with 2 beds or indoor pool. App isn't user friendly and slow. The worst app I've used so far. | awesome | they have been very kind The customer service is on point | I'm VIP and they treat me like it. ‚ù§Ô∏è | Great App, super easy to select and pay for a hotel. | Love the great deals! | very good | Good | MY FAVORITE | easy to move through the system | I think this app is sweet | great | Kind of expensive. The site is easy to use but they don't allow coupon codes | I LOVE THIS SITE...GREAT DEALS!! | Outstanding!$! | Great service!! | Really easy to use and best prices for hotels, flights and car rentals | I've been using Priceline for years, I love you guys!!!!!! | couldn't make it without you | stayed at Wydham French Quarter New Orleans, bed would not stay on frame so felt like I was falling off bed, also no fridge mircowave, ladder in pool was not very steady. staff friendly, clean, good security. | Great deals!! Easy app! | the total price should be included from the beginning you shouldn't see reserve a room for $66 and when you click on it it says 81 after taxes and fees | I have been using Priceline for about 10 years and they will not update my email address.

And as far as the APP vs the website goes...room pictures never work on the APP. I have to go to the website to view pics of the room I want. The app doesn't come with any extra discounts. Skip it. Delete it. Don't need it.","I am a Priceline VIP, use the service almost exclusively, but the service has degraded significantly in the last year, starting in 2023. The primary issue is Priceline now often sells sold out hotels and rental car reservations. This wasn't the case previously. You'll show up at the hotel or the rental car counter and your purchase won't be honored. After you reservation fails, you'll have to jump through multiple hoops to get a refund of you paid in advance. Avoid for last minute bookings.","The app works well, but the discounts suck. Also, they only give discounts while you're already vacationing, and by the time you're off vacation the discounts are no longer valid. I have a gold membership, but the benefits aren't worth the prices you pay for hotels. Their service fees while booking are also very high, so by the time you get a little hotel discount the service fee brings the price right back to the original hotel charge.","I am IMMEDIATELY leaving a negative review. I booked a trip on the web browser. When I click print a pop-up about the app appears and will not go away. As soon as you book and it knows it, the web page becomes useless. So you are forced to get the app. Which I will promptly delete and never use Priceline after this trip is done. Back to Booking or Travelocity EDIT: IT GETS WORSE! download app. Create account. Finally get my trip added. Click details and this damn app just loads chrome !!!","I'll never use again. Booked a stay. And upon booking the travel 10 mins later decided to add days to my trip. The customer service on chat did not allow me to add time to my trip. I asked if I could cancel and re book with the extra days. They said no and I'd have to call the hotel to ask. They hotel says they do not deal with any third party reservations and are no help. I booked it 10 mins ago and was told any changes were to results in \"no show\" fees of the entire cost of the booking."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.priceline.android.negotiator","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.priceline.android.negotiator&hl=en&gl=us"}

Despite paying extra for an additional bed online, upon arrival, the hotel failed to provide it, citing staff shortages. After numerous attempts to reach out to Agoda via email, there was no response or resolution. To make matters worse, they only managed to provide the extra bed for one night out of the two booked. This level of service is unacceptable, and I strongly ad | Good | user friendly | you get what you pay for | Fake App Not booking hotel Room Full Payment complete and full Processing. Hotel Not accept this App. My loss ‚Çπ3000 Plz not us this app. üò•üò•üò•üò≠üò≠üò≠üôèüôèüôèüôè | very good | good | Ok | App very lag in login and open message | nice üëç app for room booking | clear, fast, informative and fast response from app | Good service | Great | Everything else is fine but calls are not received on the customer care number, if there are any issues then who will solve them? | cancelled my booking without a valid reason and then claimed they couldnt re-book | Scam. Do not use this app. Charged me for a booking I didnt make. Cancelled booking with no refund. For a booking they couldnt provide the booking for & neither could the property for them booking the wrong date not the date I entered. Arrived at the property to meet my booking for the day they could not provide accomodation for & claimed its the responsibility of Agoda! They voilated the cancellation policy. | Horrible experience! First of all the property I booked didn't have any phone numbers where I could call and they don't respond on mail or message. Failing to do that I tried contacting agoda Customer support, which is equally useless. They have a dumb chat bot for Customer care. So I'm writing this review now as I'm waiting here in the property, waiting for someone from the management/agoda to call me and tell me my room details as this was the only place I'd booked. Never trust this app. | Nice one.. | best price always | This app doesn't deserve a single star. The prices shown on the app while booking suddenly bumps when doing final payment in name of fees and taxes. Customer service doesn't give you breakup of these taxes and fees charged. Hotels booked from this app doesn't give their invoice . Now I m completely stuck and have to take huge loss because of this nuicense... Won't be ever using this app again for booking anything. Mail sent to your google support as well . Problem not resolved. | ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏° | senang cepat lagi murah | Agoda cheats its customers by giving them false belief that they are genuine and offer best price. I was fooled by them as they said the price they offer is lowest for a hotel booking, when I booked and found a better price at Make My Trip I was told that in your booking we are giving parking facility. So don't book with them guys. They are not genuine. | not user friendly | Hi. I'm unable to access to my save card. It keeps saying that they are unable to service my request. Please do look into this matter. Thanks. Hope to hear from you soon. P.S : please don't tell me to drop an email. I'll probably say the same thing. | The March Hotel page on Agoda says they have a restaurant, a breakfast buffet and breakfast continental. When I checked in March 14 2024, the front desk receptionist informed me they do not serve food, and that their restaurant has been closed permanently for a few years, and there's no buffet. I booked assuming there was going to be a restaurant on site, and I'd be able to grab a meal, but none of this was offered. I want a refund, doesn't have to be full, at least partial. False advertising | best | good | love this app | super easy-cheap and fast booking. set up my way | easy to book accomodations and provides rewards and discounts regularly. | It's not friendly user anymore. The cancellation process a bit confusing. They gave time for customer to cancel the booking but when it's comes to refund they ask to refer property, when we call property they ask to refer agoda. | Walked into hotel where there were ten other agoda customers who all paid for a reservation. Agoda kept sending the hotel bad credit card numbers that got declined. Every customer to include me had to demand a full refund. The hotel would match the price of the room but the refund wouldn't arrive for 13-45 days. Do not use this is a scam app that has other issues according to the reviews | quick and fast | Good | Quick and easy booking | Thanks your the discount. | Nice and easy to use | Once you have use their service , they just keep on spamming emails every day , annoying . There are owners who don't pick up calls and dont reply message, agoda customer service does not help much even at the day of check in. Not recommended , doesn't protect users from securing the room after paid. | Don't go to Chennai gate hotel experience was very horrible. receptionist fellow was rude . | ok | Good price, but a pity that the prices shown don't include the taxes till last moment | Agoda hide the bad reviews. Do not stay at Railey Beach resort and Spa. Dirty place. Agoda lies . | very good | very good | I'm an Agoda Platinum user and have been using the app for all my hotel bookings. But now, whenever I select a room, it keeps on loading and loading and nothing is happening. Have raised this to Agoda support but issue has not been resolved yet. It's very frustrating. | The best offers | can you call me | very good | it's very easy to access, hotel price cheapest from other portal option | Really it's spam aap because after the booking we will goes there property they should talk we not accept any booking of Agoda I am also facing a issue in Goa | Some hotels are cheaper in Agoda than in other apps. | good agoda | Very Bad Experience...I Booked Hotel by Agoda...But Property Owner not accepted booking and ask for Cancellation and offline booking in his own counter.... Customer Care Number of Agoda India is Wrong and not working... Very Bad Service... (-10) Rating Application....

Nothing but hoodwinking & plain cheating of customer by Agoda. Different search engines through up different prices for same hotel & same dates. This clearly proves the use of algorithms as a means of fraud. Beware of such methods from Agoda & needs to be looked into on a serious note by net vigilantes | I was a loyal customer. No more. You just stole my money , didnt correct the problem. | An easy booking pay at the hotel | great deals, however on my android the phone lags and cant load the items in my cart so i had to research and rebook everything and lost out on special promotions and bundles. i also cant seem to log in from email and password, i have to press use google account which is the same email anyway lol app is a little confusing to navigate | Too many problems with Agoda for last three years..Book a date and get to your hotel to find their app calendar changed the date. I've had this happen 5 times and my Agoda experience is now finished. | attractive price offered | good application | good | gud | Not trustworthy. The rooms you book and the room you get are different. Poor experience. Not recommended. No customer support. | works pretty good for finding deals. Thanks | keepup ur good service. | Very simple & easy | great deals | good | Very professional support staff | Fraud it's kind of scam it seems.. give booking confirmation asked for payment for any special requests then disappear..i doubt if site have verified hotels or not | quick and easy, best rates searched | Easy to use | good app | hope more discount | An absolute garbage this app has become. | great | easy to use and full of better deals | Alway use this apps. No other apps. Convenience and very helpful. The pay at the property option is very helpful. | good | valuable to money | very poor service total vasta of mony and very bad.. | not trustworthy 1) while booking air tickets it showed 7800 but after making the payment thru crrdit card 8193 was deducted. 2) first time booking was suppose to get 8% discount but not got that also . | Worst customer support and room options. Really frustrated with their services. | Jagan pakai aplikasi ini scam, sampai di lokasi tidak ada tempat tingal nya | very good | excellent | I usually use it when I go abroad. I never had any problems. The reviews are generally helpful and I can find good deals most of the time. | Excellent. | osm | Disappointed there's a fraud listing on the system. | I wanted to pay with Afterpay however most motels, when trying to book did not accept Afterpay. | My booking was canceled without consent, leaving me stranded and stressed about budget and vacation plans. Despite multiple attempts, customer service offered no solution. Would caution others to be wary when using Agoda. | Always excellent | Introductory discount offered if app installed However not applied due to 'technical' issues Offered $5.24 discount at the next reservation Avoid these scammers! EDIT. Email sent as advised with the case reference number Further to my review on google playstore can i say how disappointed i am that after enticing me to a introductory discount of pkr 2000 it has not been applied apparently due to 'technical' issues I have complained but i have been offered a discount for the next NO RESPONSE | good price | brilliant | best application | superb | so far... so.... | Worst experience ever. Will not give refund for a room I booked that didn't allow service üêï‚Äçü¶∫ to stay unless paid additional fee of $200. | Agoda as a platform has often given me one of the best deals. But since last 2-3 days, the app has been continuously glitching | good üëç | Can not use my master card any more. Around 15 bookings / per year but time to say goodbye with agoda. | its ‡¥´‡¥æ‡¥®‡µç‡¥ü‡¥∏‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥∏‡µç deal | Very user friendly and the greatest customer service support that I've ever received!!! Agoda must receive 10 out of 10 starts to my opinion!!! | good app | Its great for checking on/booking your stays, however the app AGRESSIVELY WANTS TO LET YOU KNOW THERE ARE DEALS. Even when you dismiss them. Like to the point it got in the way of me communicating with the property when I was typing a message to them and GUESS WHAT THERE IS A COUPON FORGET THE TRAVEL YOU ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO MANAGE!!! | very good | They keep trying to encourage you to use the app but the app is buggy mess in using bank promotion which they do not give you a code but the app does not sync properly with the bank promotion link. Now they obscure the price breakdown so you cannot see if the promotion was applied successfully. | Rip off and pointless customer service price match is a lie | nice apps | Á¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ | Very good app, go for it for hotel booking and more | found great value accommodation over again ta Agoda making my hard earned dollar go further | Good ..... ! | very good | easy to use and great prices! highly recommend | hidden charges are terrible | my bookings have not always gone through or something went wrong on the confirmation | easy to use, clear information, photos and location, thumbs up | Baddest app I have used ever . The hotel number is unavailable & not picking phone. The customer care team is saying we will get reply of email within 1 day & If I cancel the booking then it will take 30 working buisness days for refund Don't download this application","histogram":{"1":40339,"2":12053,"3":49677,"4":180064,"5":1503133},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":false,"androidVersion":"7.0","androidVersionText":"7.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"agoda.com","developerId":"6238151696356560844","developerEmail":"it-android@agoda.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.agoda.com","privacyPolicy":"http://www.agoda.com/info/agoda_privacy.html","developerInternalID":"6238151696356560844","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QFl5RnJnCaApuwSY5GkyPk1YqFRdeq-64EHaeNeYId3HwY9Uqjf5JkRVeATZxuuKez5o","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-S8ko79-ANB5LF051-qqHSYhL_Zk1TM55poxTd-gBA2P5ZaKBBOK9T6Euh0Ii3oiR8M","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zDiDpgGGfvQlA18zUCFTF7LFcDUbS7slrbEXl60L2bS63TcXw5me38NVTDORD5g1Kg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5l-E4kY3-oGap_TyTFHLGRON2-D8Psf0tlEuLaug3K6gPx9PZPLeoJkeWQMmt9JvPg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vfct4qoggUGe-vDeh8y0kSgxUOJem1FrqNmCwhnQ5mbpIndlc8gevAs_A2O9dKVNgdnD","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/duB--jYOnKNwAAfW8FJ3vvTPvyCgLr0CdYSzXij2L-CX3YngqXJ1h3gd7XhrITiDZc7Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ygWrNvbwwkyWZIfesesnGjtkj5pNS841DPG1aiqq2FPmuzuzySz91_gWjnwAVuIRbw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qOPMd3XsU5pg-Fr8ssRCaZVK-RM651D3GJ6ZBglwIVIbwQ1M8vqVZ-RlQvB2ZOi-CNog","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NA8zTavSL7IagyGa3c-hHOUVBpa4HSmgY0hbR7uhsoT5faWgyvs8Ky7XhsPx4-TsKzo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Agw-J9u7Il_O3R1jfxmMAvRTy_eg_H1x4SbgXeJwLDeTASCv3h0bs98LDI7jQlWT324"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Jul 6, 2011","updated":1710228549000,"version":"12.9.0","recentChanges":"Agoda now offers flights!

They pull this scam in hopes that you won't catch it and by tricking you into thinking they have a low price, they charge you at least twice as much and you end up totally cheated.

Then you get a Indian call center that has poor audio and cannot understand your problem. I waited for 40 minutes on the phone to try to get this resolved.

They have work to do with complex itineraries for flights, the UI is not as good in Android, there's no search function in Android, more travel stats would be appreciated (number of hotel stays, costs, number of flights etc) | early days ...but its looking good so dar ...thanks | makes trip planning easy | great resource when you travel | So far so good! No paywall (yet). Good UI. No bugs (Yet). | Useless Doesn't sync | Best travel app in the world üåé and not like I would have any bias... okay, but it's still the BEST! | Tripit recently started asking everyone to verify account with real name. They say it is to comply with global laws but refuse to say what law. They changed their user agreement saying you must have a real name which is complete nonsense. I have been using tripit for a long time with just a username. They just want to collect more data to sell to other companies. They say will not do this which is a big fat lie... | Been trying for 6 months to make it work..doesn't work..it works on the Web but not on app | Keeps crashing. Figures, paid for the pro version and the first trip we have a critical at risk connection in DFW. We are trying to pull up the map of the terminal and even try to use the directions on the app to navigate between gates. The app won't load either one of these functions and keeps crashing. I keep getting a message that the app crashed because it has a bug. What a waste. | Jalf my travel is not listed in the app .i have no Idea why or how to put it in or how to ask for support What a waste of time | I've used this app on 19 trips, starting in either 2015 or 2016. I like it, and it's always worked well. I have a trip this weekend and decided to use this app again. It kept crashing when I tried to look at past trips. I kept getting a got a pop-up on my phone saying this app has a bug. | App no longer functions on my samsung s22 plus. Your login system needs to be integrated with Google, Facebook etc. To streamline login process. | Can enter detail or summary as required. Useful tool keeps all info in one place plus historical records. Free version is fine for many travellers. Handles complex itineraries quite well. | When creating an account it does not accept several home cities. | Awesome! | An essential travel tool. | Can't even log on. Keeps coming up with an error! | Great so far | So happy to have this app. They are well organized and communication regarding flights have been very helpful. | I can now find when I am flying quickly. This is so important given airlines change flight times every 5 minutes | This is a good trip planning tool, which is also handy when you are traveling. It will automatically create trips from the airline and hotel booking emails you receive. | Fantastic App | great planning tool and lovely map feature | Best thing every for organizing travel. Easy to set up, ready to use... | So far it's been an excellent organization tool for me. The only glitch I've found is that when I try to share the plan with my travel companion it won't send after I add her email. | App now seems to crash whenever opened. | Can't even access the app. Tried to create an account and when I put in my password it says does not match their records, of course it doesn't because I haven't signed up yet? Had to go onto the website to create the account and then back to the app and it keeps telling me password is wrong, I've reset the password 5 times now and each time it won't let me sign in as password is wrong. Ill go somewhere else for my travel planning. | Confusing, hard to find email. Link setting. | Best of its kind | Very user friendly and convenient. These are all automated features and make the planning 10x easier. 1. Import flying details using flight number. 2. Timezone conversion 3. Hotel details import One potential enhancement: Might be hard to implement, but it would be even more friendly for apac trip planning, if separate display language can be selected for individual trip, as it might be more native for APAC locals to see the planning in their native language. | I am trying to use it in Doha. | Very useful for traveling and sharing with other travelers. | Hello. I can't invite participants via email. A message appears that the requested email cannot be attached at this time. The point is that there are emails with which there is no problem and there are those that do. I did a few tries and it seems to be completely random. There was an attempt with two emails that managed to connect and the second time, with the same two emails, I couldn't. How can it be fixed? | Excellent! | make my travel easier | The pro version is a must for frequent travelers - it makes your travel logistics much smoother! Basic things like letting you know gates changes to baggage pickup carousel numbers before airlines / FIDs can. Subscription cost paid for it self for me when it alerted me when a cheaper rate rate on same flight came up, with clear instructions on how to secure. It worked and saved me hundreds for our family vacation! Update: now saved my thousands over the years with the Fare Tracket! | Good yahha | Great . | it's very easy to use and links easily to trips. but I can't seem to set custom picture for trips which isn't great. I tried following their directions but it still doesn't work. | Keeps on signing me out and then having to reset my password and won't let me sign in on more than one device which is a pity as the app looks good | love it!! | Extremely helpful | The application is excellent, but unfortunately, I have encountered a technical issue where it repeatedly crashes. | The app will not let me log in. I Created a password but the app freezes when I tap the submit button. | App was recently updated and google login no longer works in app (does in website). | cool travel üß≥ app | Useless | such a great app. we travel a lot and it's indispensible | My flight on American Airlines was delayed twice and AA rebooked me on a different connection, but TripIt Pro never updated my itinerary, even many hours later. | Live & die by this app for travel, domestic & international. I've been using the app for over a decade. | does has list of all the cities and station in India | Very useful for trip planning!!! | Could be better | Love this app, mad glitchy though. Only thing is, when you share the itinerary with someone's email some details are left out. And they can only get an updated list of plans if you resend it via email or download the app. | Upgraded to the newest version and my past & future trips that were in the system have all disappeared. Have had multiple issues logging in from the mobile app, it opens the login into a browser then doesn't connect after entering all login info. | Crashes and does not save the IT I was trying to add. | Verry bad | 1-2024, keep getting denied access from phone and laptop. 11-2022 Not saving any itineraries correctly and supper buggy; keeps crashing. When it works it's great üëç | I have two long trips coming up, each involving a couple of train journeys and a couple of ferries. It got the dates right for one of them, and was off by a year for the other. It didn't pick the ferries up at all, and only found one of the train journeys. I'll stick with paper printouts. | For some reason, the app does not open and does not load once I enter my username and password; I can only use it on the website not on the app ; I have a Xiaomi 12 Pro. | App crahsing | I'm unable to sign into the app. I can sign into the desktop version. however, when I try signing in via the app it says \"an unexpected error has occured\". | Super helpful. | Horrible customer service!!! (or lack of) have deleted it after three emails with tech issues and no one getting back | Very handy app, the import function via email works well. Would be good if you could show a trip as cancelled status but leave it in the list so you can keep the details for future reference. | a great way to organize your trips. super easy to use and convenient | excellent app for keeping itineraries, tickets, bookings ect. | I love how easy it is to find all my travel info. Trip it not only automatically pulls the relevant info, but it also organizes my trip into an itinerary. My husband and I both use the app, and since he travels for work a lot, he can just forward info, and it gets organized by TripIt, and I can access it if necessary. | Don't waste your time with this one. It's a pay yearly at a very high price. Save the the money for your trip, there are better apps out there. | best travel app ever | very convenient aop! | Lousy app | Can't install nor update in Japan | Keeps crushing on a galaxy s22 ultra. On Huawei 30 pro works and I like it | This app has been very helpful in keeping track of my travel plans. I've only used the free version so far but will probably upgrade in the future | going to be using it on upcoming family vacation. Used it for a mini vacation and I never lost track of our plans and tickets or even confirmation numbers. I need more reference to give it any higher or lower of a review. | Free and works reasonably well. But too many trips are not automatically uploaded and I need to do it manually (even from main travel agencies like Expedia). 3 stars because it's free, otherwise it would be a 2. | I've used Tripit for years, mostly because there was no alternative. (1) It looks like with Tripit Pro you must have auto renewal -- no way to remove credit card so you must manually close Pro account. (2) No ability to add expense items during trip. (3) Long distance rail arrival doesn't display correctly on itinerary. | Very tiring logging in process Forced to uninstall it | This app is great for frequent travellers, easy to use and very convenient, stores all flight and hotel details, highly recommended. | Great organization travel app. | Been using this app for a number of years, and love it! | pro abit expensive | Can't always recognize absolutely everything you email it... A minor gripe as it's easy enough to input manually | Highly recommended for frequent flyers and travellers | This app is a great way to organize your itinerary as you build it. | you always know what to do next | It's ok let's you put all your trip info in | great program | it has very limited options | Great application. | awesome software! | the free side is great for planning and tracking...if I traveled more I would buy they full package | I've been using Tripit app for over 15 years. one of the most useful app for travellers | This only let's you sync your email and then it \"makes an itinerary\" for you. I was looking for an app that allowed me to make the plans. | Trips sometimes don't get updated | greattttt","histogram":{"1":2241,"2":643,"3":1564,"4":11549,"5":63464},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$48.99 per item","androidVersion":"10","androidVersionText":"10","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"TripIt, Inc.","developerId":"TripIt,+Inc.","developerEmail":"support@tripit.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.tripit.com/","developerAddress":"601 108th Ave NE\nSuite 1000\nBellevue, WA 98004","privacyPolicy":"http://www.tripit.com/uhp/privacyPolicy","developerInternalID":"TripIt,+Inc.","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Q5MO1O16dA5Bg22LIcNsmeyJYT8smqyRblAnUbJ7fJOCZsYrea_2khF0_XZvBo4f6NM","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bdhZeLVeHg-gAaqHMo3FfT1ERMS_DsJdTXk42u1ubGTWk0pm_irLZyzRDkn-OgyiFcI","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kYYD-2uoOcXcHDZrb17uHUSJHFnIAVb8ju2IWo0tgJibJJqTgyWy5LKCaIUe49mREZLV","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GTaoHpMTdMrWjN0DFJueTeDcl3Bes7YRYTw6OmAYUqzz3S6tznCuKOaN9cMedYc2Kn4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pNX92xJvwKIgzwT4qB0Z3Db-YGgEtAWFZ2QITV8QD4z9j-Byua-kWKmQvim9-9luYic","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BKMyyrmx1cS17o5v4u-GQJAeRMMW4wXiP_K1WisUPiPHJVYxq0wsh3zFCPtMnxdPqxvx","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XhR6WERdSqbDXZMJpakE9q9Iwh770m-SVdCCsI3tEg0YiV2Xb6vVP-L7d4ODSkzLu7nW","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Af1GnMKBtk6m0CDOLEq6jqSjPlEl6jzffls2J5xkzKQjbT9ySLGLL9IC2Hm6zhNMGI0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5_3_pPISPZ0WvRiVId4bwyY_94nkN5GuPYW-Se2pkAC8Wf0CcCT7veAQo2LClPPypAk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3A1mgm9VlbpsQlXyTL1FBrmQuyT0zSZZYXKhuXefZ-w24FD4F0kSjJzEmKvkauIyXGlj"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pOV27RKXCVU?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bdhZeLVeHg-gAaqHMo3FfT1ERMS_DsJdTXk42u1ubGTWk0pm_irLZyzRDkn-OgyiFcI","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"updated":1706937340000,"version":"13.3.0","recentChanges":"‚Ä¢ Now it&#39;s easier to add a flight manually with smarter default dates, and we fixed various bugs and crashes.<br>‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre gearing up for something big!

Rarely, in my experience, are the prices shown the prices the actual merchant is offering. I perpetually find hidden fees, too. I also struggle with searching using the \"whole month\" feature. Invariably the app states that it can't find any flights.

It would recommend trips that made no sense and I could find cheaper other places. I was highly disappointed since I loved the browser version so much and always recommended it to my friends and colleagues.","Upon updating the app, it appears that a lot of the previously removed functionality has been returned to the app. Estimated prices in the date window are back, although somewhat less expansive that I would hope (and fewer than appear using google flights). The bar graph view is not here though, which is disappointing. The explore feature doesn't feel streamlined and feels a little too \"curated\" for my liking. Estimated prices for suggested travel cities don't show up in the explore page.","The latest version as of 25DEC2020 is absolute garbage. Can't search a range of dates, can't find an option to search anything other than one way, and can no longer even get a price on the month view, just a series of colored dots with no explanation of what they represent. This is a classic case of trying to fix what isn't broken. This is a garbage update that I am proud to say will drive me to uninstalling unless it's reverted and never looking back. I've used this app since 2012/13, no more.","The New View is Terrible! Primarily for esthetics and functionality, please return to the previous format. Feels like an MS-DOS search. This was the best app for finding destinations. Part of the selection process involved seeing pictures of the destinations/prices and plugging in timeframes based on that. Now you dont see any of those things. Takes you straight to a calender??? The whole purpose of the app is to not HAVE to choose a date for your vacation.","Years ago, I found great flights on this app. I travel US to Europe. Now, all the cheapest providers that pop up are some BS companies nobody has ever heard of, with lots of negative reviews. No thank you. This app is now nothing but a waste of time. Uninstalling. Here's a tip: Every time I have flown for the last twenty years or so, Expedia has had the best deals and I booked through them. (For me, it's regular flights, no hotel or car, no last minute or standby.) Always a great experience."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"net.skyscanner.android.main","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.skyscanner.android.main&hl=en&gl=us"}

Beware | easy and fun to use | I hate this app since it changed! It never lets me log in! | patchy on response - says a lots of oops something went wrong... | trying to book a room for 3 nights at a holiday inn Express. It says my total is 212 with my key rewards and when I go to book and pay it jumps to 520 what's the deal? | APP did not recognize 2 nights stay at a hotel I booked though it, and didn't award rewards points. | good service and easy to reserve | Fun | Great site, very useful. | Don't download this app!! I downloaded it on my phone a couple days before my trip away and no joke 2 days before I went away my phone completely froze and stopped working. All because of the corrupt adds that the app kept trying to open, it happened randomly when I was using other apps and in the morning my phone was fine and my usual alarms went off. An hour later my phone won't turn on and when it did the screen was frozen. I would not recommend getting the app. | this is actually the first time I have used this app and it has been so easy. love it | helps and is easy to use. | You'll be lucky if it works one out of 10 times! | always manage to get good places to stay! | Funny | Super easy to use, & found the cheapest, & the best deals on here. | can't find booking | Very loud and could hardly sleep. between the stink of dogs, uncomfortable beds, and people walking above our floor, it was not worth stopping at. | I had a 5 star review but I'm changing to 1 star. The new \"verify you're not a bot\" requirement is terrible. I have done it 8 times now, I verified myself, searched a hotel verify again, view hotel verify again, new search verify again. This is enough that I am just booking through the hotels website. | good | The new Onekey rewards system is worthless. I get better deals and rewards using the individual hotel rewards systems now. I'll use this app to find all the hotels in the area then switch to app of the hotel I decide to stay at. | They have started using an infuriating verification process that requires repeated re-verification \"puzzles\" even when it says you got it right. (And the instructions are not even correct, telling you to turn the object in the direction of the hand instead of in the direction the hand is pointing.) I will start booking through another provider. | easy to use. | Complicated overview of reservations in random trip boxes versus simple list view. Not showing in receipt view if reservation is paid already. Missing send message to hotel option. No price guarantee option. | Worst booking experience ever. Not only did the app and website stuff up the communication between myself and the hotel, staff were off no use in trying to get a refund. Was stuck in another country with no booking, no hotel, and the best advice staff offered was to find another hotel. Currently out of pocket society $1200. Now having to drag this through court to recover costs | brilliant | When I wanted to cancel the hotel I booked, I couldn't because of the site problems,(technical issues)and the support also said that we can't cancel like you, they took about 2 days of my life time(IN JAPAN, FOR APA HOTEL IN TOKYO)I CAN NOT CANCEL THE RESERVATION UNTIL NOW,JUST SAID ME PLEASE WAIT.I NEVER AGAIN TRY THIS SITE AND APP, PLEASE BE CAREFUL FOR HOTELS AND EXPEDIA | best prices available | dope | No hassle booking online! | I can't even sign in. Pretty useless to me. | Best booking app around | awesome deals and fast spare of the moment trips | Easily find rooms and rates | best deals | Amazing | like my free nights | Very easy to use app. And very reasonable with the prices. | Your stamps disappear, within less than a year. You get access to slum hostels that won't let you check in without handing over various IDs , when you do have issues, it's your fault . There's a reason they offer insurance. | Very hatd to contact about an issue. | great app. very user friendly | It's only good to find hotels not to book them! | I always have a good experience | App is terrible | great prices and selection | I used their website to make a reservation. They did not send a confirmation email, nor could o find it in my troops. So I made another reservation. They charged me for both stays and would not refund the reservationI couldn't find saying the hotel wouldn't refund the money. It was their site not the hotel. | No help | Secure and confidential | it's great | bugs in room | Awesome front desk, very nice place, and incredibly affordable. | i love this app | best | Unable to see details of my booking. Getting an error message. Hotel says dinner and breakfast are chargeable but I clearly remember that I had included them in my plan when I customized the booking. | This app sucks! 6 times I've tried to log in and it keeps telling me there is an error in their end try again later. | totally awesome | the app sucks | Awful experience Sorry, something went wrong on our end Sorry, something went wrong on our end Sorry, something went wrong on our end | great saves time | Excellent | great pricing and super convenient! | I like being able to see so many hotel options in one place. The search filters are very handy. The eleventh night free is pretty cool too! | set me up for hotel with No room available! | tesco voucher did not work | Doesn't let me click on any hotel option. Always says that I am not connected to the internet. | one word ... Beautiful | Used to work. Now it just keeps taking you to \"Bot or not\" | great app | App freezes after inputting password or secure code. Tried several times already. | I have mixed feelings. App works great for me and I trust the company. Customer support was very great. But the app is slow (and I'm on Galaxy S22 Ultra). Also, I live in Turkey but I'm a foreigner and I would prefer app in English or Russian. I can easily change app to English but then i have to change country. If possible, i would like to be able to change app language without changing country | love the rewards and always manage to get a great deal | PERFECT! | Easy to use. | love it | Great way to book and save! | too many back ups | easy to search, decent rewards | totally awesome | App crash, loops since last update. | great | beautiful booking | Opt out scammer you failed | Rented a room at hotel cause the pool and when I went to check in I was told the pool was broke the night before. Still would not refund us or money and we didn't even stay in the hotel!!! | easy to use | great app, and it's easy to book on my mobile | Easy to use, great layout. Was surprised at how quickly I earned rewards | easy order, best prices, higly recomend | can't log in Rubbish | This was an amazingly good experience. Found a great location for a great price. | Excellent booking site. | I keep trying to update my email address and keep getting message something went wrong on our end and can't get it done. | This is the worst app I have ever been on. I have booked a hotel and when I go into the account I keep getting put back to the start even though I have put in the correct information. | App is poor. Shows my name etc. but nothing else in my account. Asks me to log in at various points but when I go to my account only option is to log out! Nothing else works. | Not sure what happened but apparently I am now a robot and can't do anything on the app but captchas. I think it worked fine when I used it a few weeks ago... RE: Developer response; Thanks for fixing that setting! Now instead I am only stuck repeatedly closing \"Too many requests\" pop ups. The app is no more useful than it was when I couldn't get past the ReCAPCHA's... | Great app for finding the right hotel. I really like that it shows what is available in surrounding towns near my destination. | Easy to use. Excellent rates and rewards. | The app is unusable now. I couldn't do anything because a credit card ad page would popup every 2-3 seconds while I'm trying to read any page I'm on. When I closed the app and reopened it, I was logged out and the \"sign-in\" button is totally unresponsive. I've tried 7 or 8 times now over the course of a few days. Trash. | love this app..best prices üòç | MARYELLE CH√ÄO N IS ONE | Good | awesome thanks | Very good app, booking in a few clicks. Update: login broken for a looooooong time | Just booked a hotel with a reward night that then deselected, so we ended up paying full price. Immediately tried to sort it through the \"chat\" (only way to contact anyone nowadays) with no solution. Very poor system with very poor customer support for a glitch on their app. Not impressed. | I love it here | 2024 - The app is buggy and Messanging your hotels doesn't appear to work, since I never get a response from the hotels. Other booking apps are much better and more reliable for this. Other than this the reward nights are the only reason I still use it. | After installing app. Everytime I click on a link in Google search, a pop up asking to choose action appears. Removed the app and now back to normal. Smh | fast and easy | no mention of $150 fee until I arrrived | poor service.i lost 2 stamps not added to my rewards nights. Plus there are a lot of hotels with old pictures that look nice but when we get there they are not the same ,they need to do updates with new pictures | useful app for trip planning | Can't sign in in the app, have to go to the website to see my bookings :( | Tu y | best price and easy to use. love the point system for free rooms | stupid sign in | good prices, easy check out | great rates | Although resident in The Netherlands, I want the App in English, but also with prices in euro. I have been unable to find how to do this | With a German Shepard puppy it was the perfect spot for our Escape from NY. Great location. Good resturaunt, basically in parking lot. Easy on/off 81. Served the purpose. | simple and efficient to use | I need to know. | better prices. better places. | Lots of hotel option. Easy booking. | Crashes or frequently errors with \"too many requests\". Update 2/5/2024 - still crashes, puts me in an infinite captcha loop. This is infuriating. 3/9 - still dealing with endless captchas. This happens with your site as well as the app. Useless garbage. | Great mapping feature and so easy to use along with best rated!! | good | Used to be good with the \"one in ten stays free \" system. Now it's barely 2% \"cashback\" now, only in company scrip. The rooms are cheaper on nearly every other app, more than makes up for the 2%. App messes up a lot and talking to a human is no help. Uninstalling after this review. | My go to for finding the best places at the best rates. | shows in different currency than the one I use and there is nowhere to change either | Keeps crashing and can't log in | Excellent site to reserve a hotel/cancel and earn points! | Wizrow Factory üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ | They have made this app WAY too difficult and onerous to open just to check prices. I will use another source from now on | Been a member for a long time. One the most consistent service apps. | Easy to find hotels to book | I currently can't log into this app and therefore have to use the website instead. It used to work but now it doesn't. | This is my first time utilizing the service. I'll provide a more proficient review upon future continuation of the application. | The What's New still does not include any useful text................... | Just designed to harvest your data and not allow you to make any changes | great way of finding hotels | exelente promociones | awesome | great options to pick from. | Worked perfectly well until the merger with Expedia. Now so slow and clunky it feels like we are back dial up Internet!! | incredibly easy to use with terrific results! | DO NOT USE HOTELS.CON. This is hands down the worst app I have ever used. I gave it another shot after my initial review in 2021 since there have been updates. It's still terrible. I just wound up booking with the hotel directly. Time to uninstall. | Very easy to Navigate through the process. | easy | Nice Hotels lovely discounts | Great Prices & So Far Good Customer Service | Ever since they sold out to Expedia, this app has gone downhill. The \"keys for cash\" is ridiculous. Takes forever to save up for a free room now. And now with this latest update, the app has been rendered totally useless. You can't enter a destination. You type a city in and there's no \"enter\" button so it just sits there and doesn't allow to complete your search!

Kindly fix the bug | It is easy to use. | Forces you to switch on GPS location in order to use the app, fafork sake, what if you just want to check a distant city? uninstalled, very weak irrational logic! | excellent app | I entered the city I wanted to visit, and all of the suggested activities were in a city over 5 hours away. That's pretty darn pointless. | Highly recommended | Good | Thank | love this app! have used it in Iceland, Paris, London and all over the US | Too costly | Great . | It's a great app to plan your trips but it keeps freezing and not returning to where I want it to go. | great app for qucik palnning | Best app to create an itinerary | shopping area and some attractions are not included | this app is so bad, no privacy, keep asking you to open location, so annoying | amazing idea amazing app | very helpful for planning your vacations3 | Love this app | Great . | I am everyday grateful to the people who made it possible to plan a trip to a place you've never been. There are some minor discomforts (i.e. sometimes info is out of date) but hey, I do my research before booking so I'm fine with it. | Great application | this app is a must for any city break. | So helpful... | I really like this app but the location thing is really intrusive. Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching. | I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.) | What I've been thinking | What a mess: I would have thought just by selection of things to do & adding to wishlist it would be easily available to add to a city plan, however wishlist items not selectable? Plans coming soon?? | \"IMPRESSIVE\"... This APP covers almost everything... Great Jobüëç | always excellent | I love this so helpful to plan your day. It would be improved if you could add all types of accommodation to your base as many especially B&Bs aren't recogised. | perfect and amazing | Before you can customize your travel plans and itinerary using this app. Now it just shows paid package tours and there are no options for customization. | iz | stunning! you can plan your visit in 5 minutes. select places what you are interested in, add them to your wishlist, create a plan and you have everything planned in 5 min. really intuitive. well done! | Amazing app! | Very good | Iv been using this app while I was traveling it's very useful to discover the most tourist places to visit | Love this app. Very easy to use and gives plenty of ideas. | ok | One of the best apps I used, especially if you're a frequent traveler. So easy to use, and ongoing. Would recommend to everyone! | I used to love this app. But it has clearly gone through a terrible overhaul to make it more profitable and less usable. This is a clear example of \"enshittification\" a process outlined by Cory Doctorow for how digital products canabolize their own value in search of growth. Can't plug in my own addresses and places, far less usability, far more ads. Delete. Goodbye. | It's just tours | not sure just started app. | Useless for people who want something interesting and non-Western. Major capitals with more than 10 million such as Tehran for example were missing, while a small town near me with 40'000 people was included in the app. | Excellent App. Trip planning option is very useful. | Great idea..if only it worked. Everytime I look up an activity in any location it comes up with the same error message. Can't open page. Uninstalled!! | Great for initial trip planning | osum | Always an error | very informative and helps with planning your holiday | Wow what a great app! The auto creation of plans from my wishlist is game changing for me. | Most useless info and self promotions | if i dont want to open up my location, it doesnt allow u to go further and the app hangs | good app however it should also include notes, doc upload, packing list, to do list, expenses features. then it will be a complete app for everything for travel. if not all then atleast notes and documents should be added | excellent | easy to use, the creation of an itinerary is awesome! | Could be better | OK | U like that | Mddr malek afsari | Very good | Perfect app.. hopefully add Arabic language also | It's amazing üòç | entrance fee | Love this app and the ability to design your own walking tour of a city. input your hotel address and the map calculates times to either walk or take transportation between each of the selected attractions. it's brilliant. makes planning a visit so easy. | Very useful for planning trips | I had read good reviews about this app, but apparently it only offers a number of paid excursions and activities. What I need is an app that recommends top sightseeing in the city. If that option exists in this app, they've done a great job in hiding it. | Awesome perfect best | I can dig it buy my back | Great idea in principle once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, on my first use, the main sight I wanted to see was incorrectly mapped in the app, and I wasted 90 minutes of a one-day trip trying to find it. | There was no plan on the city I wanted Just say \"coming soon\" False ad It's just a bunch of tour agency listed | t·ªët | Just it includes all the tripadvisor plans.. | Not good | Too many personal connections and details needed. It's a no from me | Commercial app, aimed to make you buy stuffs like tours and partnered with booking com. The tours are overpriced and looks like low quality. | Nice app | Thanking you | Just horrible - so inflexible. I guess this is useful if you want it to auto-generate a plan. But if you try to customize anything, it can't. Every addition defaults to the first day even of you have day 3 selected. Every added hotel, defaults to day 1 even of you aren't changing hotels until day 4. A frustrating waste of time. It's just trying to sell you a tour. Horrible. | Just useless | This app is awesome. It's a great help in planning a holiday. | This app is great! We aways use it for ideas and vacation planning. Only one suggestion - please, make more options to filter the itinerary plans according to the season - winter/summer/spring/ fall visits for the same location. It would be very helpful. Thank you! | I simply uninstalled ur app as mails after mails u give which i dnt like n u cant unsubscribe ur mails also otherwise d app is gud | great | Too few cities. Didn't find what I was looking for. | This app/company will add your email address to spam lists with no authorization, so don't use any of the SSO options when you launch it! How trashy. Don't start emailing me your newsletter just because I opened your app one time. | good experience in yelanaka oon bikes the feedback related vehicle are good, the way of approch towards the costumer was brilliant , the vehicle are well maintained with proper fueling in the bike that I have took overall experience was good | Creating new plans and editing existing ones could be easier, but it offers a wonderful service | Really great app for planning a visit somewhere. So many options!!! I just wish I could connect my trip accounts (hotels, flights, etc) for points and discounts. Also, it would be nice to see AAA or military discounts. Excellent app and I'm excited for this application's future! | was this a joke | I can not use the app, appear google notifc. Of loc. And I cant use | Love the website. But the App is not working. Android 12. Just white screen when I open it. | Deeply unimpressed. I had already put together my itinerary of Amsterdam and very few of the places were listed and some were in the wrong place. | ok so far | Happy so far even the app looks like iOS. Probably Flutter tech. I will do 5 stars if I can manage to mark as visited the attractions. | Permission hogger. If I say no to the location permission, it means no. Spamming it, will not change my mind. | Nice app, very easy to create an itinerary and to find great places to visit. Needs some improvement when changing the day within an itinerary. | All the app can give you is paid places tours. Nothing like real travel plans. | For your day tours, couldn't you include (or at least have it as option) a STOP FOR LUNCH??!!....then resuming the tour in the afternoon?? | nice app to use when planning a trip. They show a diverse assortment of activities in each city. I especially like that they have trip planning by day and desired level of activity. 1, 2 or 3 days plans. | Doesn't even work on my new tablet but good on PC or phone! | Great trip planner for international travelers. | Such an amazing tool, don't leave home without it! | Excellent tool for travel | I've used in 10+ cities and it's great for planning day-to-day activities and staying organized, and also finding things to do on the fly. It's really helpful that you can add other plans, like visiting friends, theatre tickets, etc. and find things to do based on your location so they're easy to walk to. My only complaint is when creating plans from a wishlist, it prioritizes location over operating hours - what's the point of getting somewhere efficiently if it's closed when you get there? | perfect app to plan your own tour or get private tours. Very helpful. | Location permission Pop up never goes away. That's so enoying. | All my plans disappeared after opening on the web | Not impressed by this app at all. I was expecting to be able to add sites in the cities I am visiting so I could plan the best route to see everything. Unfortunately, everything in this app was geared toward booking tours. I understand that they need to make money and, if you are looking to book a bunch of tours I'm sure this is great, but this is not what I was looking for. Huge disappointment. | Nice | Formerly useful app. This app allows you to plan a multi-day itinerary in some detail. You can take one of their plans and move attractions around to suit. Just a few small improvements would help: 1) Ten day trip maximum is too short 2) Should allow a fixed time for reservations 3) Should be able to change hotels to allow a multi-city trip UPDATE 2022-08 Sorry to say app and Web now useless as some recent reviews have noted. Zero stars | very helpful app for making effective use of your time in a city | Very helpful app, but a number of glitches and needed features make it a 3 star rating. | Just an app selling overpriced tours. Better to do a little research by your self. | Great app | Great idea - shockingly poor execution It's like first draft. Changes times & days in my plan. Unable to move them back. Can't add ANYTHING that's not on their list. Forced to have events one after another, as if I'm not allowed a break. Very frustrating & unnecessary | Music tour | Great idea, really helpful but UI is not intuitive at all! It's frustrating to use as I can quite add 1 day guides per day, but then it's over writing them. Just really confusing! | it's a good app | Keeps freezing | Exceptional. I downloaded map and managed to use it in offline mode. No need to ask others how to reach places. | I was really enjoying the app, I'm going on a trip in 2 weeks and it really helped me to organise things, I paid for tickets through the app and the money has left my bank and now the app has crashed. What do I do? | the app won't open... otherwise I love the app. please fix it | not working, exactly when i need it, with locally dowloaded data, every page is an error page | Please check after new update..the app is not working...I tried reinstalling many times but no luck...could you help me with that.. | Worthless now that it only works for booking tours | top app, incredibly useful. highly recommended | design your itinerary like a pro | Nice apps | brilliant app. | I used this app all over Italy. it's great! | Great idea! | Expensive and limited activities. Sometimes there are only 6 activities even though the place has more to offer. Other apps are better. | Excellent travel tool! | Tried using the app to plan a trip to Malta. The only plans it comes up with is for Valetta. Pretty disappointed. | nice app | Well organized and friendly app | My guide wherever I go. Use it to plan in advance for my trips and get the best deals | Excellent app. A must use when visiting a city that you don't know. Great descriptions of attractions and sites to visit. I love that it breaks out places to visit in itineraries. I highly recommend using it. | Super useful | A Nice idea: needs work especially coding? app struggles, however its a nice effort with potential. Would like to edit wishlist to make notes on selections? Website doesn't let you login with G suspect more programming issues. | Amazing! | Good app with lots of fun stuff to explore. Lovely to just browse info about different cities | Fantastic app for making city visiting plans. You can make your planning consistently, based on abundante information from the app itself, and then use it later in a real life travel situation. | perfect app | app is good, but needs equal functionality to web page. Also adding places & hotels does not work by name search anymore. you must enter addresses, this was a great feature to add your hotel or your place by name | Can I get all information regarding local town of India.... | perfect | Was very easy to plan my trip to Southern Spain using this app. Will use in future travels for sure.","histogram":{"1":375,"2":75,"3":450,"4":1875,"5":14801},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$4.99 - $49.99 per item","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"Visit A City","developerId":"Visit+A+City","developerEmail":"team@visitacity.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.visitacity.com","privacyPolicy":"https://www.visitacity.com/privacy","developerInternalID":"Visit+A+City","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2RPjnl2F36udTYWeutrdLcu67q8_OjyC4akOyHaN2RVrY2dY2L_gtt04EPP7UL9Npw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vtnEcCq94fAWcilxpK0K5ZADfDqJn7OGC_egYCh_5lT9pJb7x2bViFY9kdT8J-DXjE9m","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D2_XgwZ1SQkYV6Xq3Fm3gxcwF87A2N8z9dOdQtOG6SGEU2pkMksKBBt5QydcF2KRUz0v","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2SENJd17-wP8uZPVhg7eEpLr-4gBct3zFJmzAi-h2mk25lSEWKCowjbS5zvEwfFXkQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a0x2IJJbqjqGuAVFJL8sIqKHhjHMO4Xn6og_GxS5Yp0wEK6VShpwoa1tbdBHt1RZuNQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PhyVZRZI-4yBnVVU2-L1Ql8CI9qeAdimYek9WKDbNrSmv7vcshiUn8ijVtfSoxfDrxU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L9ZEr3UsxS-cDPdHAp4hy3a51y2YjIw9XRlZJIrKFZ8_e0spYDYPEylDA8AprTX6XW8q"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Apr 23, 2015","updated":1705430569000,"version":"4.1.59","recentChanges":"Visit A City, the ultimate travel companion, just got even better!

Sometimes I just want to check what suggested itineraries there are for a city I'm planning to visit so if I choose to not share my location, I would think it shouldn't be a problem. But when I select not to share my location, the prompt just keeps popping up. And when I leave to go home or sth, it actually goes over that too until I completely close it. A bit annoying. Otherwise, it's a great starting point for researching.","I really like this app for it's suggestions and putting together an itinerary. HOWEVER, I've noticed that a lot of information is inaccurate or out of date, including hours of operation and actual locations/addresses. I wish there were an easy way to submit updated info to the app developer. I would also like to see a way to manually add items to my itinerary (and potentially suggest them as official attractions to include in the app.)","I've really enjoyed using this! It's great for planning tours and excursions when the choices become overwhelming. I've used it for San Diego and San Francisco, and now using it for our upcoming Hawaii trip. Some functionality could be improved on, like setting times for activities, because I use it as a guide and not as a strict itinerary. Overall, great site and app.","On the surface this app looks great. I planned my itineraries, but didn't book anything with the app. However, once I got to my destination I found out almost all the information was wrong. It couldn't pinpoint my location (I have an international plan) and instead of informing me of that, it would just show me in a wrong location. I couldn't adjust it either. Then every single one of the times to get from place to place was wrong. This app ended up being a huge disappointment.","Perfect for trip planning. Start an itinerary and customize from multiple sights and activities recommended. Once itinerary is started, items are added to a select day of your trip, with a duration at site, and an idea of transportation between sites included. From there you can customize all information and organize in any order you'd like. There's even a map and list view. This app is free, easy to use, and highly recommended for any planners!!"],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.visitacity.visitacityapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visitacity.visitacityapp&hl=en&gl=us"}

You can also search based on a guide that speaks your language. | Great app and easy to use | Easy to use , great options ! | Very convenient and often gives 24 hour cancellation flexibility, one does not get with buying tickets directly. | Easy to use. Very user friendly. | Good experience | Its pretty bad and cheap move that we need to install a 35mb app to get the QR code(lesser than a kb)after the booking. Email sent load of information but the simple QR code. Pure waste!!! | Great app, easy to plan different activities. | I love GET your Guide!, I have used it since it first came out, and have booked countless activities from Mont St Michelle to Pompeii to Windsor Castle, abd the Eiffel Tower. Multiple times. I want my bookings to stay in my profile, so I can use the tour I liked again. When we upgrade app, they seem to disappear. This would make it better. Thanks! | Get your gide ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for making our turkey holidays awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è & please guys always do with Get your gide Thanks and regards Renjith &uma | Loved it. | Used this bags of times, fabulous. | App is good functionality works fine. But whatever trip or activity provider some are not good. | Useless app more then expensive i didn't have good experience you can buy tickets there 1-2 hours before less cost | Impossible to get the tickets without installing the mobile app. | Easy, functional, suppose it's alright. | Good | GetYourGuide is amazing - I have enjoyed excellent excursions using the App. | So far, I have enjoyed everything that GYG has to offer, and it has been really fun and informative . | Easy to use, brilliant user interface | Always a great service. I have used this app all over the world & have never been disappointed. The descriptions are always accurate. I just booked a helicopter over the Las Vegas strip. | Really great value tours and very knowledgable guides | Absolutely bombarded by pop ups and advertising the moment I signed up. | Easy to use and very detailed information. Highly recommended | BEWARE! This is the worst app and very false advertising when it comes to its 24 hour cancellation policy. If I could give negative stars, I would. I purchased 2 tickets today for an aquarium and within 1 hour I tried cancelling but they said my 24 hour period ended yesterday, when I didn't even have tickets! Not only this app but the place lead you in false advertising. I wouldn't use this app again even if it is the only way to purchase tickets. SUCKS! | I've used get your guide in multiple situations on multiple continents. You can find a lot of really great deals and I'm not really had any problems. | Horrible HORRIBLE PLEASE DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THEM, NOTHING THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY NEVER PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR TICKETS AND THEN 14 DAYS TO REFUND YOUR MONEY AND IF YOU LIKE ME SPEND OVER 180 DOLLARS IN TICKETS YOU WIll be missing out on that money. | Very helpful and trustable | Booked hop on bus and river cruise in Prague. Excellent value | All good | Great adventure great prices if you need a clue or to save on your trip get your guide | So convenient to have my trips in one app. | Great service iv had trips in Dubai and Thailand and everyone has gone perfect | Quick and easy booking | A very unsatisfactory service provider i asked to cancel the reservation, cuase of my mother's illness, they asked to provide the medical certificate. Dont recommend to any one | What's this all about | NEVER use this app and use their service! We joined the tour under this app as it was recommended by Google. As I needed to use my wife's iphone to connect to the car, I needed to type in the Meeting Point Address instead of pushing the Show Direction Button below. The Meeting Point Address is wrong! We ended up in a remote village through a dangerous road. The worst thing is that GetYourGuide blamed us for notshowing up at meeting point while it is obviously their problem. No APOLOGY! | Easy to use | Experiences booked with Get Your Guide have always been great. We have never had a problem, and we have used them about a dozen times. The app is also very easy to use. | If in Rome buy direct from tourist attraction. I bought a tour on number 10 bus,l from GYG and it took me over 2 hours to get it validated.... Absolute nightmare, definitely buy direct and you can't go wrong. | Excellent App | Very helpful can book all in one place love it | Good it is | Fantastic app , works really well , can't fault it , well done üëè üëç üòÄ | A little slow but it works. | Trough this app I've been scamed and the customer support didn't replay to my emails where i've explained my situation even though I've sent proof of payment and scam activity. | Easy to use,no fuss | Can't find where to change payment. Won't let me change my email. | Sorry easy and good price | Easy-to-use. | Does not work. | No one answers phones, or emails I'm trying to get a refund back which cost alot. Trip was actually cancelled. Try to fill in a refund form doesn't go through. It's been a week now trying all sorts of ways to contact these people with no luck. Not happy at all . | Easy to get tickets and cheaper than on the door or other sites | Amazing and Easy to use | Easy one for get amazing tour ü§©ü§©ü§ó | Website payment is not working. Had to get mobile app | Easy to use and very informative. | Always great prices and communication | so easy to find great tours!!! | Very useful | This guide allows crooks to scam tourist. Be careful with this app and the places you go | Fantastic experience | very good and quickly! | Makes tours very easy | Really good app for my tours | All in one place for tickets, reviews, and what to bring lists. Super easy to use and has good cancellation policies üòä | They were on time...a lot of information given, host also added extra time to show museum and old bazaar. | It is a really helpful app | Convenient | Great app for city exploring | Always helpful to plan something whilst away | Great resource for booking tours and 9 times out of 10 comes with a 24hrs cancellation policy which is a great addition. In some countries tours are cheaper than the going rate and in others slightly more expensive, you just have to establish if the 24hr cancellation is worth the difference. The couple of times we've used the customer service, they've been super responsive and very helpful. Very much recommend! | Great App, easy to use and very reliable on the pay | Excellent ap with very useful & accessible info about guided tours / walks some of which hadn't seen on other sites. Looking forward to my walks around old Krakov both royal & ghostly ! Clear succinct helpful info just what is needed. Perhaps an online map of meeting point would be useful for visitors. | Booked a cruise on the Seine. The trip was cancelled 15 minutes before it started with no other earlier message. What a waste of time. If there was advance notice we would have better spent our time instead of wasting an hour to cross Paris . The reason (excuse is more corrext) is that there was a natural disaster. Check the weather for March 5th 2024... just some rain An Indian couple we met while waiting told us that the same thing happened to them the day before ALSO. | Really like their tours and classes. Highly recommend! | cool | Easy to use. All the nice offers in the city you visit | A lot of different activities, so far no issues. Like it, it is great for single travellers so you don't need to stress out about program etc. | Easy to brows the different options and choose. Good prices and good reffered guides | Still waiting to import tickets 2 hours later. Rubbish | Great! | Just great for everything | Awesome app with discounts üôÇ | Lots of trips to choose from | Zero stars would be more realistic! Utterly unreasonable. Cancelled in error within 24 hours of booking the trip with 6 weeks notice. No warning on the app of 50% refund. ¬£150 of my money they have kept! One click, and they refuse to reinstate or use to book further options. Despicable ü§¨ | Seems very easy to set up. We will see how easy it is to use | fixed your app i book a lot of times but doesnt accept card paymemt always saying error | Great app | Doesn't accept any of my cards for bookings. I tried multiple cards multiple times in app and on multiple browsers. Ended up going with actual tour operators websites which did accept my cards. Also I sent an e-mail about this issue weeks ago and got no reply. | I can't book my tour no customer service | So many things to choose from all very well reviewed and cheaper than other places for same experience | Easy to book, shoes great deals | Easy to book | Love this app! So easy to use and so many great options for tours! | Easy to navigate and book tickets at competitive prices | Very easy to use and full of great suggestions | I have used get your guide in several places in Europe and have found them to be quite good. I wish that they offered more small tours in English now but I believe it's low season | Love this app! | Perfect | Easy to use | Very handy app for tourists | Fantastic clear description. Very easy to use. | Nice app | Makes travelling more convenient and comfortable! | Such good discounts | So easy to book trips! | Booked two trips while in Malaga. Camito del Ray and Ronda. Really enjoyed both as a solo traveller. | Very informative with lot of choices suitable for your needs. Either Single or with groups of friends. | Excellent app, easy to book, decent prices, and always my go-to site for foreign trips. | Easy to use. We used it in krakow and gave us loads of options of what we could do! | Best to use very quick and active | Walking tour of Lisbon on February 28. Our guide, John, was knowledgeable, thoughtful and personable. We saw a lot and learned a lot. Would recommend! | Great options for anywhere | Excellent app for tour booking | Easy | Very easy tp use and great value options. Love it. And makes your life easy. | More expensive than regular tickets. Also I booked my activity for a timeslot and got a completely different time. Scam. | IMPOSTERS!!! oh my gosh! The sponsored search result with an almost identical logo!!! What the heck? Not everybody uses Eventbrite for travel! The majority use it for local work or social events! | Easy to book Great choice of tours. | Great Booking with No Hassle | You are on your own if you make a booking after the 24h cancellation policy. They won't help you and you will lose your money. I have edited the rate from 1 to 3 because you made the Reimbursement after all, but I cannot give you more because I got upset after your initial support. Thank you for giving my money back and the 10% discount that I will not probably use. | Easy to use. | Love it, swear by it | Easy instructions | Trustworthy, reliable reviews and descriptions. Good value and easy to use and understand | Very large choices | Great app for booking tours form North America. Very helpful staff when I made mistakes with booking | Very easy to use. Alot of adventures u can find. Love this upp. | Must have app for traveler's!! | Very good and easy to use | Brilliant app when away and easy to use | Lots of tour options in many different cities.

Very easy to use, easy to cancel or change if you need to. | Easy to use | Great site for excursion tickets . Booked a few things through this now and would highly recommend üëå | Easy and convenient | I don't use a smart phone. I want to print my ticket from my laptop.

Instead, it just jump right back to YouTube... That's very very very annoying... Then you don't have all the songs or remixes... This app has been on Google okay for years, it's time to step up... | Da best! | Been pretty good so far. There are a few songs I've looked for that I haven't been able to find but overall, not bad at all. | Nice | Good enough for me thanks for this music app | so glad I found this. | Awesome App. I can find any/ all songs üòÅ | Music lol | I like varieties of music and I play on shuffle cause I like the random plays but i noticed it starts to only play the same tracks and doesn't actually shuffle and when I try to change it up it says the songs have to be refreshed and loaded, need this fixed for a 5 star. | when I can get into my music üé∂.

The only complaint I have, is that it doesn't have some of the songs I listen to most, or if it does, I can only listen to them from YouTube, and can't download it. | A like it but the only thing I don't like you can't download jakyll and hyde | It is a great app | Great app, my only wishes are that for large playlists, there could be a larger shuffle range and that the default page in the app would be my library. Not the Home page. Sometimes the Home page displays explicit album covers that I don't wish to see. I'd rather just stick to my library. | Wow, the number of ads is intolerable. If you try to download a playlist, you'll have to watch at least 1 video ad for every single song you want to download. Oh you want to search something? Here's an unrelated YouTube video that's going to pop up and auto play for an hour, and there's no way to avoid it besides closing and reopening the app. I'm willing to watch some ads for free music, but I won't use something where I get a pop up at least every 20 seconds. | App telling me to do something and it's still constantly stopping my music | This is the 5th time i had to edit this review. The app has gotten soo bad to the point everytime you hit play it stops or during a song it will keep stoping to play some stupid song for an ad or something every ten seconds. You also cant exit the videos because they pop right back up and i am extremely angry at this app to the point im not using it again. I dont recommend anymore. | Great app ! Thank y'all for a music app that will play offline and free downloads for most tunes. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç. | So good | The best | Ok app. The music moves to the cloud when you don't want it too, which is kinda annoying and sometimes when I'm trying to edit the name of a song, the suggestion box won't pop up, even when I know it has the song and album, which is also super annoying. But ok for the most part | I wish I found this a long time ago.

And no other app does what trebel does better. | Awesome | Excellent program! | I know they use commercials to help make money but do they need to have a commercial every other time when you download songs. After a while the app will just stop playing | This is so nice for music in school | Nice app....

However, I find it annoying that music will be moved into the cloud when I don't ask it to. I believe this feature should be able to be turned off entirely. Furthermore, it's absolutely ridiculous that music either already on the device (or music that has been downloaded through the app) skips and cuts out if you don't have a decent internet connection. Especially since playing that same music offline is so much more reliable.","Now that i've reached the last song on my download list, It did not load an ad. But then, The next time i download The first song on my next playlist, an ad will pop up immediately. Also the coin system is bs Because I want to listen to the songs That I already have, But I have to download new ones that I never even heard of just to keep Up with the coins so I can listen to my old playlist.","The ad situation is EXTREME. When I'm offline, Trebel is a five star. But when I'm online, the rating drops down to a two. I play a song and every five seconds I get disrupted from an ad video that plays over the song cover. I get that Trebel needs to make money and all, but the ads pause my song and then play another ad over it.

Some features of the app doesn't work (eg, Ask KLOOK) Lack of customer service. Klook doesn't run the tours. Cannot cancel once booked (they made it impossible to cancel). STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP. if you are trying to book a tour, go to the source directly. KLOOK is just a third party trying to rip off your hard earned money. DON'T GET FOOLED BY THEIR REPLY TO MY REVIEW. PROBABLY COPYING AND PASTING. And DON'T GIVE ME SOME LINK TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE VOUCHER IN THE FIRST PLACE.","Klook has made traveling a little more affordable when it comes to doing fun things. The reason for 3 stars is simple. The customer service area can be a little bit challenging. And if you want a refund they make it harder to get. Overall if your traveling plans go smooth your than klook is worth it. But if you gotta get a refund because of a traveling problem. They make it hard to get a refund. Update 12/24 If you wanna know whats the problem. Please contact me. Or leave a contact email","Booked transportation (Chinichi Co LTD) from my hotel to the airport in Japan. The driver never showed up. Tried calling Klook customer service, only option was virtual chat that was not helpful. Ended up paying twice as much for using transportation to the airport because I had to take a last minute taxi. Save your time and worries, and don't use this app for transportation services. Have not used any other services on the app, and most likely will not based on 1st experience with app.","The app and the website don't work well together. And customer service couldn't help with that. i made my very first booking using the website, and it's apparently impossible to transfer the voucher to the app. Useless.","Klook is a great middle person for travellers and attractions. It helps to streamline everything into 1 common app. Now, sometimes it is better to just buy it from the attraction's official site itself but majority of times, it's actually cheaper here. In terms of user experience, it's easy to use so far. Never had to cancel any booking myself so I can't comment on those experience. And I hope I don't need to."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.klook","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klook&hl=en&gl=us"}

It wasn't worth the hassle!!

I have been going back and forth for over an hour. I am outraged. | I can't log in | love the site | Poor customer services held my refund for 7 to 10 days and couldn't accommodate my stay for myself and children.

So if you can't sign in the what's the point of the app? | Do not use Travelocity! The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I thought I had booked a room for one night on the same day. I got to the Motel and it had booked me on another day that the app chose for the best price! The clerk spent like 40 minutes speaking to Travelocity. So I decided to go through my app and got everything straight or so I thought.. finally the clerk said it will still be a while. I had enough. I had to be somewhere in a hour. Tried to get a refund and they refused. No humanity at all! | The gentleman at check in was very nice, friendly and professional. Unfortunately, while the room was very clean, it was also very austere. no attempt at any ambiance. No closet, only one night stand, and absolutely nothing on the walls. Also, a one inch gap at the bottom of the entry door which allowed a cold draft until we stuck a towel along the gap.

Makes it super easy to plan a trip | excellent app for look a airplane tickets | user friendly | Stuck forever on searching for return flight | I've saved so much money with Travelocity. I've planned 2 package trips to Vegas with them. flight for 2 and hotel both times and have had 0 issues. got the top floor at the strat for an absolute steal. | Travel is freedom! | Quick and easy to navigate | Good app | AWESOME SERVICE. HAD ISSUES WITH A HOTEL BOOKED THRU TRAVELOCITY. AFTER TRYING TO TALK TO HOTEL DIRECTLY TO DEAL WITH ISSUES WITH NO RESOLVE, WE DECIDED TO TALK TO TRAVELOCITY. THEY DEALT WITH THE HOTEL THEMSELVES AND REASSURED US THAT EVEN IF THE HOTEL WAS NOT REFUNDING MONEY, THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE THEY EXPECT MORE HIGHER STANDARDS OUT OF HOTELS THEY BOOK FOR. WE WERE SO SATISFIED, WORDS JUST CANNOT EXPRESS HOW FOND WE ARE OF THE SERVICE. | I've used Travelocity for 20years, I get the best rates, and they have the top of the line staff to assist you. I highly recommend Travelocity! | The bundle option is great. Searching low to high listing first some times sucks because they aren't always lowest isn't always first.resorts and hotels must be paying to get on the list higher up | It is pretty run down and costs a lot. Half of the light bulbs were not working, paint was chipped off the walls, and the door lock was broken. It didn't feel clean or that safe. Not a good deal. I would recommend finding a different hotel | Do not book with Travelocity. If there is an issue with the airline, it's a nightmare trying to get anything done with these guys. | thanks Travelocity üíï | it was easy. a great hotel. | so far so good. it's been useful to find travel needs last min. fairly good prices usually. especially if you dig a bit. | smooth as always!! | nice work | Hacked | i spent all dsy trying to book a flight, no luck | good app | I like the business, and customer support people are nice. But app & site doesn't recognize my yahoo email that I used, and now I can't keep track if anything changes. No one from customer support has been able to help with this so far. | Always easy to use app! Good info and choices offered for my travel needs. | excelent facilities. clean and friendly people. | can't log in | So far my booking is going as planned with no issues ! | I love Travelocity for travel advice and looking up flights. I no longer book my flights on any discount service after United changed my flight times 4 times before a trip. I'll look up flight options and times, then book my flight directly with the airline that is my choice found on Travelocity. otherwise, it's a great app. | This travel app has gone down the tubes. They're playing games with the prices. If you don't book the first flight you check, when you go back to it again the price has gone up! They don't show you all the flights either. I'm done with it after all these years. You're better off going directly to the airlines website. | Love will use this again | Works okay mostly on my phone for the wife to use | great website to book any hotels or flights | It is useless. i created an account solely to have the ability to check and assure safe flights of family members, and this app or website can not even deliver that. How does one manage to check one's own flight under these circumstances. Boooooüëéüëéüëé | Exelente via de encontrar lo necesario | trying to login with my email and it will not let me type my email address | It's almost impossible to navigate or go back one screen. | easy to use & helpful agents if you run into any issues | They have been great with all my travels | couldn't get my eticket. not users' friendly | iwantagreatdeal,donewithgreatskill .whodoicall? | This app sucks. I just created a profile, and I know what password and email I used, but it does not recognize it. I also made a reservation, and it can't find my reservation even after giving the reservation number that was given to me | I always use Travelocity, they do a great job, and if there's anything wrong they are quick to make it right. | great comparison | have been a Travelocity for years. never have i had a problem gracias | Very hard to get around the site. I wouldn't waste my time downloading this one folks. I spent hours trying to book a simple flight That Travelocity kept putting whatever they wanted in my choices and half of the things you click on do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Try putting your area code in. I couldn't I just type it in with my number.????? I ended up calling united airlines and they gave me a better deal than Travelocity. | Booked a flight and paid for seat selection but was not given a way to pick our seats. Went through HELL with the airline to get 2 seats together. If your site is going to offer seat selection at an increased price then it should allow us to pick our seats while on your site. | the app was easy to use and the member discount was a big help. | Simple and convenient | Great app and service. Thanks! | GET A TRAVEL AGENT INSTEAD. I booked a flight and hotel for my parents for their 50th anniversary. Plans change and half the money paid was not returned. Called agent to cancel and was told policy gives them permission to keep any and all charges for any flights. Any subsequent reply by travelocity will just be to excuse themselves and justify their actions. BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU ARE 1000000% SURE YOU YOURSELF ARE GOING. DO NOT BOOK AS A GIFT FOR LOVED ONES OR FAMILY. 0 STARS. | So Far Great | great app, I use it every time I travel. | Easy | the app seems to be with a glitch | This is the worst app for booking travel & lodging.

Now it's unusable because it keeps asking me to complete puzzles to verify I'm human. As soon as I complete one puzzle, it reverts back to the puzzle screen and asks me to complete another one, add nauseum. | Always fun and seamless. | Great app | I am trying to sign in and the keyboard screen disappears before I can enter information. I have attempted several times! | Be aware !!!! They are charging the same hotels amounts on my two different credit cards | I can never log in to the app! | wonderful prices | Great . | it keeps crashing saying that it's bots | it will not let me past this bot verification. | Smooth, easy to use, very much appreciated!! ‚ù§Ô∏è | Very thorough/convenient! | luv this App | easy to book and use | Enjoyable to use! | Won't let me sign in!!! Super frustrated right now!!! | Difficult to maneuver site | Love it | told me the hotel was 1.38 miles from where I needed to be. but the hotel was 3 states away | Do not use this app or company!! Absolutely terrible, charged me over and over, and the people who you are supposed to get help from are really bad, impolite people who dont help and talk to you like a piece of dirt . It was the worst experience ever! 3 days later, the money still isn't back in my account and the rooms are sold out ! | Great prices! | good service | Despite being the little brother company of Expedia, I find the site to be better and customer service better. | Horrible app | service was exceptional | this app won't let me pick what airport I want to go to | very helpful, got discount. easy to use. | took care of me when the hotel cancelled on us just a day before our arrival, they did this at no extra cost for me, I will definitely buy my future vacation packages from Travelocity. | App took my 2 night booking request and stuck me with one night, then tried to get me to pay 3x the price, plus a series of fees to add the second night. Found the same hotel for both nights cheaper on Kayak,so I got swindled by the gnome | easy to use | I'll never use them again. App doesn't work, no record of my booking. Had to contact airline directly in the end. They turned a simple task into a stressful nightmare. | Great app | great | App won't allow me to log in. | change captha to a another authentication company soon. | Travelocity is a fast and easy way to arrange flights,hotels, and car rentals. It was a breeze arranging our next trip | They have no military discounts last time we will be booking with them | not the best | can't even enter my email to bring up my account without the app cutting me off | I keep getting signed out. it's frustrating. | Quick and punctual for reservations of any sort! Used it for years now, fully recommended! | great price , quick | This is the easiest way to make travel plans! | sucks | I have received the best car rental prices through this site. On the return of my rental vehicles I've seen people pay 2 or 3x as much as what I pay for half the time. I highly recommend Travelocity. | pain to navigate. need my flight numbers, not your numbers | why is the default date 2 weeks away, it should default to today. now I have no reservation. | bad seic | quick and easy!! | Great deals | I had the worst experience. They didn't refund my money after I had cancelled my hotel booking even after the hotel didn't deduct any money. I was booked onto a flight I didn't know I needed a visa for at one of the layovers and they still didn't refund my money. They don't even deserve a star. The agents are very helpful and quick to help in the beginning but as soon as payments are made and the client needs help. All of a sudden they can only do texts yet the would call previously | EXCELLENT VERY GOOD APP | Requires sign in, but doesn't allow access to the keyboard. If you don't want people to use your app, just take it down. Don't make it unusable. | pretty simple to use | Sucks | nice people clean rooms | Can't pay online or nothing | Garbage | Unable to enter password enter 1 letter and the dropbox goes away and can't enter anymore.

The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I thought I had booked a room for one night on the same day. I got to the Motel and it had booked me on another day that the app chose for the best price! The clerk spent like 40 minutes speaking to Travelocity. So I decided to go through my app and got everything straight or so I thought.. finally the clerk said it will still be a while. I had enough. I had to be somewhere in a hour. Tried to get a refund and they refused. No humanity at all!","The gentleman at check in was very nice, friendly and professional. Unfortunately, while the room was very clean, it was also very austere. no attempt at any ambiance. No closet, only one night stand, and absolutely nothing on the walls. Also, a one inch gap at the bottom of the entry door which allowed a cold draft until we stuck a towel along the gap. Will not stay there again.","Date auto reset placing the reservation on the wrong date... they corrected the issue... then the reservation I made got canceled without any notification because the hotel was overbooked... they worked furiously for a half hour to find a room, but there is no availability, so they sent me an email to send a receipt when I found a room. So they charged me with no place to sleep on vacation. Thank you travelocity... you suck!! Perhaps only the first part was the apps fault, but...","I used Travelocity all the time, but the app will not let me sign in. Every time I try to put my credentials in, it lets me put the first letter in and then nothing else after. I have deleted the app and re downloaded it several times with the same issues. This has been going on since June because I had another trip then and I had the same issue.","The customer service is terrible even if you give them a lot of business like me they will not care. Note: even if you pay the insurance $9.00 you can not change reservations BE AEARE. The app is a scam because they let that option be enabled in some non refundable cases. Cherry on the top: you'll get zero points for traveling, also ZERO benefits for long time customers.

When my departure date is near, both my round trips always cancel. Then they leave me a few options to change. However, the change flights caused my transfer flight to be delayed. Despite this, I even had to top up the difference in order to change the airport, and they refused to waive off the fees. Superb disappointing. | inconsistent in booking. changes the flight details and marks up additional fees. | too much AI auto bot not enough human beings to talk too... | The app is pretty user friendly | best travel deals | too many add-on, advertises make comfusion while purchasing. easy to trick people pay extra for misclick | I am a newbie but my first experience is Extreme satisfaction for now. | Great app | memudahkan untuk travel | Excellent | Very easy and a very good price | Downloaded the app because it was advertising under $100 flights to Vancouver.

In case of cancellations they will never refund you. | In app and via the website, the service constantly cancels the flights and then provides them again only to cancel, then again at 5x the price - only then will the booking proceed. The cheaper flights listed either never existed or are via an algorithm to fool you into booking an expensive option via frustration. Avoid at all costs. eDreams and Trip. Disgusting. P.S: there is no booking number, I did not fall for this blatant price gouging. | fast at realable transaction | good | Plenty of hotel choices, fast booking with good rates offered | I selected direct journeys only but it booked the return ticket with change | Extremely Horrible experience Horrible policy to ask a death certificate for a family member which I told your team 3-4 times via email that, I do not wish to provide the death certifcate/Medical Records of my deceased uncle and ask my cousin for it as its not normal to do so, to ask a persons whose father has passed away for a death certificate. I would highly appreciate that someone senior from your management contacts me as I had the DISPLEASURE OF speaking to someone named Anaikn | First time using this APP but flight keeps getting cancelled and ruin our plans. We have altered for 1 time but it gets cancelled again. Called customer service but wasn't helpful and issue not resolved. Bad experience in using this APP. NOT RECOMMEND!! | One of the worst ticketing site. After seles services is very poor. | extremely long period of refund | They refuse to delete my account (despite I didnt have any bookings or purchases or anything) :,D not too GDPR friendly, I guess they sell all your data | easy to use | Used it heaps.

Support is now examplary, fast to resolve issues. Hotels: Accurate information is now the standard, very rare bad surprises. Flights: except online check-in rarely available, all services like adding more luggage or lounge last minute is very convenient. Some issues with flight change fee making the change/cancellation insurance completely useless but it seems to be a bad trend started after covid. | This app dows not show air india express flights | Easy and straightforward to use | good | Imformative | Transperant discounts & most reliable materialisation of bookings | fast and reliable | Very good | No booking | Marvelous app | super | Good | this app is very good | The app just works fine. I recently booked a roundtrip ticket from Rangoon-Kuala Lumpur-Rangoon. The return ticket for AirAsia Berhad has been issued right away but the ticket for Rangoon to Kuala Lumpur is still pending even after I had already made the payment. It says they will issue it before 12th March. I don't understand this. | good | Flight tickets too much expensive should be reduce price.. | good | Excellent platform for bookings. | Amazing Apps that I can get and recommend to everyone with a lot of Amazing deals and promotions for different holiday transportation. | Great and easy to use | Far too busy, far too many pop ups. Next to impossible to find my Railcard which is the sole reason I downloaded the app. Not worth the hassle for the discountd Railcard as can't be transferred to other apps e.g. the official Railcard app. | seddek | you cant get help on cancelled flight and will route you to airlines | Best for travel | good | It is one of the best booking sites I have ever used, and probably the best prices overall.

This app is an absolute joke. | good app | quick easy such amazing source and options for stays during travels | I WILL NEVER USE THERE SERVICE EVER AGAIN, THE PRICES ARE LOWER BUT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR PLANS THEY GIVE YOU A RUN AROUND AND WON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY.... ITS BETTER TO PAY A LITTLE MORE AND YOU HAVE PEACE OF MIND FOR ANY CHANGES... TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. SUCH A SCAM COMPANY, I RECOMMEND NOT TO USE THEM | Worst experience ever, don't you ever think of rescheduling your flight they will take all your money and if you want to cancel your trip they will not refund anything even if you buy the cancellation package | amazing | Need the air fares in INR | good | dope asf | good and impressive | great service | Railcards do not load with poor or no signal meaning they can't be shown on trains with poor signal when requested by the ticket inspector. Trip will not give you a download code to load it into the official Railcard app that allows offline loading of railcards. This means you are open to being fined for not presenting a Railcard due to Trips poor implementation of the Railcard feature. I believe this falls foul of the Railcard T&C's so I will be reporting it to them | Poor can't ring them | The reporting service is just horrible. It's a complex web of not allowing you to get across their customer service. | not applicable | gut | Pilihan pembayaran sulit | Good | Good | Very good app, user friendly! I will use this app again in the future! | Reliable app. | Good | me | I travel quite a lot . For the first time I have remembered whom I used. This app behaved fine. I had to go to airlines site to check in but it worked fine with details provided. Saved app details for future travels about Asia etc. I am to be honest most impressed. It does what it says on the tin and is reliable. I'll upgrade to 5 stars if this continues over the next few weeks. | This is all fine | I booked a flight but when it comes to payment it always saying payment failed with card that I have used, even I already tried two different (working) debit cards. | Excellent | Big liar application When you select the date from the calendar that time price display very cheap and when you select that date, all flight price display very high. So making fool to attract customers. | So far use this apps for maybe 3 or 4 yrs already and I really like the services of this apps. It's really help me and the CS also good and they really help it when you have a problem.

App shows a tremendous deal on an upcoming flight that I want to book. Via the airline's website, the cost is about $900. Trip's cost was closer to $500. Same flights/same days. Great deal, right!? As I'm trying to book it, a pop-up message appears \"Sorry. This flight just sold out.\" Attempted to book another flight to a different location... EXACTLY the same pop-up. Bait and switch. Sketchy. Do not recommend!","BAIT AND SWITCH Disappointed. App and website shows a tremendous deal on an upcoming flight that want to book. As soon as you try to book it, a pop-up message appears \"Sorry.

Started with a web search showing a room available, but needed an account to access the deal. I downloaded the app, only to find the room was \"sold out\". I doubt it was ever available in the first place. Also the app spams me with notifications. Even worse, there's a 7 day waiting period to delete my account (linked to Google).","Imo, the main metrics of quality of a travel app are cost and the simplicity of getting returns. The cost differs on destinations, so I won't say much. The return policy is weird. They are honest when you did everything right, but the interface is so ambiguous that you are likely to commit some error while attempting to. And then they'll blame their app's fault on you and not fix the issue. I lost 660 USD this way."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"ctrip.english","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ctrip.english&hl=en&gl=us"}

The 'Booking' app has always emailed me back immediately. HostelWorld also does not care if their vendors constantly charge more for their rooms despite it being priced differently on their app. 1 star for stealing peoples money and not emailing back on MULIPLE occasions. | The idea behind the app is good, the implementation is decent. Looks like a MVP generated by a small startup, has minimal functionalities, can't put payment details from the app, no customer support, no information about payments | they don't publish honest reviews when terrible experiences are had by clients. They also don't do anything about the bad experiences and don't hold their hostels accountable. | Good üòÉ | A hostelworld error caused me to lose money. The response from the customer service was as if its my fault and they made out that I should be greatful for a small amount of the money I lost, back. I responded and have not received a response back. Really bad from hostelworld, makes me not want to book through them again. I lost two nights worth of money and it ruins my travel plans as I have to stay here now because of being charged twice. Wouldn't refund 1 night to stop me being charged twice. | great way to find nice hostels in Japan. haven't tried it elsewhere yet. | Great choice | just joined. so far so good | Unable to view any previous trips, leave reviews or use the chat function. Disappointed. | great value ! nice people | Don't recommend | Very creative mind to let people socialize. very innovative thinking, should bring more similar initiatives. Good job | Easy to use | Works well. I can quickly book a night on the spot around. Great value for a backpack trip in Japan. | Nice but seems more expensive than Booking, also no fidelity program ! | No use (don't know if it's temporary issue/permanant one). App is not able to book hostels in Iran. | works fast, plenty of options. I still don't try the customer service. | That is perfectly | A very easy way to book a hostel and have some recommendations | European university of germany location | this is scam app . I booked through it and they took 10$ and gave me confirmation however I contacted the owner he informed me that there is no confirmation and not available and he told me I have to book through other websites! scamm scammmm scamm ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | Favorite app for hostels for sure. Love the Hostelworld fam! | the best deals ever!!! love it | It's ok and provides a decent amount of hostels. However, when I try to give a review I am getting an error and cannot submit it. So, I would not trust the reviews. Check trip advisor or other platforms before booking. Or use a different one altogether | one of the best app that help me when i travel and they have amazing stuff | Great app! | they lay out things very easy and the app is highly efficient and intuitive with easy ways to change currency and so on. usually find the best prices here too :) | Can't favourite hostels? Hostels appear in an order (paid for?) | One of the kind it is a perfect app | so excited | The app is easy to use and all the info I need is provided. plus, I love the convenience to cancel our change dates if necessary. | I always had nice experience in these hostels!! | efficient booking system | horrible | I used this app a lot, but now they run so many annoying ads on YouTube I decided to use competition instead. | 5-‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Five Stars | good but annoying I keep getting adverts to use Hostelworld when I already use it lol. algo is messed up | Great information | I've traveled around the world for years, and this app has been absolutely necessary | very useful | App for hostel lovers and travellers | great | Tuve que cancelar una reservaci√≥n a causa de la cancelaci√≥n de un vuelo y no me devolvieron el dep√≥sito que hab√≠a ya pagado con mi tarjeta de cr√©dito a hostelworld... Muy mal que al cancelar la reserva no reembolsen el dinero.... | No longer worth getting a hostel when they cost as much or more than a hotel. Plus more are moving to piece meal microtransactions which ruin the experience. | good | the site keeps having problems with credit card payments. seems like something you'd want to fix | easy to use plus so many options & information | I decided to delete app after downloading but the deletion process is really long and not friendly at all. There is no need to do it such long, please don't play with people's nerves and accounts/data. Thanks. | Excellent app for booking hostels. | Very nice application for hostels | love it! convenient and easy | Cool and easy app to use, but customer support is very shifty, you can't call them and have to go trough a long procedure to finally kinda get in contact and have to wait 10 hours for a response. In my case that was terrible, I accidentally booked twice because I didn't receive any confirmation the first time and the second time was the day of planned arrival in the hostel, if there was a warning or something, hey you already booked or hey, you wouldn't be able to cancel, but no nothing. | Godsend for solo travellers | easy to use and intuitive | By far the best app for booking hostels while travelling/backpacking. literally a must-download if you travel. | No longer able to see Linkups without booking the specific hostel. Being able to see linkups was a very useful feature to decide which hostel to book. | Fake app. I made a reservation but on reaching the hotel they said they were not even aware of an app/site called Hostelworld. I paid an amount for pre booking and there is ZERO customer support. Looters. | Thank you very much and useful ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞ | I've used hostel world 4 times this year.the app is easy to use I've never had any problems with hostel world . until COVID they took 2 years to give me my deposit back. | always my best choice with hostelworld | Booked a hostel that wasn't even available, but it still showed up on hostelworld. I was turned away at checkin, but this company kept my deposit and refused to refund me | so far so good | This app looks very pretty on the surface, but it can't even find most of the US cities (large and small) that I enter into the destination box. It would be a very good idea to work on this issue if you want anyone to use it! | Great app that makes searching and booking easier! It also allows you to meet with other people in chats beforehand. I absolutely love this app and use it whenever I solo travel. Heck, some of these places, I'd even have a friend book their own stay with me! So worth it for socialization. You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you! | Easy and fast. | great app :) | Been using this app and website forever. It's never let me down. | Generally works fine,the discounts for the hostels seem quite good. Would be better if this could work offline just in case I don't have an internet. I'm happy with the app, allows me to go places I couldn't afford otherwise, especially in expensive cities like Dublin and London. Also only some hotels can be paid partly by card and the rest by cash on the spot. | Bad experience with no support I paid the advance of the booking for you The rest of the payment didnt want to proceed and its not my fault No support from you or from the hostel neither Anyway it was just an advance of 25‚Ç¨ but believe me you lost a client I dont recommend this app | Efficient and reliable - typically has cheaper pricing than I can find elsewhere | good app for Booking premium hostels | Hostelworld does not care about the safety of travelers at all. As long as they get money, they do not care if the hostel is safe or responsive. | Best App | Have found so many great hostels thru this app! The reviews are usually quite trustworthy | They don't help you if you cancel a reservation because you discover the hostel is lying on pictures | No CT locations | App didn't work. I tried to log in with 3 different browsers, but it just keeps hanging instead of logging me in. Total waste of my time. | worst service. They took my booking. when I reached hotel. hotel cancelled booking and denied room. In this situation Hostel world customer care did not respond to my mails or call. they took payment in dollors. My money also not refunded | weee | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Great app for finding affordable places to stay around the world. My go to as a budget traveler. | Great concept unfortunately the app is quite buggy (account creation is very difficult because it doesn't want strong and secure passwords, or doesn't display what's wrong) search criteria is too strict (typing shenzen instead of Shenzen will result in no result for example) | Unusable. Installed app to try out the chat/social features, since to book I just use website. After the log in screen it sits loading forever. | Easy :) | Absolutely unreliable. I make a hostel reservation, I am charged the pre-payment from my bank account, and then I am informed by the hostel (not Hostelworld) that my booking with them is not valid. I contact Hostelworld's customer care and ask why my booking apparently has been cancelled. I receive NO reply or explanation, only an automated e-mail saying my Hostelworld booking has been cancelled. Nothing about the fact that I should get my ‚Ç¨20.09 pre-payment back! I am massively disappointed. | simple, very easy to use. quick way to book | easy to use | perfect | Great experience ... | I love it. | Ok | ok | great services | It's a world wide party, lots of ladys | it works | doesnt remember date selected | Lame gukuss | Site etc is fine. But app missing features. You can't see distance by current location. You can't hide female only rooms. Basic things for travellers | My favorite Hostel booking app! | I went last year the location was amazing amazing the staff they are super nice and the breakfast was so yummy that's why I booked again this year | very good apps | IT didn'tüö´seem to like my credit cardsüëéüèª‚ÄºÔ∏è | Booking Cancelled without intimation. We had to again look for different Hotels for stay. | excelente | Lost nearly $300 because Hostelworld refuses to take responsibility for the hostels they support. I've complained several times about a particular hostel (because my experience was awful), and they have done absolutely nothing about it. That hostel is still listed. I used to love the Hostelworld platform, but I think I will make the effort to contact hostels directly now instead. Also, the Share Your Trip feature hasn't worked for the last several stays. | Please update your app it's unable to fatch my location nither able to search any place. Useless aap. | I have found multiple amazing hostels through here and highly recommend this app. | wonderful üòòüòä | I'm unable to view my past bookings | Searching for locations doesn't work | Thank you the ease of an experience to book my reservation online (Theough the app). | Horrible App. Pricey. Plus they lie offering 75% discount. | This is one of the most user friendly hotel booking app I have ever used. Pretty budget friendly booking too. | wow the best app | good app | Good site but dependant on price from other sites + or -. I don't know why when it's a hostel site it has expensive hotels and some hostels above other site prices!? | muy Bien | great app to book | Pretty good, seems cheaper than others? | incredible app, works around the world | Broken app and website. The production URL for logging in seems failing everywhere. Unable to login during crucial time during VISA process | Everything is easy and flawless | great plate-forme | tight af | Does not work as expected. Uninstalling, moving on. | easy to use and love the layout/aesthetic! | grate app. .you get tips and honest feed back from people who where actually there. not the company painting a facility that's probably not honest about the .accommodation. don't get me wrong some people give bad reviews on some stuff. that's its kinda pity. but this app helps a ton.! I been using it for years! cheers and safe travels. | easy to use. reviews are very informative. respects privacy by not sending spam email. | Nice Application | It's Nice. | easy | Very good app | does not list all available properties in the area | Plenty of options for accomodation. üòÉ | My favorite resource for finding truthful reviews on hostels. | When I used this app previously, meaning years ago, I would reserve a room or a bed somewhere, pay 15 or 20% of the total price of my stay and then pay the rest when I finally arrived at the hostel. This seems to have changed. I just reserved a bed in Vienna, I was charged a part of the total price as usual but then the rest was charged from my credit card the next day. If that's the way this service works now, then I have no use for it. | I've had a glitch happen where the selected dates shift by one day after I press search. | Nice app , made my trips cheap , I had the opportunity to know new people explore different cultures without paying crazy moneys on hotels. What could be done to make this app a better experience ? Plan to disactive memberships on of some of the hostels that has constant bad reviews over the years . some hostels become not available because they have been filled with long term living people , I hope you can find a way to mention this in your app . | Why did this app never show up on my recent apps? Very annoying | Best deal for short stay | Account password reset emails are not being sent to all email providers and customer care is useless. | very helpful | I can't get help to fix a extra debit in my account | good | Worst customer service ever, I wanted to get the information for the booking, The agent named with Hevandro disconnected my chat 3 times by saying all the best. I have chat transcript. It was really unprofessional and first and last experience with Hostelworld. | DO NOT BOOK THROUGH HOSTELWORLD. This company allowed us to book a hostel that they no longer worked with so when we showed up late at night the hostel has no recognition of our booking. The booking was showing in the app under upcoming trips until a few hours before where it disappeared in the app to the cancelled bookings which neither us or the hostel cancelled. We are now over ¬£800 out of pocket and trying to get in touch with someone from Hostelworld is near impossible. | not trustable, only works when they felt fine to do it | We're going o | No ability to give negative reviews to places, i got scamed by a place they charged me full price after i canceled 1 month in advance even though the policy says you can cancel 1 week earlier and they only charge the reservation fee | somany hidden charges | My experience with using Hostelworld has been great. Both the hostels I stayed at were really nice places and a highlight of my mumbai trip. | Great app to find hostels buuuut many of the reviews for the properties are fake. 5 stars of they could verify the reviews that are genuine. | Used to be good but now full of scammy bot reviews, also another loop hole where the host can cancel your booking once you have got there and paid so you are unable to leave a legitimate review. A real shame cause this used to be good, never again hostelworld been burnt too many times now. | Will NOT help in the case of their own app preventing cancellation. You must reach out to the accomodation on your own | Amazing Service! | Avoid, complete scam. | I have been charged twice for same booking. I already sent email to both hostel andnhostelworld.. unfortunately, i m not getting any reply and for irony hostelworld says query solved.... Very unfortunate and pathetic... Intersting there are hidden charges by hostelworld around 20 euros. Which were no where mentioned during booking | We are living our second youth. we are a bit older and have had nothing but great luck with Hoatelworld | Terrible application. Cannot find any cities unless it is the capital or a popular tourist destination. It has very few hostels compared to reality which limits a lot the choices you have if you don't look elsewhere. | trip I book do show up can use half the things this app promises | very very good | Sometimes the price is not the best one, but is useful | The only good thing about this app is the in-app chat group. But many times it doesn't work or allowing users to access the group | This site/app only accepts international transactions. it doesn't accept Indian currency | The customer service of Hostelworld seems to be unreachable. I wanted to create an account to cancel my booking and that didn't work. Tried reaching out via mail but haven't received a reply in 5 days. | Double price on arrival. I booked online and the price showed $29 dollars cad including taxes. I sat on a bus for 6 hours with no air conditioning finally got to the hostel at night and after going through all the check in procedures they let me know the taxes added up to an additional $20 dollars! This app was good but apparently it's a scam now. I talked to the hostel and they said oh it's in the fine print. Also the room was literally just big enough for the bed. 100% garbage | The site is easy to navigate, back up and restart | google reviews dont match up with reviews on website | I've installed the app but I'm unable to login, whenever I click on the login options nothing is happening, the continue with email button option is unclickable | The customer service is very unrealible once you actually have an issue with a booking. | What should I think? | Great for booking fast and reliable | No way to contact Customer support, no help provided in the event property cancells your booking. | app is super simple and easy to use | amazing app for backpackers and budget travelers they've never steered me wrong! | Best hostel booking app | Being able to search hostels would be better, rather than having to search location > dates > guests. sometimes you are given a recommendation for a place and just want to check it out | Used for years, always great! Love the interface. | Hostelworld is an absolute gem for solo travellers. It's so easy to get in touch with other people going to the same place as you and meeting new people. | easy to use and good hostels | Poor app | nice | Doesn't seem to work at all. Doesn't allow me to log in and wherever I search on whatever date it says \"0 properties found\" | They cancelled my trip without a notice, no answer from the support. I was already charged. I dont even know what to do and my trip is in two days. It's been a disaster because I can't even open the app anymore. It gives me an error | Horrible Experience | The serach engine is not working. I cannot find most places. | Sir please help me out I am having login problem | I use this app all over Europe and North america | Been an amazing asset on my interrail adventure! | Loveeee this app | I booked multiple hostels but it keeps only showing one hostel. Also when I click the link in the email of the next hostel I booked. This is very anointing, becaus eI wnat to cancel my second booking.

I absolutely love this app and use it whenever I solo travel. Heck, some of these places, I'd even have a friend book their own stay with me! So worth it for socialization. You just have to do your research on the hostels themselves because hostelworld essentially is creating a search engine and a profile that allows you to connect with hostels around you!","I used to love this app, but it just updated and seems to have gotten rid of all the features I loved the most. You can no longer save favorites or make lists of hostels which is SO frustrating. Also, you used to be able to click the location and read written directions on how to get to the hostel from the owners before you book. It was so helpful seeing thos instructions before booking, not just having Google maps.","They absolutely need to bring back the ability to create lists and save favorites. This is how I plan my trips ahead of time, and I've actually lost a ton of my research for a trip I've got coming up next week. I have no idea why they would have removed this. You also can't see a map of locations anymore, so it's fairly useless to try and book a decent location without having something else open to check every single one. I'll be using a different app until they fix this.","Used to be a big fan of this app, but suddenly all my lists for planning upcoming trips are gone--i had spent hours reviewing properties & bookmarking the best places. Just gone & I need to book in the next few days! SO FRUSTRATING! Can no longer view any of the properties I've stayed at previously or even the cities or countries. Clearly didn't care at all about the user's needs when designing this garbage update. I dont have any reason to use this app anymore. I'll look for something else.","I used to love this app and used it consistently for travel throughout 2019 and beyond till now. They recently did an overhaul of the app design and they took away Favoriting and having lists of hostels of the ones you favorited. It now makes it so much more difficult to keep track of the ones you want to stay in, the ones you liked when reading descriptions, and harder to narrow down where to stay when you can't click the simple heart to favorite a hostel and see it when scrolling through."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.hostelworld.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hostelworld.app&hl=en&gl=us"}

Try it! | Super app to keep track of your travels. | Absolutely great for seeing what loved ones are up to and where they are. | Been great to follow the journey of friends. | Absolutely brilliant | Love following my daughter's trip this way! | So far, l have only followed my daughter, but it is great to see the different places | Seems great so far | It is a realy nice app to let your friends and family have part of your travels, without needing to call them every day:) | Nice way to follow friends. | A vivid and visual way to describe your trip to others. | Lovely interface to follow people on their travels | Great app to catalog experiences throughout a trip - and to share them with others. | Love this program!! I order a hard bound copy of all of my adventures to keep my memories in one place. Use this whenever i travel. The new guide feature is handy for finding things to do too! | Can't rate this app highly enough. Our son is travelling across east Asia and friends and family have been able to share in his travels through photos and regular updates. It's a lovely and non intrusive way to keep in touch and will act as a lovely final travel blog. | Love this app, I'm using it for travelling at the moment but I really wish there was an option to caption photos individually! | Beautiful app, really useful both for private tracking or sharing or public sharing. Tr√®s belle application, excellent pour partager son voyage en images et videos. Peut partager publiquement ou de fa√ßon semi priv√© ou simplement garder son historique de voyage. | My go to whenever I travel , its one of my favourite apps | Amazing app, can't believe how brilliant it is, wish I'd heard of it years ago. Brilliant record of our trip to South Africa from Scotland. | An excellent app to track your trips and letting your friends and family be part of the journey. It's great that you can share locations, photos and favorite spots. Would be amazing to be able to create a shared trip with the person you're travelling with so both travellers can upload pictures, etc. üëç | Nice app for keeping track while traveling. I wish there was an option to add captions for specific phptos. Also, a possibility to edit and write descriptions on the laptop and justbon the phone/tracking device. | It took a bit to work it out but now I am very happy with Polarsteps and so are my non face book friends. | Very good app! | Love the idea but the app is not intuitive. I've been trying to add the location to the trips and still have no clue! | Great way to let friends and family track your travels | Great app family can see we're we have been. | Great app, amazing for planning my trips with the guides and keeping my memories alive! | Following my friends' World cruise and this app has been amazing and kept me up to date daily as my friends post their experiences. | We are using this app now for over 5 years and we love it. The collection of our Polarsteps travel books is increasing. One of the things we love most is the way it shows where you have been during and after your trip, both in the app and in the book. | Perfect to record your travels! | First thing it did was demanding me to create an account without first telling what the app can do for me. Many apps do need your info so they can pester you with advertising emails. Uninstalled immediately. | It's a really good way to capture and share travel experiences. The editing is a bit primitive, with the screen leaping about, but otherwise 5*. | Brilliant | Great app for documenting your travels and keeping memories, and allowing others to follow and share. | Great | A very easy app to use.So lovely to follow your love ones on their travels. I've got all the family using it, even the Seniors have the hang of it.. | Nice idea, doesn't allow u to update photos if the dates are not current. And every 15 second it notifies me that I need to share my contacts ... Not ver intutive and the UX is poor | Super concept | Easy to follow friends and family on their trip | Love it ,fantastic | We have been able to follow our son and his girlfriend's amazing journey and see their photos along the way. It really helps to keep up with their travels! | Great for keeping the family informed. | I am using this app on my open end world trip and highly recommend it! | Great app to use for documenting travels, just what I was looking for! | Great way to stay intouch | I really like this application because it allows me to have track of all my trips as long as add photos and descriptik of places visited. Great plus that it works offline and share to social networks is easy. | This app is exceptional, it's so nice to see where friends and family are visiting in the world and to correspond with them in real time. | Poor menu navigation design. Every time I scroll through foto's in a step and I go a millimeter up or down instead of left or right and the foto's drop away and because of the menu design I have to scroll through all the foto's again and it will happen again and again. Please fix the UI! I did find out later I can mitigate the problem by scrolling through photos fullscreen. Otherwise I think it's a good app, | Great app. Recommended to friends and family | Love this app, family can follow and share our holiday. | Polarsteps, my travel companion! What an amazing app!! In the future you could add features to the travel stats like number of unesco world heritage sites visited and more. There's a lot of potential in this app. | I love this place that allows me to track my steps as i travel | Used it since 2022 and recorded about 5 trips. 10 days self drive round Iceland: On a cruise ship across the Atlantic; Cruise ship to Antarctica etc. To save data, you can post a few photos to mark the location first and upload more later. | Excellent | Until now, I am satisfied with the App. But I should say it's not easy at the beginning to understand how it works. | Excellent app | I've used the app for several years now and its functionality has improved in that time. I use it as a travel diary to track where I've been and share stories with friends. Unhappily very few of my friends use it. It's a great alternative to FB for those who want to share or track travel info. | Fantastic way of following daughter's big trip | Works well and lovely to keep up with friends and family on their trips | I am enjoying Polarsteps üòâ | It's lit | My daughter is using Polarsteps to post about her travels and it is a great way for her to keep a record while also updating friends and family. | Some additional formatting options would be cool, bit it's clean, intuitive and no ads! | Love this app, it helped me keep track of where we'd been and what we'd seen. So nice to see it displayed on a map too. The only thing that I'd change is when you press into a step, you have to swipe to see your photos, meaning it can be hard to find a specific one if you take a lot of photos in one place. It would be better in my opinion if they displayed down the page so you can simply scroll to see everything. | This is a great way to keep intouch with your friends. Instead of independent. | Awesome app, we used it for our journey across Asia. Easy for family and friends to keep up to date. Can't believe it's free ! Only issue is that you can reply to people's comments individually, which would be a good feature to add. | good up to write a trip story | I have used this app for years. Not only can you look back at memories and quickly view photos, dates and locations, you can order an already made photo book. | Nice apps. | Love that I can map and chronicle my trips and share it with family and friends | Easy to use, possible to use more then one phone with same account | Keeping it up as we travel on our long NZ trip is more than writing a diary. Those that want to can follow us. Looking forward to making a book. | Good to excellent. Still trying to understand how to make sure tracking does not have gaps. | Great app to track your travels and let your followers know what you,ve been up to | Overall great app! I'm always keen on using it! Here are some ideas that would make the experience even better: 1) improve location search (it doesn't find much) and allow moving the point after 2) private notes in each step, regardless of the whole trip visibility 3) overall notes for the whole trip 4) ability to crop/zoom/rotate images in steps 5) ability to exlucde countries from a trip (layover at an airport doesn't really count as visiting the country) 6) a presentation mode in the web app | Keeping up with the travels of friends and relatives whenever they post. Not for the public. | So slick looking ! Easy enough to navigate once my 54 year old brain had figured it out! My followers love it to. Far better thzn having a massive whatsapp group | Works well each time & every time. | Great way to record your trip | The app is so easy to use, which I love. You can add pictures and videos to each step that you add so you can go back and look at what you did in each area. It's also a great way for family and friends to know what you are doing on your trip. The best bit is that you can make a travel book at the end, which may seem a bit pricey, but seeing as the app itself is free to use, I think it is a good price for what you get. | Fantastic app that functions as intended. I enjoy recommending it to others. | This is a fun app for people who travel. It's a great way to organize travel photos on the go. Followers can receive notifications and make comments on your trip. I do wish the comments would attach to the photo rather than the \"step\" but, that's not a major issue. | Great. | Such an awesum app to view. Following my nephew n his whanaus trip round NZ | Good. Just hard to select dates sometimes. | I really like this app but please I beg you: add an auto save feature. It's really frustrating to start writing my step description from the beginning again just because I got distracted and came back too late, which happens a lot when you're on a trip! I know the save draft feature exists but it's too easy to forget. As an Android dev myself I know you can implement Activity restoration at least, and incremental auto save locally and server side should be a top priority! I'll give 5‚≠ê then! | Excellent idea, excellent app! Allows me to \"remotely\" travel with people I know (or sometimes don't know). Great way to see hidden corners of the world :) | Love this app. It allows for family to keep in touch, it is easy to use & provides a great record of your holidays. | Fun way to share stuff with friends and family, and also good to look back on! Easy in use! | Fantastic app, easy and fun to use. | Great app. Still using the app 5 years later. A wonderful way of documentingy travels, keeping in touch with friends and creating a great memory. Only sorry I can't locate my 2018/19 trip. | Love this app!! Great way to update a lot of people at the same time about your travels. My friends and family absolutely love it!! | Like traveling along, great! | Fantastic app for logging trips and journeys. Easy to use and share | 4.5 would be pretty accurate, overal great app that let's you share your adventures, and keep track of them for yourself. There are definitely some optimizations to be made, like how to upload pictures which aren't made with your phone. Edit for clarity: you can upload pictures from other folders/albums, it's just more tedious to do so. The app sometimes rejects one of the pictures (maybe a format issue?) and then it fails to upload all selected pictures. Then the user needs to upload the 1by1 | Love, love, love! The only thing I wish this app did differently, is I wish I could add captions to each photo instead of only one caption per step. Otherwise, it's a really cool way to build a memoir of our trip and share it in real-time with friends and family! | Great way of sharing a trip with friends and family in one place. | Great app, however it's auto added a stop in the middle of the Atlantic ocean I never went to that I can't delete. Whenever I go to edit step, it says 'could not load api'. | Excellent way to follow our family on their travels | On the whole this app has done me proud, but it's unpredictable. When I've diminished it to check a fact, everything I've written has disappeared when I pull it up again. Sometimes it won't let me continue editing and only offers Publish. I've had to reload photos on a number of occasions. Telling me what was on my bucket list was unnecessarily intrusive. In summary, when the app works it's very good indeed and my followers are delighted but software issues still need more work perhaps. | Great way to capture travel memories. Printed albums are easily generated and are a memory for years! | Fun, easy to use and fantastic for all travellers :) | Fantastic way to track and share our travels with friends and family | Best app for journaling your travels on the go. The guides are also really handy for inspiration on what to See, where to Stay and Eat. Super easy to share a web link to friends and family | My favourite travel blog app! | 4.5 stars - app is intuitive to use and provides nice platform to upload pictures / videos and add a little description. Super easy to share with friends & family so they can like & comment. Only suggestion I'd like to see as improvement: for travelling between two locations I'd love to set or adjust the transportation used | Great app and so easy to use. Love the map it produces and the longitude and latitude markings. Family and friends love to follow our travels, and you have the added bonus of a travel book to purchase if you wish. Personally, it's a great aid to my photo album journalling later | Superb | This is a fabulous place to keep track of your trips and share your journey with friends and family. | great way to update close ones on a travelling journey, and very good UI when it comes to making 'steps'. I would only add some 'flexibility'. When swiping through photos of one step, a strong swipe makes it that you go to the next step and therefore skip video/photos unintentionally. | The best app for keeping friends and family updates on your travels. Beautiful UI, super easy to use and doesn't destroy your battery life like some trackers. | Polarsteps is a great way to keep track of one's trip and for friends and family to follow | I found the interface initially confusing as I am using both my phone and tablet for content. I got the hang of it after a couple of goes! You can always edit and republish! | Very fun way of keeping on track with my travelling friends. | Travel with friends and family with Polarsteps | Quel bonheur de suivre et d'√™tre suivi par la famille et les amis !

I would love it if pictures could be placed on maps automatically (from the photo meta data) - strava has been doing that for years! I'd really like to add past trips, especially backpacking trips, for which I didn't have my phone on, but it's too much work to do it manually.","i love this app! couple thoughts:. it would be great if you added a feature to drop a \"waypoint\". it's not actually a step that you document but it does you to more accurately Mark a path. the second option would be to make points on the journey moveable. sometimes the app puts a point thats not accurate. would love the oportunuty to move it.","Awesome! Helps organize where you are going step by step and how you get there.(DRIVE/FLY/BUS/COMBO)You also get a base price on gas&mileage. The Maps are really helpful, Though I still had to use Google maps for more detailed route information. It would be really cool to add a toll calculator as well as a tool to calculate food cost. Another cool feature is the app does a count down till you leave and tracks your progress as you go, grouping pics each day. So it's cool if you go off route."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.polarsteps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polarsteps&hl=en&gl=us"}

Things you actually need the app for (boarding pass, WiFi settings, etc.) are not readily available from the home screen and you have to swipe up on a not-so-intuitive menu slider to access them. | Doesn't update, locks up, hard to find what you want to do, look at or change | I checked in to my flight. But the app won't show me my boarding pass. I was able to sort this out by resetting my password, uninstalling and reinstalling the app. No idea how that happened or if it will happen again. Very unsettling. | Cool app to use when searching for airfares. | Everything was awesome can't wait to book my next adventure | overall very useful- not great for online checkin depending on circumstances | American airlines cancelled my paid reservations, didn't give me a refund, left me stranded, and said sorry | It was great. | If I could rate it 0, I would. Doesn't save information for my trip,Doesn't let me check in for flight. Asks you to install Verfly app which is even worse and didn't communicate with the AA app. Person on chat told me there's a\" glitch\" I T is working on,but IT WIRKED FOR EVERYONE ELSE ON THIS TRIP. No more AA or this stupid app in the future | So extremely slow to load and update. I had flight delays and tried using the \"manage trip\" and it just keeps spinning, but I can log onto the website and everything loads quickly! | Won't display boarding passes. Kind of removes benefit of having an app if I still need to go to a counter to get it printed out. It's like the most important function of this app and it fails. If it can only do one thing, it should be displaying boarding passes. How can you mess up the most important job? Happened to another individual here and they missed their plane. Do better. | Can never connect to internet | Website doesn't have text chat support so i got the app and didnt want to sign in all over again since im just helping a family member. Its demanding i fill in some guest form instead of just letting me talk to someone and directly fix my problem smh. The website is also badly made, if you bought elsewhere you cant search for your trip/add it to the account if you are signed in already lmao. Feel free to hire me for feed back guys, idk who tested this stuff for ya. | App won't let me check in for my flight | Will not load boarding pass when need | poor service in first class. not worth the upcharge. | Sucks and very slow | View boarding passes selection does not work. | can be flakey with showing the boarding pass | awful airline separates families and took 40 minutes to deliver our bags | easy booking. on time, clean, offers none stop flights. friendly staff, very helpful customer service. safe, comfortable, reliable. care given to luggage and personal items. | Never has my flight info in the app even though I'm logged in. Never get flight points either. App seems useless. | on-time and exceptional customer service! | ok flight | app is horrible for anything but boarding passes | Of all the greats times | Staff made me download the app when I could have found the info online or he could have helped me track the bags. | Unable to navigate through, freezes up | Boarding pass didn't work right when I was ready to get on plane. Would not let me check in on the way home. | Love that I was able to watch Deadpoolü§ó | Flight attendants should check all carry-on compartments and tell passengers to remove small bags so that they don't take the space of carry-on. | So far so good, I mean if course there could be better UI decisions, but it's usable | great and easy app | Not user friendly | I think American Airlines may be the only commercial carrier that actually focuses on the average flyer. | So convenient to check in and check on your points from this app | This app worked great on my Motoz4 phone and then they updated it on 3/1/24. Now it isn't compatible. Time to fly another airline | it works | Always perfer American | Your seats are way too narrow. The passenger compartment was kept like an icebox, making it very uncomfortable. | Never works. Told me I checked in successfully, but when I arrived at the gate, I was told I would have to wait 5 HOURS for the next flight. Consistently buggy, boarding passes are wrong or never appear, overall the worst airliner app out there. | I cant ever view ny boarding passes, so I have to go to check in at the airline. Even though I check in on my phone. | March 2024. My phone is an Android phone and this app it doesn't properly. I can't find my flights or request my miles. Please fix it | Keep you updated, all your flight details | On time and overall good experience | DO NOT CHECK IN VIA APP (the app will not actually check you in. It doesn't matter if you click the link from the email they sent you. It doesn't matter if you try to check in by entering your details through the app. It WILL NOT go through and you will be stopped from boarding your flight. Garbage app) | easy, efficient....had to change a seat...it took seconds. | Worst Airline App, Ever. | Excellent crew, smooth ride to Dallas. Very comfortable, newer plane. I do wish planes still had a bit more legroom and wider seats not so close to other travelers, but this was better ride than last couple I've flown. American's app worked great, too. | Missing miles, consistently doesn't add my miles from flights. Very poorly designed. Annoying ads and pop ups asking me for access to my phone. | Tickets won't load, app is slow, and even after trying to contact they said they would look into it within 7 days. Not very useful when my flights this week. | Great service and on time flights internationally and locally, recently. | Excelente | Glitches often, wont process changes, wont display boarding passes when it should. Requires a new check in everytime you open it, even if you've previously checked in for your flight. I also once had it display that my flight was cancelled when it wasnt. Just a bad experience all around. The other airline apps I use dont seem to have these problems. | Two weeks of travel on android app, multiple updates, not once would the boarding passes load/display. Could not change flights through the app, desk said they could not longer do it and it had to be through the app. Flights would show but then error out when trying to select an alternate | Funky town/ funky App / funky monky | App can't store food selections nor do they properly process your TSA pre-check. Pass on American Airlines | Loved being able to have up to date flight info. | S√∫per | Sometimes it won't allow you to pull up your boarding pass, which is the main reason I have the app. Frustrating. | great app, easy to use | Prices are not accurately represented in the app and it's impossible to get a fare difference refund for the exact same flights even when the cost of the flights was cut by over a half. | \"This review must have taken flight.\" | Bad | This app is pretty good for most things like booking flights, checking statuses, getting alerts. Unfortunately, it's nearly unusable when trying to change flights. It's a nonzero chance that trying to change your flight will cancel your entire reservation with no notice or refund. Best case scenario is it takes you 10 tries to make a change. Hopefully they make some improvements. | very slow getting bags out! | good app | American Airlines needs to do some better training with their employees. Seems tho many gate attends can be very unsupportive of the customers. They don't manage the carryon/customer ratio well. They seem to always make me check it because they are too full. This has caused so many delays for people. And American seems to care less. | This app is horrible, login, and access denied! Change password, access denied. Change flight, access denied. Like WTH! You see me, see my flights, but can't seem to find me when logging in. Worst experience ever! | Great flight, Great movies! | Great seats, even in the low budget section | Hard to use and freezes up Like to eliminate customer service representative | Manage trip ability has been broken for DAYS. Says changes lost you must start over - 5 times now! | Doesn't let you buy extra bags after checking in. Seems like they don't want to sell more. | American will get sued for the extorsion they are currently engaged in with respect to intentionally separating families that do not pay a \"seat fee\". | Your app is terrible. I have to switch app to app to get anything done. It's really bad, on top of that, checking in requires multiple clicks and page jumps. Your app designer needs to be fired and you guys need to start over. (It's really bad) | on time flights, comfortable seats, helpful crews and very good service. | It was ok I was just trying to watch the free movies but I think I fell asleep B4 they came on one time | Very intuitive! | Can't check in. Tabs do not work when you click on them. Website redirects to mobile app, so I can't check in. | Very good service. Thanks | My seat was broken. The canvas straps wore out, and so my seat cushion sunk through causing me to have to \"sit on a bar\" for 2.5 hours. | This is by far the worst airline app to ever exist. It is likely it will always be the worst airline app in existence. Far into the future, I'm certain this will still be the worst airline app ever. | üëç | Absolutely horrible. Just as buggy and horrendous as the airline itself | Unable to check in due to errors with the contact tracing page, and no offline mode | Hideous experience. ‚ñ™Ô∏éTrip/Flight credit doesn't work! ‚ñ™Ô∏éGrayed-out (unable to change) wrong gender. ‚ñ™Ô∏éCostly mistakes due to incessant, annoying, and distracting UPSELLING clutter and pop-ups. ‚ñ™Ô∏éLoses information, so start over. NO customer service. It's a really hideous experience! | Android version does not have a Push Notifications settings area like the IOS version. So the app will not tell you it's time to check in for your flight, which is a major miss. | 3-MAR-2024 - - - Please try again later. We are unable to retrieve your boarding passes. - FOUR HOURS LATER > no change. 19-Jun-2019 - - - Once again boarding passes will not load. | App will not add/change information on Information and Password page. This REALLY sucks. | The boarding passes will not load on app...keeps saying unable to retrieve | Didn't update at all. I didn't know my wife flight got redirected to a different airport until I got to our airport. | I think a passenger should be informed before their seat is change. I had plans on taking pictures for my social media through the window and I was replaced with another customer who needed help obviously when the mind but the fact that I wasn't asked first was very disappointing | Sucks, don't work well, won't open | Terrible app just like the airlines. Nearly missed the flight as it notified me of the wrong gate. Also the Boarding pass has somehow disappeared now. Lucky I have a print out! | customer service is the worths | Attempted to download. apparently can only be doenloaded to phone which I dont need. Waste of time for a BRAND NEW laptop | Sitting in the plane, breathing jet fuel exhaust...waiting to leave and the app won't work. Sucks | Different than the iPhone app!, why? | The flights were on time. | Had to re-enter information twice due to an error on the app. | it is a wonderful app | Love American | Great | Not great, standard features missing. Can't even see tickets you bought for others. Very unintuitive overall. Can't search for airports nearby (you can on the web, WTH?). Really poor app. | App crashes | Please Do better. Instead of all the annoying pop-ups and non intuitive layout, make it easier to access user profile, make changes. Auto add TSA pre check to ALL boarding passes automatically when you have an up-to-date KTN in the app. Make the chat bot actually function like a helpful human instead of just being a waste of time. In short, be less terrible. | Honestly trash if you are flying an American itinerary and don't use an AA FF #. Won't let you check in, won't show gate info, nothing. Penalizing you for being a Oneworld member on a partner airline vs American. But, is in keeping with American Airlines' subpar service in most other regards. | Won't bring let me enter known traveller number | Beware - gate information doesn't update. Why have an app that's connected to the Internet that doesn't update? Come on AA - you can do better. | I have never been able to get the passport scanner thing to work. Tried all kinds of lighting or lack of lighting to get rid of the glare and it still won't read it. Never had this problem with other airlines apps. | one inoperable toilet upon departure for a full flight lasting 8 hours. Not acceptable. | Not able to complete registration and/or add credit card | I will invoice you my $5,000/ hour rate for any comment. Simply send check in mail and estimate two hours of my time totalling $10,000.00 for my comments. Please remit by 12:00 Hrs., 01Mar24. | horrible customer service from Khyma the gate agent | Want install | BE AWARE! POLICIES HAVE CHANGED. AA CAN NOW CANCEL UR TICKETS WITH NO REFUND OR EXCHANGE! STUCK IN ST. THOMAS! | Perfect for tracking airline travel. | Ground support in Richmond, VA (RIC) is horrible. our flight 983 arrived at 11:45 pm. We waited for 12 minutes to be marshalled in. We parked at the gate at midnight. it is now 12:27 am and the first bag still has not come through baggage claim. This is not an isolated incident. It has happened in the past. This is the worst service! | It doesn't seem to work | I cannot Check in of get my boarding pass. The Delta app is 1000x better and works every time! | All good | I put in a correct username and password and it does not log me in. | very helpful app | flight was great. thank you | Update 6 years later: still no wallet boarding passes. Do you even have an android team? Update: 4 years later, still cannot add boarding passes to Google wallet. Cannot add the boarding passes to the new google pay app. Now with the latest ux design, you cannot use the app. Who even designed this app? They have put all custom interactions and one thing that is only required for the app to do (boarding pass) is not supported. | Super easy app to use for all your needs. Excellent Custoer Service too. | great flight, but I was disappointed that my seat wasn't upgraded when there were 18 standbys. as an AAMember I feel members would get some preference. 35B and I know other passengers were given preferential seating. | It's good | app is slow and today I was unable to pull up my boarding passes | I really hate that miles expire. My least favorite thing about American Airlines. | terrible service and horrible customers service | Very temperamental app. Trying to use it while traveling is almost impossible. | app is purposely difficult to use | Perfect flight and great service today! | works well, getting better | Easy to use! | great flights with awesome flight Crews | In order to do anything in this app they redirect you to download other apps, and before you know it you've got an arsenal of apps for just one flight... I'm not doing that. | App acts like it will open but it just stays on screen with beach | Hit our miss on being able to add baggage, or even see your boarding pass. Have had to step out of line to have it printed because the app was not working properly. I don't know how there can be problems with those app for so long! | Working well. Need to add option to add boarding pass to wallet | great flight crew. best trip this year..thank you | Have been waiting more 30 minutes for bags for flight 2345 in Cincinnati. The thing has not moved even yet! Unacceptable | great landing great pilot information for baggage not clear to where it's at with it having to ask every worker | Getting through. Trying to get my password. | the app works great for AA. I like the updates and the airport maps, I can book flights, update, change, and monitor all from the app. track status and rewards. baggage, it's very good. I wish that partner, one world airlines showed better in the app for baggage and boarding passes. but overall good. | It can never find my locator number when im on standby always need to check in with gate agent | Tried to install about 10x. Too frustrating. It just isn't going to happen.","histogram":{"1":4098,"2":1221,"3":1856,"4":6556,"5":60383},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":false,"androidVersion":"8.0","androidVersionText":"8.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"American Airlines, Inc.","developerId":"American+Airlines,+Inc.","developerEmail":"aa.mobile@aa.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.aa.com/app","privacyPolicy":"https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/privacy-policy.jsp","developerInternalID":"American+Airlines,+Inc.","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Fv8XHfieFcN6A0QgXH68DjdowRHqagzndBt6DpfJtW1UBJktfCYHx7jiU5dVuFSVXrM","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kRsyQtihqRC1OhSaDAb6sMmKc3yK1BA_5u38dCWH8ryNfGilEiZ0Iaw-8upktSFigSU","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9hB77E9dkg3WykmH1iPSGUgHbFLbHxJDTbnhoDe90olr07OaWNIwxTTZl0YX6gaS8QY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PsyzX8EevUtn3zV3IgCc2szMl5xQTZcoUMaSqYONuWwAlZFbVNCfN_S5WrIoCNvjNw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZuWzPtYuQzeT7jvxx4YX-NYBPlW974vjAC2lmp0bkKEONxb-Nl9jEPdlWdW4Znz2Ww","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cJIMApUaDeZ277OOwwcLuQ6KOJ-QjdQMC9ru6UqXwX_kERa4ICwPdqiXWWDl9Lw8obo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-94toZekAuZXiQbVY5heawanOssQUb7Hrx7th9De66hrnF9IjLxjQBWy7xP3WUQrD_U","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Jor6p06p1xYuPpCOFtaH1oPDWy3o0sK841a-XViN01PlfeUZaLnNai9QsO3A0yzQc08","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mjyfKXM0csgtsC3nl2r9lI6-KR3bMGe15YOY6CqDhFsXGQQI4-m5qPOQGf63qtES_4g"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Feb 7, 2011","updated":1710537514000,"version":"2024.9","recentChanges":"We‚Äôre continuing to work behind the scenes to improve your app experience","comments":["This app is pretty good for most things like booking flights, checking statuses, getting alerts.

In the time of being mobile and always on the go, I expect to be able to also answer questions from others in a timely manner without having to get to a computer. | Be very careful making a reservation. The app gave an error and said to choose a different location because the 1 i chose wasn't available. So i chose a new one, and then i got charged for both. Neither reservation wants to allow me to get a refund. | Downloaded it because I hear 7 ads for it per hour on pandora. It immediately tried to get me to download 3 other travel apps. Also they have a rental fee, plus host fee, plus taxes, plus service fee. Wouldn't be surprised to see a fee management fee added soon. | I have used VRBO several times and have been very pleased with every trip we have booked. I highly recommend it! | App has a menu to show you your upcoming trips. Unfortunately, your upcoming trips are not listed in this menu. Also, once you've made a booking, you can't see that property again. There's a button to see property details, but you can't see the listing of the property anymore. | App sucks. Can't search by property ID. | Filters aren't accurate Private pool should not include community pool. Pictures load slowly | love this app | Renter had not mentioned in the listing the pools were under construction. When the seller let me know the pools were closed I cancelled the reservation with in hours of making it. Vrbo couldn't/wouldn't refund 100 percent of my booking despite that being their STATED policy. Do not ever use vrbo. Terrible customer service. I was disconnected several times. I had to call the insurance company they use to try and get my money back. Zero stars | \"Something went wrong\" top many times | Worst experience with this app. It was fine before but since the recent merger I have issues every time I use this app. Recently wanted to send message to host and it tells me I can not do it at this moment... have tried for 3 days with same result. Also wanted to cancel a reservation and it tells me to sign in by the way I am signed in!!!!! Terrible get your acr together oh and by the way also one of my recent bookings never showed in the app!!! | Used to be able to switch from customer to owner but that's not an option now. | Not trustworthy listings amenities are inaccurate | All of sudden inbox doesn't work. Can't see messages host the sent. Can someone fix this because going to be a problem not being able to communicate with host | Sign-in is not working anymore | Not user friendly for listings. | Have always managed my rental listings from a laptop but for grins I decided to download the app & give it a try. What a joke! No place for owners to even access listings except to first go to help center & try multiple links to find a \"back door\" into the owner dashboard. Then immediately kicked out of listing or dashboard if you try to backtrack even 1 page! Ridiculous mess of an app & to think how much of a percentage they take from both travelers and owners- Shameful. Uninstalling now. | Doesn't allow link to plug in property ID. Doesn't open link shared via text. Doesn't list upcoming trips. Not sure why I would keep this app at all.... don't care for One-Key. | Updated the app. Absolutely littered with issues, most pages don't function, unknown errors occurring all the place. It's like it hasn't been tested. The chat support disconnected 3 times in the space of 2 minutes. Absolutely shocking. Save yourselves the hassle and use another platform and different booking agent. | Sucks I can't get where I want to go | Can't change country and change Dollars into English pound!!! | Host canceled the day before my trip! | always find the perfect place and smooth transaction. | Links never work, only redirect me to the Appstore. Invite codes also never work. Should've spent less on youtube ads, more on developing the app to a functional point | Awesome app, easy to use, and great options to choose from. | so great üëç | Too invasive. Annoying notifications. Privacy control options. | Never works | great service thank you so much!!üòÄ | Like others I'm having issues at log in and general user friendliness. Incredible hard to get things to work. | Booked the stay, after which the host over doubled the price, saying it's a mistake on his side as the price was not up to date. Vrbo did nothing to deal with the scam. BE AWARE OF SCAM. The general message below they keep leaving to customers goes to tell you what you are dealing with. | Doesn't open links to places. | Under settings it will not let me display my phone ID. ( That info is in grey not black) | I have used this a couple times and I've never been disappointed | The app isn't showing pricing info after property is booked, it keeps logging off and asking for password. | the app and the website need a lot of work | My first choice | App is glitchy on my Android phone. Syncing between devices is poor when a trip is shared between multiple people. Update: Contacting tech support was unproductive. They didn't grasp the nature of my problem, pasted instructions that were irrelevant to my problem into the chat, and kept offering to reach out to hosts for the stays I've booked. I terminated the chat out of frustration when they suggested I find a different device to use to solve the glitch problem. | Bueno | Not always a good deal | Can not find owners page called support no help | terrible!!!!!!!!! | App no longer works. Can't log on to owner dashboard from my phone. | Links to listings won't open in the app, and I can't just look on the website even if I'm signed in (just reroutes to the app). | I've used this app for years. Now I cannot message property owners or update my email because it constantly wants me to login, but never let's me. This is extremely frustrating. Somehow it let me book a reservation and took money from my bank account but shows me I'm not logged in anywhere. | always find great cabins | Useless. Will not let me change my email account and so I can't find my booked and paid for holiday. | Buggy | App won't load messages. Says I'm offline | Love VRBO, hate the app. Android version is full of bugs when scrolling through your planned trips. Can't zoom out on Google map, and more issues. Strongly recommend solid QA regression on Andriod, until then, I'll be using the desktop version instead. | They took a perfectly good app and completely screwed it up. I'm logged into my account and EVERYTHING is wiped out. We have a trip booked and we can't even see that trip in the app. Based on other reviews it's been a problem for quite sometime and it appears VRBO has no interest or no knowledge of how to fix it. | good except you can't filter for distance which sucks | I was looking for a luxury villa as I do annually when taking 2 of my children and 4 of my grandchildren. This villa fit our needs & love that it has a private pool for our own enjoyment. 2023 I took my other 2 children and other 4 grandchildren to Maui. Worked with a private travel agent and my experience was horrible & never found out how or what our villa looked, she scheduled economy flights & didn't tell me that. My daughter scheduled the vehicle & was priced $200.00 cheaper than her | I love this app. Easy to use and book. | use this app every single time I go on vacation. love it!!!!! | love this site for Local options for Vacation stays! | I've used VRBO for years without issue. But this merge with Expedia has been a HUGE detriment to this site/app and has made the user experience ridiculously frustrating. Couple examples, won't save info so I have to enter log in info on the app every single use, my inbox routinely glitches out and I can't access messages, the map just won't load vs list ... literally every time I use the app something goes wrong. Such a shame. Used to be such a great platform. | I have used VRBO many times in the past and had really good experiences. However since they updated the app it really sucks. It's hard to get into. Can't find your saved stuff. Hard to search for places... Looking for other options. | they're a great and easy way to go | Love booking with VRBO! | Any. Mt m K.kb. M | super easy and convenient! | I'f you can use another app pleases do... the customer service is a joke, it very hard to talk to anyone. They are one step up from being a scam. | quick and easy booking service. no hidden charges. plenty of choice | exciting! | Support is just plain trash. They will not solve any issues at all. There is no follow up on the cases. They can't refund any money as they say this has to be done by the host. . Don't waste your time honestly | love it | Host cancelled my stay shortly before the trip (32 days to be exact) because they decided to rent the place to someone else. Vrbo \"support\" won't do anything beyond a basic refund because they will only give assistance if your host cancels within 30 days of the reservation. Prices have more than doubled on remaining available places and Vrbo will do absolutely nothing to help offset this. So much for their \"Book with Confidence Guarantee\". | You left the back door open, with your clirnts wisely exposed. I have no interest wit your mistakes, i√∑' look for a fafer venur J Bauer, past userno othanks | Recently reached out to a useless agent thru chat. Just to have her Everlyn F. check if a listing was legitimate. Real waste of time! | Constant permissions issues. Can't even check inbox even after signing in. Use the website instead. | Difficult to get help or access inbox for communications. Enter code sent to email to sign in, and it just goes back to the blank sign in. App wasn't this difficult to use when I first joined VRBO. Almost impossible to get booking canceled or modified through app. | a bit irritating and could do with some more tools, it's just not a very intuitive app. | Totally love this site. Makes planning trips so easy | App not working. Can't access trip boards, says \"Sorry, something went wrong on our end.\" | The fees are outrageous! | Won't let me update my email. I booked a trip and yet it doesn't pop up in my trips tab and it doesn't look like I have a way of finding my trip so I can add it. The app is so buggy and doesn't work. Not really making me want to use it a second time to be honest. | What the heck? Where are all my saved locations? All gone since the update. Why not just leave well enough alone? Geez!! | VRBO, OK I will try the need help in app. Thanks Update: \"Share\" booking to other app does not go to the booking. Uninstalling app. Map bug? Just noticed map only provides directions to the zip code of a reservation (no street), plus can't copy the address. Have to manually type into map app for directions. | It was very unprofessional. I booked a reservation for a house in Florida and was charged the vrbo fee and didn't provide the credit card information to the owner . A few days later, the owner canceled. When called and asked about they blame the owner and guess which is me that u didn't give my credit info to the owner when dealt with vrbo platform. Then I contacted the owner and was told that the house was available but at this time much high. Called again to vrbo and got run a round blam other | Very easy process. | Frustrating app. Different info and hard to find info on the app. Tried talking with Carmen on your help line. Been on for at least 15-20 min without getting answers and it disconnected me before she could give me an answer üò° | Tons of bugs since Expedia bought. Can't add notes to saved lists. Can't view saved lists on map. Notifications do nothing when clicked. Constant login requests that have dead buttons. It's bad. | use it every time. never been disappointed with a stay. easy to use | Not enough room to speak about all the BS we have had to endure our 1st time ever booking with any type of rental property. We have to move and we booked. The host canceled us stating we broke house rules. CS said that's impossible since we reported my daughter's ESA and hadn't even arrived yet. I rebooted same place and left a decent message. She let it go all the way to an hour ago and canceled us again! Said I spoke with her disrespectful last year and that VRBO said she should trust us LIES | We are planning a family vacation and I'm receiving listings to view. When I click on the link it goes to a screen to open in app and when I do it flashes and then nothing. I can not view the houses. I've un-installed the app twice thinking this was the issue. It was not. It would also be nice to copy the link and be able to paste it in the app. Very frustrating! | Can't open inbox messages | Like the options to determine my price, number of rooms and amenities. Simple to use. | Old app was great, new app is terrible. Harder to navigate, impossible to share info/links with others. Try again please. | The app works well, but it needs more filters especially one to only show pet friendly accommodation. | Easy to use. Fantastic choices. Quick service. Professional. Great app. Thank you!! | Much less easy to use since the One Key changes. No help from the Live Chat or FAQs. Disappointed. | Having issues using app. Maybe my own tech deficits but where are how to instructions? | Hassle free with payment options. I love it! | I had messages in my VRBO app from those I've rented from in the past. They are gone. When I log in, I get a \"something went wrong on our end\" message. This app used to work well. | very easy to use! | While this is not a review of the app it is a review of the VRBO company and their policies/ practices told guests. While I have used VRBO to book countless homes and vacations over the years and never encountered a problem, a recent experience has led me to permanently deleting my account with a plan to never use the site in the future. Based on my recent experience I would highly recommend users (especially guests) use caution when booking through VRBO or just use another travel website. | Dodgy transactions Booking a rental in Australia and paid the amount, that was displayed in Australian dollars, but was charged in US dollars from my account and incurred exchange fees. The help people agreed that website is designed to to people off. | One of the worst apps I've ever used | Don't trust this company. After giving them my info, we decided not to go to the beach. So i called back and canceled. At that point, i told them we canceled and not to take the money out of the bank. Got cancelation info. This was wensday evening. Friday this morning, they took out the money. I have emails showing transactions and cancelation. After 21 phone calls to the Philippines, i still have yet to speak to the higher-ups. Your info does go to third parties. Insurance + | Sign in loop. Trying to message the host back and I keep getting stuck in a sign in loop. | Not easy to use app. Don't even see billing history and invoices in my account. | great little vacay place finder | simple, easy to use app | Want money to update. Ridiculous | A hot tub is not a Jacuzzi tub/ jetted tub. Please stop claiming otherwise. This is very frustrating when searching for a rental. FYI hot tubs are located out doors. Jacuzzi/ jetted tubs are located in bathrooms. Smh | this exspearencie was amazing, my family had an absolute great time definitely get this app its really handy. üëåüòç | I don't like the update!!! Can't find anything and if I wanted access to Expedia, etc., I would have just gone to their site. You have ruined the VRBO site with this update!!!! üòû | The latest update destroyed this app on my Android phone. You cannot log in. And when you follow the help instructions, it is only written for apple users. In the US 42% of the population use Android phones. That is a significant customer base that you are ignoring. Fix the app and serve all your customers. | This app is terrible. It is so slow and sometimes never loads. Was looking for a abnb alternative, but it's not much good if the app doesn't work | I can't view or share pics of our vrbo vacation condo | Awful with no help. | This app is awful. It is more concerned with login security than being a place for a user to find booked reservations. So many ads and pop ups that it's unnerving. I Uninstalled and will stick to the web version. | easy use | My trips keep disappearing. I had to call to verify my trips were there as i have put down a lot of money. Now to review my trips to see when i have to pay the other portion. Guess what cant access trips again | Horrible Listed Stolen Abandoned villages that were not bought properties. Dangerous location that is stolen property. Listing is dangerous to my Service Animal Fur babies. Disrespecting their privacy, as well as mine with peping tom sniffing drug addict animalistic inhumane behavior with wiretapping. Dangerous for my PTSD, Seizure, Deaf/Blind Service /Animals Fur Babies. Too many animals without fur returning to me and my living being Fur babies. Trash all around on drugs attacking stalking. | Flooded with email ads I can't unsubscribe from. | This last update has caused issues with some features. It also doesn't always save changes. It continues to revert back to the original information. (Trip Boards) | I do not want to join OneKey and this app forces it. This will be the last time I book through vrbo. | Better than Hotels | Rubbish website. Can't enter my account. All you reviews say the same!!!!! | I do not recommend using VRBO or it's app any more. I rented with VRBO in Honolulu and it was the worst experience . Now you pay a huge \"service fee\" for nothing . We were without water for a day and as I write this the water is cold. Lost power to this unit also . Contacted the condo manager but he could do nothing. The only advantage of using VRBO is secure transactions and some coms Any problems with the rental unit you are on your own. VRBO did nothing. Impossible to reach the owner. | App and customer service were good. Just be sure to read the policies set by the properties. I booked a vacation property for coworkers and I to go to Vegas. After we looked into the location more, we found out that the property was not where we wanted to be based out of. Canceled within 30 hours of the booking and no refunded due to property cancelation policy. So now I am out $1500. | I was invited to a trip, I accepted and joined the trip, but on both the website and the app I was unable to view the listing where we would be staying. I had to call the trip organizer and have them send me a separate URL for the listing itself | I booked a trip last January of 2023, I canceled it within an hour because I booked another place. VRBO has yet to return their service fee of $106. Yeah I know it's not a whole lot of money but it sure took a whole lot of time to get nowhere with this company. I will not book again and I will not refer anyone to your company because I feel like you ripped me off. So much for your guarantee. Update: The host canceled reservation. This is on VRBO'S end. PASSED THE BUCK AGAIN!Emails as proof | best way to go! | There should be a negative 5 star option. Will never use again if I ever get my refund from a host that canceled my stay. | the site was not great at translating into english | Cannot log in. You've been inoperable for at least a week and now I cannot even sign in to my account. Your end it says. Try again in few it says. What, months? Years?? Come on. I have trips scheduled and to schedule dammit. 2/26/24 Same issues persist. Lost a rental opportunity because I couldn't book on my phone with this stupid app. You and your 'service' are entering never use again territory. Whose head is rolling on this failure? S22+ fully updated. | very easy website to maneuver through. Easy booking process | Forced app download | I used to love using Vrbo. Used it all the time. Now the fees are insane and make the initial rate fake.... by a lot. It used to be more then what you see, but now it's like $100+ more per day when you include the host fee co parts to what is being advertised when you get actual total. What exactly is a host fee? Isn't their rate their fee? What is this like the fake service fee when using credit cards they got everyone paying at stores? Rip off and deceiving all around. | app keeps freezing | Counter intuitive UI, but manageable | SSO OneKey thing broke it for me. Can't sign in. | Horrible app. Can't find what I'm looking for. | New update signed me out... Won't let me sign back in... Keep getting a \"Sorry we have a problem on our end please try again or come back in a few minutes\" So dumb.. I'm trying to plan a MUCH NEEDED vacation... | Buggy, glitchy, most times doesn't send messages | Unable to send a text message to the host via the app. | I cannot get into the app doesn't recognize my account. And so there's a problem on VRBOs end? Been trying for weeks | Needs constant updating | App constantly crashes, cannot retrieve saved properties, and the website version seems to be missing properties that should be visible as well. Not sure what happened to bug up the system, but please revert back to an earlier version. | Terrible experience. Property listed as available in the app had been booked for over a month according to the property manager.

HIGHLY recommend her and the vehicle if you are looking for a SUV while staying there!! | love it | bill - was so great, so nice, car was perfect, super clean n all was great. Such a sweetheart n he met us a airport @ pick up n drop-off. definately recommend!! : ) | This is a great platform | had 2 trips with Turo. Great platform. Awesome cars. Convenient and easy to use. much better experience than rental companies all around. highly recommend | awsome app. cheap rentals, awsome rental hosts | 1st time ever renting love the setup and price and ease of use. Very affordable this is the way to rent.for me and.my family from now on! | Adebayo knows what he's doing and made the process really easy even tho we complicated things. great car! no problems | Turo customer service is NOT top of their game. my first rental had to be cancelled at the last minute, and they tried to make up for it, but kept suggesting TOTALLY different types of vehicles that I wanted (I tried to rent an EV, specifically a Mach E, but they tried to get me in a Rav4, a Mustang (gas powered coupe), and a Model3 (too small). my first host didn't respond when I went to pick up car, then blamed me for not knowing how to operate the door. In the end, the next host was great. | the host was excellent and the car was great. good mileage. | The rental experience was easy and effortless. The car was easy to find and the owner was great to work with. | It was amazing the host was the BEST I will recommend him to everyone!!! | I love Turo. | The easiest process one can go through to rent a vehicle love it and there is a variety of vehicles to choose from. I got as lucy as to walking around the corner to pick up the vehicle I rented. | Service was great untll trying to add my mom as a second driver. Mom is not getting phone verfication codes, spoke to phone and chat support no help. | it was a beautiful car and although it was rented for a funeral procession it turned heads at every turn. thanks MIchael and Turo. | My 1st time using Turo. It was very easy. truck was clean and ready to go. | Great to experience vehicle rentals from everyday people around you | better than rentals! | easy to deal with. car was perfect. everything we hoped for and more. so easy to pick up and return. it really was just flawless and so easy! | Daniel was a great host. The car was clean, well maintained, and way better than I expected. will definitely try to rent it again on our next trip to Houston | great app, save lots on cat rentals and support regular people not giant corporations | Great company. Awesome customer service | best rental app hands down. Never had an issue yet | that was my first time to rent this car, is very good one | Great car, great communication. Thanks!! | Toro is a gamble simply not worth taking. My vehicle had mechanical issues and faulty breaks aromatherapy start which put my family at risk and jammed up our vacation plans. They have customer support who I dealt with for over 4 hours and countless calls over multiple days attempting to secure a sound replacement vehicle from a different host which eventually did come to fruition. the inability to provide a timely solution and the unfathomable amount of stress they caused just not worth it. | great car, value and experience | Nice | Great alternative to traditional rental | I've had really good experiences so far | love the simplicity of the app | I definitely appreciate Turo for having some awesome host with well maintained vehicles I will definitely recommend Turo to family and friends. | Alex was an excellent guy to deal with professional and understanding. over 5 star! | The rental was exactly as described. Cameron was quick to respond to questions, accommodating, and helpful. I will definitely rent again the next time I'm in town. | Doesn't connect to Android auto. The range definitely is below average so take that into consideration when planning your trip. None of the high speed chargers in the area worked, so be sure to plan extra time for charging. I was billed a 20x chargring fee at the end of the trip because Andrii picked up the car from the airport charger sooner than it took to finish charging. So, it was OK, but not great. I wouldn't rent a BMW hydrid again. | so much cheaper to rent from Turo then bog box rental places IMO | Turo is so easy to use and convenient. Their app is intuitive. The concept to connect people to rent their personal vehicles is ingenious. I use it in every city I visit. Thanks Turo! | Choose Ozzie if you can! Kind and professional. | This is it all for nothing new or this | this was easily the best rental experience we've ever had. Scott was amazing, super helpful, very friendly & his jeep was amazing! | Love it | highly recommend. everything was as advertised. Will use again | easy to use | The car was clean, easy to drive, great on gas mileage and I experienced no problems. The owner was easy to contact and responded quickly to my questions or concerns! | Turo is a great service for those looking for a car and not having to deal with big rental companies with monopolies on the system. Highly recommend! | Turo is a great way to go. Tried it for the first time. I love the fact that I can chose the time and date I wanted/needed it. I want stuck with a Monday - Friday until 5. I chose my time and could even pick up or drop off on Sundays. Regular rentals aren't even open on Sundays. I also think the cars are better taken care of because they are personal. | 1st time experience was great | great experience and easy to use the app and communicate | Made a booking which I cancelled because there were hidden fees. I made use of a 50% off voucher as a first time customer of which I couldn't find the code to reuse after the cancellation. Your customer support, which you obviously outsource to some third world country almost didn't speak English, and just brushed me off saying they escalated the matter. Here I am 5 days later, being unable to find the 50% code to redo the booking. 1 star | Chris was great to deal with! | Turo is the easiest way to rent vehicles . without all of the headaches that car rental places put you through. TURO IS THE BEST | So many more options than typical rental companies at a much better price! | Great truck and host | Great app and a must try. | Awesome!!!!! | great experience..will definitely rent from Kevin again. | Awesome Experience | The pick up and drop off was excellent. The car was clean and well kept. I enjoyed driving this car and wished that it was mine. | first time with Turo was great | Carlos was a great host. very responsive. easy pick up/drop off. vehicle was spotless. I would definately book with Carlos again. GH | Brian was a wonderful host. Great vehicle for 7 people and luggage. Easy airport pick-up and drop-off. I would definitely use his vehicle if we ever return to Tampa. 5*s. | Great car, ease of delivery and drop off. Will definitely rent again. | Great experience! | For me Turo is a Wilder West place. Host can announce one thing and deliver another thing. As a consequence, Turo charge you non sense fees. You feel guilt because, at the end, you need to stay for hours in a phone call trying to convince Turo that the host did something wrong even having everything documented at their own platform. | Easy to communicate with. Nice vehicle. Great service. Would recommend! | Good app and a very cool service. | My experience was excellent | awesome rental app I use them all over Canada! | Ben is great! He let me modify my schedule to meet some of my schedule changes. | grat guest | I really thought I was going to like this app. I've used it once just to overcharged for a rental. The original price that I agreed upon was $142.36. I was only keeping the vehicle for 2 days and stayed within the State. My card was charged over $300 and when I reached out to the company, all I was told were lies to try and cover the difference. How is that any extras you add comes up more than the original rental price. They said one cancelled. I never cancelled anything and I only rented once | beautiful car üöó I loved clean great trip, jomer very gentleman, hi way for me over 1 hour, thank you | bmw convertible... best car to drive through the keys! | This is a fantastic app. Way better than renting a car from one of those big companies. When this app catches on, I hope it will remain low cost. | Great easy to use service. | fantastic car | great place to rent a car | Great host and great vehicle. Pick up and drop off was simple and communication was on point. | car is good, price is reasonable, service is great. | great little car owner. Anthony was great to work with! | Turo is very nice and professional in handling situations, it was the first time I ever rented my car while Turo and it had an accident but the representative help me get the car towed and are still helping to file the insurance claim. thank you | Phenomenal service with Jose and his team. Excellent customer service. | Wonderful service! Very accommodating and friendly. Would use again! | Do NOT use this app. You are better off getting it from a rental company. Their policy is unfairly strict and favor the hosts NOT the renters. If you are late by just 30 min you are screwed. I was constantly in touch with the host letting them know I was on my way with updates. They said it's ok they can wait but as soon as I got to the car at exactly 30m late they cancel and call it a \"no show\". Now the host get to pocket the 2 days deposit and split it with Turo. What a rip off. ZERO leniency. | If there is a zero star I would give them it ! An incident happened while I had a car the claim department didn't belive me and kept on charging me stuff I didn't do ! Becareful of this app ! They kept on calling me because they don't belive me don't use this app they don't believe the customer at all becareful | my 2nd use of Turo, great platform. | 24 hour road service was completely unresponsive. Lost the tour fee and missed the tour because they failed to respond as advertised. The car was as described. no issue with the owner, only issue was Turos complete failure in habdling roadside assistance request. | This was my first-time using Turo. Charles has the vehicle at the airport on time. Easy to find. Great experience! | This app is ideal for renting cars directly from the owners! It's much cheaper than renting from other services! You can select the area where you are going to be and the available cars will appear.Very good for trips, you can coordinate in advance to look for it or leave it in a particular area. Highly recommended | if you want to try a car you have been wanting, this is a great way to do it. Have no negative remarks about the experience I had renting thru Turo. Had a great host and awesome car. thanks. | I rather rent from TURO than from Hertz. | Renting with Turo was easy. really enjoyed the car. | way better than rental companies like hertz or avis, this is like the 5th time I have used Turo and each time has been great. | Awesome host and awesome car. I highly recommend and I will use again on my next visit. | Great app. Very convenient. Easy and simple to use. Extremely excellent customer service! Best customer service I have ever received. well worth the money. Just absolutely amazing! | Smooth transaction | quick, efficient, and convenient, wish I would have known about this years ago, | like | Great ride. It has FSD! | My 1st experience, the car was dropped off by the persons relative and was not given a parking spot at the airport to find the car. When I found the car, I had to pay the parking fee. The interior lights were not working in the car. My 2nd experience, I chose to pay later and the money was automatically deducted from my account. Customer service told me to cancel and reserve again and wait 5 days for a refund. | Nice user experience | very good | Great option if you need to rent a vehicle. | Great car, great host, great trip! | First Time Turo user. car was good. interior had a few annoying little rattles in the dash area. but overall a good comfortable ride | This was a fairly easy/convenient way to rent a car. It was a better price for the car I wanted than the major rental agencies. | I really like Turo, it's like Air BNB for cars. I was able to choose one of my favorite vehicles to drive and it was so simple! | Platform is not at all user friendly and customer support agents are not helpful. | Great service but app buggy. Think I have scanned my license 5 times now... | RBRCONSOLA softpal real estate intelligence program certificate health insurance plans prestamista general | Turo is the best app for seemless experience in car rental. It is quick and never out of options | Fantastic experience! | great car service | overall great experience with the app | Awesome experience | I used to use OuiCar but it has been acquired by Turo. I am really disappointed : the app is complicated to use, many steps to book the car, no possibility to do multiple requests at the same time to be sure to have a car, too many information, complicated interface. Also all the comments on the cars are old and they do not inspire confidence. I was not able to \"convert\" my old ouicar account to Turo because the conversion tool did not work. Overall now, when I need to book a car it's painful. | Great car and nice person to deal with ! | vehicle had trouble and was replaced immediately. good communication. | Great service, fantastic cars!! | great app, very easy to use. slashes alot of the red tape when hiring a car from bigger organisations | very simple and easy to use. it has come in very handy in a stressful situation thank you | it took a few times using the app to get the hang of it but am pleasantly surprised!! | 1. They don't allow you to remove your credit card from their platform once you save it. 2. Additional Fees excluding taxes are almost 50% of the car cost. | hidden trip fees weren't cool at all. | love booking with Turo it is so easy to get in and out | Great experience | Highly recommend and her response Is very helpful and fast.. | Great alternative to the rental car companies. Sometimes the prices are better and other not. Suggestions that would encourage me to book more. 1) list the full price on search. I hate \"hidden fees\" and I have to pay that and tax anyway, so why not be transparent? 2) you can't see price for the same dates your already booked. Why? Maybe another car comes up with a better price that I'd want to book. Make that option available please. | Not working | Awesome | UPDATE: Turo will force owners to accept rides from anyone now. So if they have 1 star rating you still have to accept the ride . This is not acceptable. Great app used to lend out my car and make some extra money since I don't use it often. | Jim was a great communicator and the car was perfect for our trip. | Awesome | I've updated app and still it is giving me errors and I try to look at my cars. Keeps telling me to update, even though I've already updated | we rented a Toyota tundra ran fine look good everything fit perfectly luggage we needed some groceries I'll ask ski equipment also I did reserve an F-150 in the beginning they got back to me to let me know there was problems with that vehicle and took it out of service!! say no more! | Nice ride wish I had one | It keeps saying update to the latest version of the app when I uninstalled the app and redownload | Easy Process!! Thanks Carlos. | App forced me to do an update and now isn't working. I'm a host and it is super important. I also can't get in touch with Customer Service. I called and was hung up on me and the email listed on the site is no longer working either. | Booked the car (Texas) in July of last year for the eclipse next month! Reservation canceled by Turo 6 weeks before the rental. No reason given. Given the option to rebook, but the options now more limited and more costly, of course. Super dissatisfying. Y'all didn't have my back. Prior experience (NYC) quite good. | Great experience and much cheaper than other rental services. I'm definitely planning to rent with them again! | Great as a renter and host. | love the service gr8 choice of cars to choose from n the prices are the best I've seen outta all the car rentals I deal with | Constantly glitching. Sends alerts you aren't able to open in the app. Tells you to update without updates being available. Dumpster üî• | Great job from turo | This was my 1st time using & it was truly a breeze. Although I mistakenly booked outside of business hours they were able to accommodate me. Wish these guys were in every city I visit. | Excellent car, and great communication with Vito. I could not be more happy. Thanks. | very easy to book a rental and very friendly service!! I would defiantly be using this app again!! | Until Turo fixes their broken customer service, they will be nothing more than a novelty app. This comes after their app would not handle my drivers license in a secure manner and there only solution was to just email pics to the renter. It was an hour long process while standing in the airport. My next trip will just be with a rental car company that is serious about their business | This was the most convenient rental we have ever used. David was extremely helpful and gave us detailed information about where the van was located. It was clean and in great condition. We plan to use Turo from now on! | great service and experience | perfect great value. | good car | great rental experience | I reserved a car on Sunday. The owner accepted my rental, and then on Wednesday, they canceled my reservation due to too many miles and according to my agreement, there were 600 available. The trip I was making was only 120 miles 1 way for a total of 240. I contacted Turo and basically. I had to rent a car from Enterprise rental. I saved $200 by getting the Enterprise car but the bad news is Turo still has my $500. I have to wait 5 to 10 business days to get my money back. | Mario is an awesome host and we love the Acura RDX. thanks Mario! | This was a great experience. The host was great and a very easy process. | Waste of my time | Subaru Outback was perfect for my 2 week skiing trip to Utah and Lake Tahoe | Ronald was an excellent host and his car was amazing. Very clean and drove like a dream. if you want a nice comfortable ride with plenty of room rent this vehicle!! | great sevice | glitch with location | On Monday I had electrical issues with my personal car and Rachel was so accommodating. She had her Toyota Corolla ready for me within an hour or less. This car is really nice, great on gas and easy to drive. It was my second time renting it. I will continue to rent from Rachel for all my rental needs if she has availability in the future. | Great App! | awesome experience | Excellent thank you üíØ | Alot more expensive than posted, rented a car for 5hours, price 78$USD from Miami airport. Rented since the was not delivery fee, but had to pay parking going out of the parking once started the trip and was hoping I did not had to pay once delivered. Ofcourse bang 25$ more do the math, I could of just rented from the airport at Avis for 45$ and not the 128$! In total regret I rented from turo avoid turo at airport it's only traps for tourists. Tiro support send it to collections with in a week. | Turo is a super smooth process | It only takes one unethical vehicle owner you rent from to really unfold the horror that you get dragged into. Unfortunately Turo puts the entire onus on us, as renters, to prove that owner's claim on damage is fraud. Even though the matter was resolved in the end and I was proven Innocent - the awful amount of stress, and borderline feeling of going through a legal battle really left a sour taste in my mouth, and prevents me from supporting and using Turo service ever again. | would recommend turo to any renters that would like fast and sufficient service | better and cheaper than renting from the airport | Wonderful Host and Vehicle! | Kim's vans are top of the line and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice clean ride | Conway Arkansas the Buick crane dealership there is a Black GMC four-door four-wheel drive 3/4 ton Duramax diesel I need that truck what's my options to pay for it with | Great experience! | very nice extent servise | very nice people. the car was nice too | You never know what a service is like till you try it yourself. Great experience. Really easy to use. Thanks | wonderful host. amazing clean car with great gas milage! | Thank you God bless you amen. | Awesome experience and Dane is the best one on that app | Great app and so easy to use | Easy Peezy. This transaction went very, very smoothly. The car was right where Dominic said it would be. it was in good condition, clean, and drove well. I had absolutely no issues. I will definitely rent from Dominic again! | Renting and coordinating was super easy! Definitely recommend this. It was so much cheaper than the rental agencies. Only one trip so far, but it was a great experience with a super chill dude. | Excellent alternative to traditional rental cars. Very good app. One Heads up however ... Fine print says on the mid level insurance ($500 deductible), you are liable to pay it no matter who is at fault in an accident | Great App! I don't think I will ever use one of the big corporate rental firms again! | It look like that will be a good app . | turo is awesome and very helpful | it's a great alternative to regular rental car services. just watch out for insurance fine print | I definitely would rent the vehicle again! | Awesome platform!!!!! About to hire a car for the 4th time | Love this app more cost-effective, choose what ya want, & people are great & easy to work with | This is a company that has a lot of promise, but not if they can't fix: \"We're Sorry. Resources Not Found\" (as if anyone has any clue what that's suppose to mean). It made for a highly negative experience. | Second time using Turo, 3rd time will be when I land in Seattle from Fairbanks. I have not had any problems and will continue to book cars using them. | Great experience | allow all pinning rewards now | I definitely will be renting from Patrick again...very professional and nice!!","histogram":{"1":4134,"2":1012,"3":2154,"4":13697,"5":329038},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","available":true,"offersIAP":false,"androidVersion":"7.0","androidVersionText":"7.0","androidMaxVersion":"VARY","developer":"Turo Inc.","developerId":"Turo+Inc.","developerEmail":"support@turo.com","developerWebsite":"https://turo.com","developerAddress":"111 Sutter St, FL 12\nSan Francisco, CA 94104","privacyPolicy":"https://turo.com/policies/privacy-policy","developerInternalID":"Turo+Inc.","genre":"Travel & Local","genreId":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL","categories":[{"name":"Travel & Local","id":"TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL"}],"icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bg1O4i_B6JvGl8bRAs0XIjiKkP1vShLrrXfWjg0aKqQk1uFvn_4iQS5V9_V05i3VEoA","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Zv2d4N52mSBINNcw8iStC6Mlrmob71b8oFyKkrIYRS-G17dRd6Q-oaYVrsWQqLwgFSY","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bKxjUeeAbO-B3C_iC-lPWkHKsQeFZ3YQZf81RxChWr5UOzyiMzgkXfvNPQKIDzLbt-Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eY0SGI7tJqV52xOot1m8jJBiTSvHBKBcnksNMFHWnBknkh7kTnNRqaSa1epexBMRkA4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XcQ7vB0FVB8CBefSx7UXGgf-Y11IoDDEtF5E2WVg7aL-1W5JRkNxS8O_Eh4JwIYsGg0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/l7k4rR8cRD3GekljZv0YnHJDJ_8DqvnnZqMRXE4iKn0fTYf7SMfTNVW3w2o0VsGChm0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8Vpk3rh91yKGYPEnV6fCsOE6XPircl47HgPPzRGA52i6b4NG9OvyKmbeE-q6Q9jjpQc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vgEMsAmOB5nsTWHfqReuPKoyvZH8QQLoyRkYfaJ18UJvgz4NIgv_za3XoatMUuKKq7up"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/70DGYzp9i9I?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Zv2d4N52mSBINNcw8iStC6Mlrmob71b8oFyKkrIYRS-G17dRd6Q-oaYVrsWQqLwgFSY","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Sep 14, 2014","updated":1710785278000,"version":"24.10.3","comments":["I don't have a credit card or a lot of money for needless deposits and hidden fees...
