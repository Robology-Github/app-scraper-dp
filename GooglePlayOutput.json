The Community tab in the top-left part of the UI is small and hard to reach. Finally, viewing who viewed a message is also non-intuitive (swiping from the right of the message would be better). FEATURES Inability to share large files of any kind (mp4 , pdf...). Inability to clear individual private and group chats. Media quality. BUGS The profile picture failed to load; Default message timer had to be set manually for all contacts;","I basically think WhatsApp is a perfect messaging service, but the calls leave a lot to be desired. Almost every call I make on WhatsApp has a noticeable delay, which leads to people talking over each other. Very frustrating. There are also major concerns for me over how my data is stored and shared with third parties, so I am considering switching to Signal.

FB Lite retains the most essential features of the main Facebook app, such as posting updates, sharing photos and videos, and staying connected with friends and family. It has a simpler interface and consumes less data, allowing for smoother browsing even in low network conditions. Overall, FB Lite","Bad experience. Even if you block a page it will still display it in your news feed. You want to see less of the type of suggested page yet it shows more of it when you use show less of this suggestion. You block a page it will temporarily stop showing. After 2 days itvwill appear again in your news feed. It os just annoying that they are not considering their user's preferences.","I got kicked out of the full FB app for some kind of session time out and it was hung up logging out. I decided to uninstall it and install the lite version. It's been years, so when I try to reset the password I keep getting errors. I'm getting emails I logged in with the email and code, yet the change password isn't working and I'm not actually logged in. I'm getting either an unidentified error or \"no error\" in red.","I don't like the \"Basic mode plus\" thingy when I run out of data cause the fb lite won't open if I have no data and I can't use it. And the \"Basic mode plus\" has 20 mb so it's not a good thing for me. I hope you remove that in the app but overall, it's nice and accessable for those who don't have a wifi or data. And also put the old version like you can switch the mode if you run out of data. Thanks!","I only access Facebook on my phone, and mostly successfully. However...my one biggest gripe with it is the lack of screen space given to make posts. I'm not aware that I have any control over this, but the frustration of being restricted to two lines only, when the is plenty of blank screen space below the window, is very annoying.

To make sure you don’t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on.","comments":["Latest update breaks functionality with Android Auto. When I select a playlist on Android Auto, it shows \"no items\" even though I have songs on the playlist. In addition, Spotify causes Android Auto to lag when music plays at random. When this happens, I pause my music, and Android Auto works fine. Not sure if this is a problem with this app or AA, but it only happens for me when playing music from Spotify.","Bug with the newest version on Pixel 8 Pro with Android Auto in a car. No liked songs found anymore. I see people online rolling back to a previous version and it working again. I don't want to have to do that. Obviously love the app otherwise; just hoping to bring this to the devs' attention. Will increase to 5 stars when it's fixed. Please thank you!","You *have* to pay for Premium in order to use the app. Can't skip songs and can't listen to them in order, among other things, which should be basic features considering you have ads playing in between your songs. Jam is a great addition but it's sloppy, constantly pauses while listening long-distance. Mostly sticking to it because of convenience but it could improve in a lot of ways. Some things were overdone over the years, which is a shame.","This is a decent music streaming app, but it's quite awful when it comes to ads. I understand the push to having people pay for the premium version of Spotify, but at the same time, I'm getting 4-5 ads after almost EVERY SINGLE song! Even when it tells me I get \"thirty minutes of ad-free listening.\", I get an ad after one song! Other than the problem I seem to have with so many ads, I don't see much else wrong with this app. It's a great source for music listening.","Love the app, great features. One seriously aggravating problem: if I don't turn on shuffle, I don't want it on shuffle. I don't think it should be assumed that people want something mixed or a single played song. That's how my Spotify opens every time and it's terrible. Other than that, it's a phenomenal app and I would still recommend it to people."],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.spotify.music","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en&gl=AO"}

But there's still more work to be done in the area of clubs trophy. These recent non-competitive trophies you add as clubs trophies like Orange trophy, Santiago Bernabeu trophy, Theresa Herrera trophy, Emirates trophy etc doesn't make sense as per Clubs trophy. Its better you add only competitive trophies there. Thank you🙏","Great app, helps me keep up with soccer match scores from all over the globe. Instant score notifications, sports news everything you want you get with this app sports wise. Highly recommended","This is the best football live scores app I've ever used. It provides a mountain of information about players, clubs and leagues. The analysis section for matches gives predictions on who's gonna win which is pretty neat. The feature I love the most is that you can see ratings of players and teams. A team can be 99 rated, a player can be rated 78 etc. And of course, alot of other useful features. Would definitely recommend this app to other people. ⚽️","I disagree with the new price of NOK 43.46/year and kindly request to keep my current subscription at NOK 27.00/year. I also suggest improving the app by updating TV schedules regularly for accurate match information. Adding a filter for multiple countries in the TV schedules would enhance user experience. Thank you for your consideration. I value your service and hope to continue enjoying it at my accustomed price.","The program was good, but lately it takes a while to update the results of the games. A game at 80 minutes shows that it is half time"],"preregister":false,"earlyAccessEnabled":false,"isAvailableInPlayPass":false,"appId":"com.resultadosfutbol.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.resultadosfutbol.mobile&hl=en&gl=AO"}
